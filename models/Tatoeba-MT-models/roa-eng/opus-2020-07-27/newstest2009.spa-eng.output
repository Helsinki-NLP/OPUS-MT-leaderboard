The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions of ČEZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended about 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
Here, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the Secretary of the financial sector.
Loss of shares in Asia
The actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index during its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it mitigated its losses by reducing the decrease by almost 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises index following Chinese stock movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The stock of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the secretary of the Index descended to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions scheduled in the US are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said the Head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, the threat of falling will be felt in other countries.
Blood bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion should be dedicated (almost $12 billion).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the actions gathered the greatest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
The Congress Retires: The U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a compact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American finance system.
Your vote will be taken at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators resulted in a gap in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and of the Assembly Bank on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms for which market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made a great deal of progress.
We resolved our differing views on the way in which the package of measures for market stabilization should be taken," said Democratic Nancy Pelosia to the Bloomberg agency.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead to serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to carry on with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the market for fast-track shares.
According to Senator Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, legislators are doing their best to ensure that Congress is finally approved this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market, as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when they will vote on the two American Congress Chambers and even if they won't get stuck at the last moment with a problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and later $350 billion.
Bush valued the advance of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision but Congress may overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the recovery of bad mortgage bills whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the advance of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilise our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
The chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the program's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a mitigating closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help houseowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of payments to debtors' deadlines and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be achieved but rather difficult.
"And that's why we don't know what mechanism and at what price problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, already this week, congressmen agree on their support and give them their approval as well as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to achieve that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed Fight: MP3 Player against Mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 players manage to make calls.
What seems clear is that it's better to buy just the phone.
Still there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice is virtually dependent on the manner in which it is used and on the demands of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult to buy the most modern record player to hear in it the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is no single objective reason to keep buying them.
If vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues are swallowed in their shelves, it is probably dreaming at least of this type of play.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the commercial helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, including enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
Also decides on the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even that that which not even most mobile players do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as phone calls, sending messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and even can get to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge knows how to make a grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions it uses on the mobile before the display indicator will be illuminated by asking to be recharged.
And music reproduction is one of the biggest energy tranches.
Few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
So be aware that cheap mobile phones won't play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above all, they constantly call themselves still, for more security, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some un downgraded reader units can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices show only one directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, interest in the accumulator's resistance, memory capacity, sound quality and type of output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you're going to listen to it every day just for a while, as on the tram, then you just have any phone that reproduces.
What practically achieves any mobile phone.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and excepting it the absolute majority of devices reproduce music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also enable, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just through the mobile internet visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could in itself be a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the themes of fugitive success of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, this very way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends if you always wear a headphones or at least handsfree them.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile phone even if at least one MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even as regards the technical part, such as the phones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really any person handles them.
The minimum functions, their management similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record players are evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, gigantic counts for downloading data.
Which apparatus should be decided upon
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card, it will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only one 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cow, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (maximum 2 GB) more than 1,100 crowns are not required.
If considered from among the most demanding lovers of music get the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as one player's.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose phone on the walkman line has almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (normally 15 hours, with maximum performance up to 35 hours), the most cited brand brings you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long before we get there.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the Union.
After the final steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, it is likely to reach a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible for prices in the Czech Republic to remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competence that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
That is why the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a sharp drop in prices to which the classic operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into Britain's market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look for examples too far away.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the Virtual Mobilking Operator in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator achieved more than 100,000 customers and became the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they are enough with many fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that however, often counteracts the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers at least half of the price compared to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland can also be a good blow the bet by a trivial target group.
This operator is specifically addressed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works for this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could be stuck in our country.
From this the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it's about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," he said in a phone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly he assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition emerges.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it the Group GTS Novera who would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in it, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And how much sooner, better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said Pavel Kaidl, the group spokesperson.
So, maybe they're better times.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to reach possibly by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far, no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market concerns other operators.
T-mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "Even today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be hard to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study on such a short horizon"
Vodafone directs your attention rather to the fulfilment of the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is about spending and infrastructure sharing.
We think of it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - with operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry to competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure to ČTú was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile society.
Public information available on ČTú's ČTú websites is a testimony to this.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would imply for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously disappointing because of the absolute disregard of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just about ČTU's position, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This purely belongs to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator is closed.
To date, no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classic operators," added Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of operators.
For the offices that should represent the interests of consumers, it is something more than a consideration, besides that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the overseas where virtual operators work normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile phone services"
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and price reductions does not fall within the interest of UOHS.
Really the dramatically shocking in all this case lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in petrol stations because it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found any sign of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise of responsibility in their market operations.
The tools needed to open up the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," added Chalupa's response.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
Clearly there is a relevant market analysis developed by ČTU that telecommunications is from the point of view of the commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile telephony operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise sharply in a similar manner.
Current complaints from stakeholders (induced by the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators they are shocked by many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in ČTú is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We have already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was recently introduced for the extension of ČTU's competition in the field of trade tenders which was not implemented, even though a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known by UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one's looking
At the same time, unprecedentably something like a pseudovirtual operator that on Czech mobile telephony networks already exist a few.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephony services.
Normally only some elected ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of it ordering a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will later receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those quoted could be discovered, we could talk about a breach in the terms of contract that could be translated into the end of collaboration with the given society," answered Martina Kemrová's question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies cited that it can come to be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get a profit that is not negligible and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of the possible problems: "The law allows speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a demeanable so many customers.
These, moreover, must accept that the SIM card of your phone is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of operators."
This is exactly what should seem to the ČTU minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround the eyes in this type of procedure, why block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it must not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that its commercial conditions do not allow it.
When are we going to stop being the most expensive?
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this disruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases defended operators but their clients.
Outside with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and with it others began to appear.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience, we cannot help but be impressed by the confusion of the powers in these cases.
But do not despair.
If this information between the backs is correct and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market probably starts moving again.
If one of the operators lets a virtual mobile telephony operator enter, it will be difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may no longer call more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations from the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and another female voice, one with Coro and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are spoken of as singing.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can hear the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it has intentionally chosen for the Solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, too, with the Choir that were fixed in the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would have consonance," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates next year on 175th anniversary.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague's MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at the moment for almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the Info Centers and Transport Company posts at the Metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the evening, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket sales posts at the metro stations, where so far they had to regularly queue to get out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the internet, and the Opencard card recharges it to some of the thirteen branch offices of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with staff prepared to help interested people with the purchase on the internet and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus in the Opencard on the automatic vending machines that are located in some of the halls of the metro.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker machine and the travelers will probably have already set themselves in them at the stations of the Roztyly subway, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but at the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only in it.
The electronic bonuses from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the circular trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of central Bohemia.
"On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization setting the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The circular buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's locker.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the circulation buses and do not remember when the validity of the bonus is over can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
In 1945, the German Suetes asked that Smokeba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some groups of Swedish Germans were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the US President not to allow the return of the "Shumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts."
In view of the fact that Czechoslovakia's union with the Southeast Germans presumably presupposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president who assumes for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million people, we are being handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way cooperates with the victory of the allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the šumavas lands on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some experts very carefully paints the expectations of the Germans in the southeast of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit themselves minimally that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate for the Sudan some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Česke Budějovice.
This was in the war, like a German from Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was arrested by the British and placed in Holstein's prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, believed that on the basis of the Benes Decrees would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional Campaign which decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister, Aleš . .ebíček promises to deter drivers of dangerous behaviour on the steering wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be made to feel on television, radio, cinema, internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also to remind them that before starting the belts are held.
He wants to get to the consciousness of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embroider emotions.
And to this end we are witnessing the "bloody" announcements throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't Think" is written with big letters in the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that a man at a time of loss can come to pay with his own life.
Ads are going to "put fear" on viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
It promises that it will thus reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and whipping for drivers
"For drivers it is worth the sugar and milk system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and so saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says hospital transportation psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that's why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specific to the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of some danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not give you more attention," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all areas occupied for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinian and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all the lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll stay with a little bit of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to give them a percent alike (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Highs
Olmert also made a statement about Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highs, which in his view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hizbulá (Kita Movement), they must turn their backs on the continuing support of Hamas (Kita Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the cushions on the buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova we have the question of whether the seafarers and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the Zaphate is opposed to the law of road transit," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which last week the 25-year-old snail died was evidently caused by the truck driver only by the bus crossed the way.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly stop, and at the precise time when the snail distributes coffee or newspapers.
Here what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to technical permission, with places of foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jančura, at Aktualně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this removed him and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom and be on the bus if they have seats," he told us.
Azaphata doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of azaphate - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision forbids transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Reviewer of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is sufficiently addressing this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking places.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided among the urban areas, where there are places to stand and maximum speed limited, interurban with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to walk, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
The expert from BESIP in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no important problems regarding the movement of the seafarer on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Not even here is the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the snail can be struck in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly slows down that physical laws are valid.
Same thing as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of azaphate must be solved by the carrier's rules of procedure," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of azafatas.
He employs two hundred.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, at the moment I have the impression that the Zaphate post is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason Asiana lacks azafatas in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no flattery, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
A Vast Tragedy Happened
In the accident of the line joining Naples a young Pilsen Zaphate who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably rotated from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to prevent it, however, crashed with the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the roof were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book them for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the trial verdict on the girl's family's compensation but also wait for the financial expenses of the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the Zafata on the bus in which for a year, 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"But they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They do not devote themselves too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of azafatas to be something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is based in Frankfurt
In the letter from the Board of Directors of the West LB bank for its employees there are no big words left.
The merger of the banks of Dusseldorf with the DEKA bank can form ‘a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group’, as the written statement states, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the `competition block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
Furthermore, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just as before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the federal financial services monitoring institute, which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, much has been said about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August let him know that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the management board of the DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to begin negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just started, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area is the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation at one time seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, Hesse's government spoke against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was against the plans for co-existence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the public law area is necessary.
When the Bavarian Parliament elections are to be held, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that doesn't necessarily turn out to be good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it emerged much better from the financial crisis that the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a trade model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far did not give any answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank
As you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with the DEKA, that's going to show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already third or fourth.
But this time, Elena attends him as her girlfriend, and that's why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a handy, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the train station Porta Nuova, tonight at 23:45, three buses go out, ` address Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned especially for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
On one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial fur lining and glasses with silver-colored brushes, owns these buses.
For five years they have come to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 a.m. the round.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
By night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address "Brenner"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the quietness reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It is for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian license plate take another break on the bus 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are meeting, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowing the way.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign store are opened, that means walking!" cried Marco in the morning.
"Mark!" Go and occupy the back sites in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over space!"
One liter of beer, dew Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the tipine
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half o'clock you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, to the yellow caps on the trees, signs of traffic and even in a cartel of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
We wish to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and tormentfully enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria which makes a statistics of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians take the first place.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The banking system in Germany is relatively stable, and only last week was the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück.
Well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking field will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate finance, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to be able to withstand turbulence on the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Royal Estate is going to use has to be of interest.
The money comes as from private banks as well from those in public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financial with the money that was provided for long-term projects financed them only a short period of time - which is now no longer possible because of lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of the year, the bank's capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the share of own capital has also fallen slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued revenue from financial investment and net profits of financial operations fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some securities also those of the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses fell by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues from the reimbursement of compensation costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the consortium's companies, the negative balance could incur a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financial system at first was lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estates, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
Since there could not be much money to be made with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they were canceled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial finance in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, proves to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits dropped essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Real Estate Hypo needs nearly EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with credit the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not capable of functioning"
Other sources say that through this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the Hypo Real Estate Board of Directors, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that you do not need funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
I heard that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation can't reassure at least worried people.
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, loan courses according to the position on the property registry clearly tend to fall.
Affected are mainly the loans of former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturitys exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Real Estate, the present value of its loans that were formerly an investment for speculation must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are unaffected are still ready to support the system, so long as it can start from the depreciation of pensions in time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one can imagine - the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the cross-referenced news about partial status, now the security that is already at its limit became a justifiable hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, breaking their heads about the decision about their excitement isolation.
Short-term investors can still put the final point and use the new transportation of losses for future payments of benefits compensation taxes on change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When on the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Highschool in Tachibana, the girls started laughing: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was afraid before I went to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo at Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
Alone I had to find the way, lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had been touched to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who speaks well in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in one week will be my birthday.
At this point I was very happy that I had already started studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in class have sewn, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped on my spot.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt attacked.
Everyone talked at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation, they all pulled out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like mass tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I'm like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, the benefits are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a good deed made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally, I'd rather read Mangas for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a flak for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still don't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger runs away, why have you also been afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, acting in a similar way to us, feel the same way?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we get into the unknown field because hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as the other animals: he gets killed, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, and some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that govern conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the tongue, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if the conscience did not depend on the tongue, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as though, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's difficult to explain how other animals' consciousness works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my speeches relate to the content of the experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking their contents into account, and that is what happens during the short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential goes rather than the neutral correlations of consciousness than the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of the visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that part of the brain is activated in the emotional system that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens to fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex what distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature they follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, so does Jaak Pankseep, but it focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases also: But how can one control whether rats and men behave in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger of a cockroache run, why is he afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behaviour does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That is true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly distinct from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress is expected in the field of neurology as it measures the same for rats and men.
As I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The president of UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the alternate Prime Minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's confidence in its ability to organize the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Work is now about to begin and there is a lot to be done in both countries."
The hours of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries are busy.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
Now we have to do high-speed jobs," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off us."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
Following numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Miroslaw Drzewiecki Sport Minister.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
In the last season alone, many clubs in the first division were condemned because of downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and fights back.
The late war of the two roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors in Hollywood publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week at an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "inaudible that Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News."
Among other things, it is very "lamentable" that 16-year-old Jack, his son, again, "will remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently is a twin father.
And so he ends his statements by pointing out: "May my life continue.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
The prices of plane tickets and hotels are coming down
In the first half of 2008 plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, the airline tickets in Germany became cheap up to 50 percent.
The plane tickets and overnight stays in hotels were again cheap - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its reserve data for the first half of the year 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter saw a major change in the second half.
After for many years prices in the hotel market continued to rise, overnights in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe averaged 6.9 percent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of the "interests of American tourists on travel have diminished."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and record in Europe.
In the first quarter the prices of plane tickets also showed upward trends:
Because of the rise in kerosene prices, travellers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of the plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is, on the one hand, the increase in the slow economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane the demand is dropping.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borusia Luhukay still does not go out to make the decimal goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the national selection player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
Everything I wanted to say exactly reacting to what happened, you could read it clearly from your lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," silbababa Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance to Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the present were again in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades physiotherapist of HSV, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, the main coach in Hamburg.
His order was the same: look, the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have it "more relaxed".
The outcome 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
On Monday, Hamburg's SV is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday it will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky on the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its players forced late like the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the runner Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the chipo cannot shine with its successes.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," says Jol.
After the defeat of the vote
The Wall Street spreads fear.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package dropped some time down Down Jones at 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in your history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the world's most important scholarship barometers made a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Bank shares Goldmann Sachs lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to purchase so-called "poor" mortgage actions.
But the sum will be paid from one blow to another, but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the option receipts of actions for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state fund.
Action courses in Europe and in the US continue to fall
The aid of one billion for banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate drops and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the saving of the financial market projected by the state the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
Losses of the actions speculated by the Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's real estate stock had lost two thirds of its value for a period of time, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.

Dark matter influences the path of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the researchers to be bewildered: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threaten a cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused a misunderstanding among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the path of space probes during which they get acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example on Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sol Ulysses probe.
But what is surprising to researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
They are more frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now.
He was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even the General Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, U.S. physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain anomaly during the gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, where astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for anomaly may be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to possess the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists abducted in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers of the Sudan had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
The Germans always fall again at the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
As a result, European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information presents the state Egyptian television, the radio station of Arab television Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news on the release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to put an end to the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "received hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report the kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to remain in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
A stepfather's abuse "brought suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by their stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, was sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Truro Court, through an investigation, knew that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to life in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, which after being a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "forsaken to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have killed herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended by saying, "I used to tie her and wink her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, if she hadn't, the question probably wouldn't have ended in court."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the less serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to criminalize.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner reported that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is loaded under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the staff member must be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain construction companies could face a price of over £80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley bank rescue/save.
The Government, in fact, provided 14 billion pounds of sterling to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million bank savers.
The interest on the loan shall be paid by all companies using the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that companies and their members should pay
Eventually, the loan of 14 billion should be reimbursed after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest payable in the internal market is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members in front of what could be a relevant price," added Mr Cole.
Interest gained in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of eligible interests, which may be almost twice as much.
Since the societies of mutual construction organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest in their savings.
The milk price rises by five pence per liter
The people of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra fivepence the liter from the next Monday.
This is the second increase in price this year, after an increase of two pence in February and then the investigations carried out by a consultancy firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the higher milk price had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Denied of bail from former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His advocates said that the court did not grant him bail by charging him with extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various charges of corruption in charge.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, militarily supported, grant him first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what are the terms of his release or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers say you will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina claiming that he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad under parole," counsel Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said it happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation of 17.9% in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought his share package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about ITV independence and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce his ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, said BSkyB, he would have surrendered his voting rights.
New investigation into the recruitment of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the general inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of the officials of the administration.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former General Producer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"With complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for under-performance.
But it was later known that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, gave up his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, which "absorbed" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf of Much Honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at Q Awards for its epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special prize next week at the London ceremony, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group are running the nominations for this year's prizes and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity like the one that was used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf stayed about nine years in the classifications and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - Real name Marvin Lee Aday - has experienced health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It then emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready to sell
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the Primera Calle – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty street more than an active route.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find on an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the Primera Calle
who wants to revitalize Extra Place and create a clean passageway to shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-fashioned neighbors who commented were enchanted by the truncated track simply because it is one of the last remains of the block's past before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has street control, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Committee of the Community of Vengeance for the Use of Land this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, District Manager of the Community n.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the little street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, she didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than management.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark in history.
Some believe he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's big estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that rises on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket a Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village burgering, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they are, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremias Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made part of a talk about the history of the city on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and unexited alley, also dark for the day and marked by oxidized iron and counter-window storage doors, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canalons."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested that you could get a cleanup.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I've spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and filthy places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transition bilingual education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, in class, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Let's take Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent have dominated the English language test and the arts.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that favoured him by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, continuous evaluation of competences and does not tolerate an excuse attitude.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to English instruction to students is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means almost exclusively the use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one that has arrived since Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating for other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the response, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been defenders of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The share of crude oil decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning negotiations in the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before regressing, once again, because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety seized the investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress they said had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seems they could not reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to be lowered.
"The prospects for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate are going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast of reducing the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent by 2009.
Second room of madness: equipment sets record
After having spent, during the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without annotation into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with skill under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it occurred that Brett Favre's quarterback found Laveranus Coles achieving a 12- yard goal and suggesting the perfect foreplay for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, Cardinals' defense was beating Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another one and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, the mistakes forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 3.4.
These are the major points the Jets never made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When you were told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third room - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second room much more than the third.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrsselassie leads its world record
Once again, Haile Gebrslasie from Ethiopia has shown because many consider him the greatest runner in history, overcoming his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 miles race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the camp accommodation in wool at 2:03:59, Gebreslasie destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length, so it has set up a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-redred race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate its problems with asthma.
On the other hand, he pointed to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees starting the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebreslassie won this Sunday, employing on average a few shorts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told the journalists that he had suffered cramps in the pantorilla two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the object of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Oriental rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his careers too, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the paces as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their pacemakers decreased.
But just before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took one last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as an injury on her back, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes at the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners head-on and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and testing of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet camps, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not one prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Eatonville fair to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city that she described – also making it a tourist stage by including it in the trip guide of Florida produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going to be lost."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the subject of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very careful about the way our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifetime resident and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a level of poverty twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the South Black - sometimes derogated, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's not surprising, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
A And the concern about Eatonville's image really started for Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "The Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
With a concrete face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left hand," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow's new husband Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells all kinds of drinks and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Evidently, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as an eccentric living woman who returned often after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin continued.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-way main street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration had, inter alia, brought to an end the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around the city to shoot oranges and every thing against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl once, too.
He was thrown against a tire from the car."
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the break-up of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because I was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with loudness, confidence and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker left until Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a well-known biography by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canons.
The road project came right at the time when Eatonville's most famous daughter went under the reflectors again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road on five tracks, would have been to put in what you would call speed of curvature, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Registry in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a remodeled and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from the center of Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street from the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as that founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A Early permission is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced teacher with a weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community might be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also emerged a higher level of native pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way as Mrs Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not worse, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, dumb and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
Here, in New York, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize to be in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nesting offices that are above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers monopolizing New York are facing daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1920s.
Girls for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between loaded apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric stamping shirts hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to take from the morning, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. in the evenings.
Employees still expect to queue for their bagel to salesmen's carts, and however it's impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there is, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers of all lives order their cheques, tourists seek instructions to go to the big stores of Macy and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal banker of trust", and they were queued for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes in their home city whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and who say they treat customers as their family.
Last year, 15 of these banks silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, broke in, and as the New Yorkers headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that stood before me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed executive director, Dick Furd, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the shopkeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs at the Time Austria Approaches Right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the extreme right-wing party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgium, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citizens Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing the mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the extreme right-wing political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, where the police believe it was an organized action.
The delinquents sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of profanation, which came to the Muslim religious when Ramadan month was over.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that ended almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign centered on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the head scarfs and the burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamist policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad on Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the audience at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police asked for a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's foreign travels like France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad on the basis of being registered as sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said it wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: "Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: "Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of the sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged 10-11 years.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
One source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and glad to know that Glitter had been forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
"Capto al maestro out of the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great teachers of flamenco, stripped of concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Side by side the artist.
To the other, the person.
Inseparable save in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hands, carefree because they are not going to go out to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some set-up with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the schedule of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy... captivated to the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the taste of the "Sing of the Mines" festival, Bauer began on 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a board camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical base of the image, confirming modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, the song or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captive with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the dunde that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canals, Vicente Amigo, among others, set this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment into their life, either a long or short moment.
I think that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don't even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the Galeria El Fotómata, located in number 20 of the rue de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a fearlessness"
It is set in places that you still don't know and talk about unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and passed through Amazonia.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in its passage to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a fear" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it once," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he has seen passed through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the outside of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience who made him very short the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "external adventure" of the "placer of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and doing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis upon which their stories are sustained.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and to know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more confused", so he asked the writers "not to abandon the brittleness" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
The climate decreases the fair of Pozoblanco, which is also run out of areas
The regional feast closing the sale of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced areaers that the square floor was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the race.
The meteorological circumstances have swept away with this fair, as at last two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second race of bulls.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lock of Castilblanco.
So, only on Friday was the feast.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out to the shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante jumped his two sets with greetings and an ear, who granted the tendons more than his bull.
That is, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a fall of relief a large part of the audience was won.
A check in Álava goes out in a truck with two thousand kilos of hachis

Its load, more than two tons of hachish, was not to stop.
The officers persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Basque Government Department of Interior.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport check at the N-1, in its passage through the municipal term of Armiñón.
A van was ready to be stopped for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, speeded up sharply, and ran out of control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the arch, when their two occupants pressed to flee the race for a forested area.
Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized of the 2,178 kilograms of hachish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish weights, so they were transferred to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so a crime of falsifying public documents has also been charged to the arrest.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding investigations and will be available to the court within the next few hours.
Stops actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her performing strange maneuvers trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, according to the People magazine a spokesman for the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and going back several times passed over its sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess of alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison over 7 p.m. even though he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callares urges the Andalusian federation of UI to assume its powers in the Silva case
The coordinator of UI and Deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the training that will have to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being charged with family treatment.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," said Llamazares about the action the party will have to take with which so far council in the Seville Consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always argued that these kinds of issues have the greatest degree of transparency."
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions."
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspiring in the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria at the front of a wide list of performers.
May's blood, with a film of more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in the cinemas, to become a future miniseries for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great fan of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures he has fulfilled this film "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community three years ago commissioned him to film a memorial tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he always accepted when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has made available in its entirety is a "one-stopping opportunity" for Garci to set up with the decorated and the appropriate wardrobe the portrait of "an atroondated Spain that was wrong as a leader to fight for, as the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding like that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of the Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Return to begin with has had an impact on what is his usual form of work, the setting up with the actors, with whom he usually tries before the shooting and those who do not casting, as it seems "humbling" and considering that "part of the director's profession lies in going to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters that coincide in May Blood repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year in the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood itself of May, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected one, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be made known", he has assured.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you're in line with making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Serbian dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillana dancer will honor a sevillana dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of father Catalan (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and mother Andalusia (Georgeina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and when he was three years old moved to London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of Wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character and it seemed amazing."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell your life but to collect your spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly's dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake's dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the character of maturity.
I'm happy that I agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rap of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its scope, and who always are in love with them."
The work also somehow tells of the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, since she was habitually resident in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's those women who have enormous influence at a certain time and now nobody knows and much less values their work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8:30 p.m. at the theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recented Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is framed within the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Zenobia Trienio and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel Prize and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramon Jiménez: That Chopo of Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Similarly, the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recented Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausence of malice," and gives the idea of the American cinema's disappearance, and from all over America, in view of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
Look, it cost them an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was very ill.
It's still been a break for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
Nobody was afraid to make fun of it or exaggerate it.
A father of cinema and country had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without virtue the men and well few beings who admire you stay, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was incarnating for everyone an ideal almost platonic of beauty and true.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and cattle causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn killed by overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A whole gift to a country that has been hard to overcome to a suicidal food culture.
The expansion of Hollywood's neighbourhood admiration without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he died not a man but an era.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us the list very high," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dares to try to live today as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He got divorced once but then married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he surely had the opportunity not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven, he is proud to see his daughters on earth coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, of none was as proud as of the devoted husband, loving father, solemn grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to celebrate in Madrid an Olympics and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst career I've ever been in.
A level of misappropriation that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I would examine it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
Disproposals begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't seem wrong to me, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first purpose, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' cut for the T-shirt (second purpose, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis they've decided to buy only small t-shirts with less and cheaper fabrics?
Well, things like these are a little bit compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Over 35 minutes the wait lasted, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to be expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting period of more than 40 minutes, which was combined with tales of popular rebellion and assault on the cassette.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the classification, due to the chip that they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark the exit properly.
Of course, if you asked me about the perfect career, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies Conference, it has shown a breakthrough in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move around the company's campus) paying attention to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the video show the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him he will see you soon.
Everything without a blue look.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked a lot over a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essentials instead of loaded commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All one find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extracts" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing its importance, as well as software.
When Google Chrome went to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the required layer for Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and is finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I have a small example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of Microsoft's employees' rest rooms, in Redmond, early in the month.
In the refreshment machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather than shooting at 2010.
Microsoft will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was carrying her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was reading one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of blood', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the gay musculated parish uniform.
And if we start to list starry appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp moustache force that was lifting weights in an outing circus.
In essence, it's just the typical male underwear shirt in cotton, ash and no sleeves.
The 'tank', which call the talking angles, but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands on top of all the others.
First of all, for his reimbursable name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because he receives his name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognisable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babes, mini shorts...
You are designed for underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is short but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they're a lot more than some pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the Mango firm makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish home sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have created my sister Penelope and me for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new Mango collection based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love cinema from the 1950s and 1960s; from there we get lots of references.
Then, I really like to lose myself in a city and watch women get dressed, like they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of links in common.
I liked the clothes as a child; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to steal from my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to look after my clothes.
You know that dancers love to make us our style for lessons and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you really find the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've fulfilled not long ago 30s, have you been in a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asked by the body and I also want to be a young mom; this I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, all I want for now and of course, cannot be.
I'm looking forward to 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they think...
A few days ago, you started on a walk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up to a walkway to make a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we display - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I who know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever gets me to ask me to do the pine, too.
To benefit the women of the third world, what is needed.
Drivers who are re-accidents by alcoholemia should install the alcoholick
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, to have to install a system in his vehicle that prevents him from starting the drunk vehicle, or if he does not blow it.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General ' s Office, which states that it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so it will also receive a course of re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the Procurator General de Seguroida Vial, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once by driving drunks return to take the car.
Alcolock would avoid it because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the rate of alcohol in air spiral and prevents the car from getting started if the driver does not blow; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than the allowed one.
Its cost is higher than the 1,000 euros and it would run on account of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a 2007 U.S. study showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviours before they lead to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, however, the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow for an initiative by the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 a.m., the scheduled time for the programme landed at the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was retreating but his rays still forced his hand to use visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
On foot stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before I had asked around the street, the taxi driver, if I knew the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, so you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, mellows to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF they threatened the storm.
They give a smile and a listening stop to the photographers before they go to the room in which the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four large in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best prize gifted from fashion
There may not be a place in the world more suitable to present a fashion prize, that Paris and possibly there is no living designer more exquisite and bont alive than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is endowed with a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs at the Mango window in number 54 of the Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost wept over the emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest shop in the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us finish at a luxury dinner at the Paris Garnier opera.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the Presidential Gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with her heart broken with grief and heart-stricken threesomes, for her brother's recent death, put on a costume of the House and some ELAH dressings, which cut off her breath, and her son Luis's arm - a canon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner homage.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honors and is so gentleman that he finished, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because they had both borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for dinner she turned into a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'big fold'.
Ines Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace's dependencies, but before she showed us on her son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canon moving by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with their sheets, their towels and having previously ordered, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And by the way, they are all gathered together in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being wrapped up in the busy pace that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number rises to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
It also offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very busy telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk are sleeping.
The first time it happens to the best, you're being scared, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign disturbance of the dream called sleepwalks.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them have told you he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to sleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be like this.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's a little-study phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and thus giving him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another alteration of the dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress table).
What you can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
Therefore, seek quiet games and avoid TV shows or TV series that are either scared or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who find it very difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during various episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common thing), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to dream of information.
You won't get anything, because when you're sleeping, you're not aware how to organize your thinking.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of saying that, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal occasions and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting where the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rumble the squad with a long shot, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
On the front, we did not stop the camper and left Riahi alone in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two shots of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illousians with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhusiens will not be able to taste long their happiness and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and leave their teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illusians who backed up a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last few seconds of the game during which, after an important butterfly, the ball passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds furious fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a ride for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome it " with a constructive spirit " and hoped that " it would come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures in response to the rise in gas oil prices, which marks a record of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elíseo David Martinon's spokesman, the President " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The sports port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-Iola have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed on Monday their determination burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the cows stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about 20 ships blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday meeting which will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil price of less than 0,30 euro per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and one destiny " died from cancer at 83 years of age at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes saluted the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.

The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats in the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivery devices, reaffirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has a lot of confidence in the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would seek to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been driven by American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper needs.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its subsidiary of air leasing, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its loan of 85 billion which the Federal Reserve has granted it at risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98 %, or it was never seen in Bag of almost 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14 %.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684,81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, i.e. the day on which the exchanges started again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which was technologically dominant, dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the index encased (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Plan to save the banks that would have allowed to recover a little stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the Secretary of the US Treasury Henry Paulson the media he requested.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"That is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza said, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late."
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions further," said Brian Bethune, head of Economy and Finance of Global Insight.
And intensifying the sense of urgency, " every day the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, causing emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The return of the 10-year treasure bond dropped by 3,632 %, compared to 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4,161 %, against 4,357% on Friday afternoon.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, another happened to find out who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel which has been followed by one third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's allowance, although honorable, was not "slow enough" to allow him to slow down in the polls five weeks from the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday, grants Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges that it is the democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good expected benefit of his member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned, however, this weekend.
Septuagenario McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, highlighting the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first concern.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge needed to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without discriminating, he was concise and precise.
It emphasized its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a downpour.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode ", he estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton ' s during the financial crisis of 1998.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the end result of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless reduce the taxes of 95 per cent of Americans in spite of Wall Street strikes, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates avoided the issues of the $700 billion ($47 billion) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk," "Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents manifested last Sunday in the afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator must resign " .
Some recognize that they have not voted: "for what, since they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made good for foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been side by side with the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," lamented Iuri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, stresses, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition come into parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament may mean TV appearances, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26 % of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Question the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centres.
And there will be at most five members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public's confidence that it had been seriously vacillated by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada made a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was late to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, says Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence " , says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebec population had in successive confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary nevertheless recalls that " trust is something extremely fragile " .
Since its inception, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended the birth in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious illness can emerge from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of those who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But some years ago, it has been shown out of all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests that enable the presence of the virus and not of antibodies against the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, in which the evidence used so far was based.
Nuclid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the moment the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period by less than a week.
We have thus substantially reduced the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of HIV transmission occurs for a blood product.
I believe that today one can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries," says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It's never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant " , Dr. Décary pursues before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
" Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since the most aggressive anti-carcinogenic treatments, patients often need injections of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors regrouping only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation on an average basis. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
Pancy is very rare.
But members of this donor network have to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to give their blood, but above all, to hold them back and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," is plagued Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Hema-Québec not only supplies blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical wastes is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord-blooding program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this, since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) on the coast of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampist Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first goalless time anywhere, the centrocampist David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal occasions.
Roger Levesque was the only one who destroyed Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first round-and-coming game of the parties, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwilla, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured by the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take him for 4-3, but the Whitecaps accessed however in the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced with the Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – The Victory Goal of Kovalev
Three-one Canadian is willing to start the season.
The composite unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win at the barrier-free shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this profit, the room of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play maximum in the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ends, Jean Charest went yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) tries to get himself elected during today's partial election.
To reject the limits of our last great border of the north ": this is the long-term ambition Jean Charest presented with visual strength by staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, of mining operation, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the labour force with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonys with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a gem to immense potential " but did not give a term, amounts of investment, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territorial twice as large as France," is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it at our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he requested a national founding myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the river towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
Moreover, " with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said about the northwest passage, which will be opened each year because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec party in Ungava), have already begun consultations around thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " but a meeting at which " a common vision " will be given.
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be agreed, ordered and environmentally-friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have otherwise thought of transforming the challenges into new occasions of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party was able to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, she invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which is permitted by law.
It stresses that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The general weekend council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec, in particular, called for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up implementing it.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs Marois next to her candidate at Jean-Talon (vote made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action appeared to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said Sebastien Proulx leader, in place of Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letras - A Dishonest Country
He is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper Cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "regardless" for Canada.
So dishonor this woman who has been in an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says about the relations of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not returned to their national who is confined to the concentration camp in Guantánamo.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were recriminalized to him occurred.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and allows a soldier-child to live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who fears with false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still don't realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that's the word that Harper keeps repeating and that doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no morals exist: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as a minority (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends the Virtud, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euro defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecution, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will soften the opposition in addition to terrorizing anyone who dares to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore enough for the mining to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to be untrustworthy of public opinion and rejects requests and supporting letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate with contempt for his views?
According to the vice president, this word seems to refer only to very paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, the detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal way of the mining.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not on the basis of what many people perceive as a bit of persecution-bite (following the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a request with regard to Noir Canada's authors by intimating them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease rich companies in this world in a country such as Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to reply.
The university world, which we belong to, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's merciless persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he wants, he has no desire to engage in a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that aims to stop the financial crisis that has struck Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elect of their implementation, of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of embroidered houses the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelossi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
" We made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets " stated the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to put the economy and ordinary Americans to cover the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of Americans will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg declared.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a further failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour they had set themselves was the opening up of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have been admitted late to the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, but not forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that would enable the owners to keep their home and over the salary of the leaders of the State-survivor companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable ".
The 700 billion plan seeks to buy with the taxpayers' money the dubious debts, the risk assets and the inventible assets of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgages of risk before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican electors who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have emerged from the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to smooth the roughness of the whole world in Congress, we also added a provision that would stipulate that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to be added another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another Congress vote.
Instead of helping him, Washington will obtain shares in the assisted companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures for embargoes relating to housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on the cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote by the House of Representatives from today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is not yet sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the camera finance committee, told his voters that "with all the evidence, Washington does not want to understand ".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But it is not the benefit of taxpayers."
The Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an invigorator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken," said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to buy its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) during the crisis of venture real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the savers and families now appreciate that times are uncertain."
During this time, across the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and over EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes have for so long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their deity, their sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have led him away from the record of power that the true holy monsters have.
But what a great runner in the back!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years of age, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed a lot and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a Jewish German father and mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born from these European roots.
No demerited ego, last quality brand.
Because in it a whole country was projected in love with the self-made hand, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and soon in cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the auto driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the world of show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, while his great roles on the black screen of memories are being intertwined.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual displacement parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the cute cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgivable in Somebody Up There Luxes Me (Marketed for Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This nice manger in the sumptuous movie The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
Still him.
The times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on unorthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role of godfather of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition in 2003, the laughter was rumbled.
Contrary to several movie legends that left the race quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its faces and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its benefits too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, goats or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman showed off his true púdic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
The one who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of smell and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, he also hid a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen his face reign on the boots of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, even though it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What do they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, on many occasions justifying the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the town halls - in total some HUF 65 million - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was made known by researchers too, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in the public contests with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the accusation, most invoices were false.
To do this they obtained the heels in the market of the district of Józsefvaros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company the falsified invoice was to be carried out was decided among others on that tour by the Upper Balaton region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and they served as a model to make the invoices they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Hall.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András , who according to our information rather wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this food center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people don't fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however on the bill consisted of hundreds and thirty people.
But the great-favorant invoice manufacturers also overstated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft food centre, as in the book store - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and of Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he knew they were fake documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not many people belong.
In addition, meals were also included in the invoice, while the restaurant has been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoicing manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of this company were not charged with 25 but only 15 per cent of VAT, and the hotel's employees only extended machine-made invoices, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "stewards" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue these invoices.
The falsifiers did not pay attention to the fact that when Fiatal Városért Egyesület's group ate there (2001), Nyíregyháza's HIB Kft. was in the process of liquidation, so the officer in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
The invoices were sent out consciously
Another group of false invoice manufacturers were those who were aware that they were to issue fictional invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapitvány , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialistták, issued invoices worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Foundation Együtt at Harmadik Évezredert.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the charge - convinced him one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices of approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to record in their documents to this entity.
The next group of fake invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL manager with a fictitious seat in Budapest, who was dealing with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices of approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhallas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued to the company invoices for Atlasz, for Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapitvány charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian albañiles at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But it took advantage of these companies, as at the request of their accomplice counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generató.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri company to issue fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
For this to be undiscovered, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing can be the confession of the principal defendant János Zuchlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: What interest does it have in doing so?, perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUFs - socialists came to an agreement with him to have Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied him.
While the many perpetrators of economic crimes of far greater value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can expect the sentence in their own home, he has no chance for that.
Superposition Psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are prone to spend more money and overvalue the product.
The neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose on competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and while the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of self-premium of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups waged against a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members were betting.
The other group was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York, established.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world, some five million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and disease are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are propagated by two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sembling, vagina mood, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be protected by vaccines against A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, is manifested by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that they appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the dark-colored urine and the healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected patients receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent destroys liver cells in palatine form and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control is therefore very important.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting with the family doctor by experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the body virus, so it can be suppressed the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who they believe in God?
According to the results of a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
The Oxford University scientists had an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - the British Telegraph reported.
In the framework of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it could be verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which, alongside academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians also participate in the different departments of the University.
The analysis occurred in the following way; they fixed a chipping instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their eyes on two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and to the Lady of the Armiño of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious theme painting or the other.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safety" as people "protected," they "resolved themselves and peace reigned in their hearts."
As they observed the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positively, like a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on pain regulation if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
At its tenth birthday, Google can say: you can be found both in the pocket of people, and in the sky above your head; you know where your vacations went, what doctors visit, and what interests you.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, sceptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as many personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original objectives of Google's founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world is still in the early phase of the effort to be able to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years Schmidt replied as follows: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best suit me?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple until there is enough information about users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their network navigation the search keywords, IP addresses and pages were carefully stored when the search ended.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-schedule what they were looking for, what they opened and through this history will generate much more customized searches -in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about watching Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also surrender to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights, in May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, demonstrated successfully before the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, it is not possible to compel Google, through any of the points of the constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get its pretext to reinforce the Children's Protection Act passed years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and some 1,000 search phrases, but not obtain the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: those who fear to supply their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is damaging when they start using Google's services, and rebel against it as against conservative multinational image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as the conqueror of the World, however much both strive for the same goal.
This may happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package is constantly updated and looks more young, more collaborator than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred just by one of the key words mentioned in recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: show ourselves.
A normal young person can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers list of their music habits, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, they can also have a blog, where the most recent photo galleries that are stored in Flickr or Picasa appear automatically.
We can know many cases of which, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photos of the next morning of the common friends, is understood with whom she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because she writes her sincere opinion in her blog about the company's direction: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
A person's "on line" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of the youth of today.
And if you want to hide something, or at least try to avoid Google's monopoly, you can do it (e.g. by starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but don't leave traces).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being able to find them, but they can replace Google's "on-line" applications, from text editing software to image applications and reading news with alternative versions that don't connect with giant servers or prepare the perfect profile for us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its real face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are being introduced more and more rapidly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
The critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, senior management flatly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's babysitting, they considered the unlimited number of employees to be too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company under the agreement filtered all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they won't announce any new services in advance, but only when it's ready to work, what if it's safe is that the foreseeable problems of the next few months and years can be brought back to the world: while some believe that Google's scanning project and book archive will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the United States Supreme Court, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel by Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the prints to the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about Ozd's double murder, who, as suspected, helped to erase the traces of the crime, said the spokesperson of the General Public Order Commissioner of Borsod Province on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently accused of crime offenders.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of killing several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was prepared long before to commit the crime, for he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police are examining with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - by one hundred percent of the actions of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the Polish offer, even though the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have been offered.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week stated that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the increasingly profound international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US President - La República de Roma - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the draft law made hastily, whose aim is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", spoken of by the multi-millionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more correct to speak of a "second September 11".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the view of El Mundo, the error of the United States political leadership was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is increasing, and this will then affect the entire world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress's vote there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
You cannot ignore this threat - points out the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts on the financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominoes go down even further, then they will no longer be enough neither the new funds, nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary in the long term that the Member States of the European Union leave aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis only received more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, just as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming more real.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis going on as a nightmare for the Old Continent .
The "savior" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the suburb
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, but to imitate the sensors of obstacles in nature?
For example, that of the suburbs.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the beekeepers gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic management system of cars type BR23C mimicking nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the benefactors, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all the collisions.
During the flight each bee creates its own ovaled private space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of PR and development and research.
An important role is played by the eyes composed of the benefactors that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser-ray length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to prevent collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle mimicking the movements of the alleys, changes the direction by turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any existing system at present, this manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what one beeper does to dodge other beehouses.
This process must be done in an open and close the eyes.
However, unlike the binoculars, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonals, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the beehouses to dodge other beeholes, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and acceleration in addition the braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and its energy density is higher, which means they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, not much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes, no megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to his destination, avoiding existing obstacles on his way.
This dearest child is already named.
The written version of the $700 billion financial ransom package law has been prepared to be applied in several stages in order to buy bank credit.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to hours on the east coast during the new consultations that lasted until midnight on Saturday, the conference leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have achieved an important progress - said Nancy Pelossi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, claiming that the agreement is only needed to be formalized in a document.
The commitment made to the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment stated: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelossi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning it back into the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the draft law called an emergency law for the economic stabilization of 2008, Monday will first vote on the North American Congress and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelossi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The program is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars to buy bad credit fund securities.
Only half of the $700 billion will now be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities of credit funds, of poor rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other “vengeous” types credits as well.
Purchasing can be done in auctions or directly - informed competent persons in the ministry.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, is dealing with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the risk prevention that could lead to the demolition of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we can to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for State aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the US argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain specific cases will payments be limited, in addition the limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
Limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank retires.
By directly purchasing bad credits, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the compensation of heads is not overstated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the revenues of the directors general - said this measure the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to obtain gains with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill for the next five years, the President will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what American citizens have entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting the dollars of taxpayers - declared the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow-Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him the same as those responsible for the demolition of Wall Street.

Is next year no visa needed to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian agreement on visa waiver to enter into force about 12 January - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, in front of the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, " virtually everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on time on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time he warned that in the new system the entrance premise will disappear, but tourists before they leave the country of origin must register.
From today on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy has been holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice handing over the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major US parties, assured Sunday their support for the government's $700 million banking support programme, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, following several marathon-style negotiations, announced in the morning of Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues were put to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage that he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to vice-presidentship.
At a Detroit campaign meeting, held on Sunday last, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is at risk employment, saving you.in addition to the whole industries and stability of the whole economy" - he said to a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not waste the opportunity to call McCain's economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "all of us will take this to heart (...) but not doing anything is simply not a viable path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control commission for the fines minister and the limitation of executive compensation, he insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister on a daily basis.
President of Congress Nancy Pelossi said on Sunday that the congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
News magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" examines the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polithologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed his position.
The social-Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are giving their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been anticipated for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the rate they were very wrong. However, secularization, educational results and settlement of northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and it also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious, more critical, and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones that have moved away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the ones who have baccalaureate and the diplomats.
This resulted in less than 40 percent of CSU support.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The Conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is shown open in all directions to negotiate, the greens on the other hand still do not wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let some of their decks down.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, at the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the era of Schüssel-Molterer.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offerings.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open to the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Jaróka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France, which is also president of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, a Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in his message addressed to the whole, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations which plague Gypsy children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma remain out of the labour market first because of their low level of education.
"Most Roma young people have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to give broad awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the sooner the school begins a Gypsy student, the more likely it will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and to ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - Lívia Jaróka said.
According to the honourable Member, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up school disintegration processes immediately. That is why proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the possibility that democratic space will be guaranteed so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Jaróka said.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level of Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in his positions, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-called "criminalist" twice made a point: they do not hold to their positions.
The aim was to reassure the angry members of his parliamentary group and of his basic organization, who one day after the "bávaro Tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will certainly have to form coalitions with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the Liberal FDP and with the Right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the Free Electors list, Gabriele Pauli entered the parliament, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly removed from the scene to the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition you will also receive an active role in Stoiber that so far has been moving the strings in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU called September 28 as the bitterst day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the elections in September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that to hard pain he could hide his disappointment because of the failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained with the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country, Alexandre Lukashenko, on the other hand, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather with the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million people, made up of a hundred and ten deputies, has no opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (WHOZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, would "allow" the entry of some members of the opposition into parliament as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the imports of more expensive natural gas from Russia and contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians permission for having an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, by evaluating the election campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the primary report of Monday of the OSCE even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
All this in the view of the opposition is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready to face a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago considering the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one in the back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - told our newspaper Alexandr Millinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime is afraid to allow such an opposition to enter this weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, but rather tries to get the voters their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are making difficulties with their distribution, but I also see that it is increasingly those who support the change between older people also - Milinkevich said, alluding to that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even for retired people, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Because of the country's indebtedness and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security is "like the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, qualified democratically to the elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on she gets breakfast before she starts working"
It has never happened in the Chigi Palace History that put automatic doors to control the entry and departure of staff.
but from today it begins with this measure against the person who files and then goes to the bar to have a coffee at work.
This news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta, "are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services."
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is Reformism," Brunetta points out again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is important also from a symbolic point of view."
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General says: "there has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and midnight.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences from public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that more effective public administration is needed
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta Decree by acceding to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work because of the causes of illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of 'low workers' is constantly increasing.
There are millions in Italy who are employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of economic treatments added due to sickness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which medical checks of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions dear to the Minister.
Working accidents, Napolitano: "Criminal prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testifying to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates 58th national day in all the provinces of Italy for victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their dimensions, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of the young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the focus on the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm of social gravity, to implement and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined commitment on all institutions to urgently bring an end."
"The data on accidents at work seem to point out a slight positive move, but this does not remove the number of white deaths as impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not really want this "tendence to decline" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that the tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at the general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - Mercandelli has stressed - greater controls and inspections, but also stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - because it concerns communication and public awareness.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers over a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced the "progressive deterioration in the level of subsidiary care provided for victims of work" and the "assistanceal debt towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker the insurance guarantee - he has added - because the luck of the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers on charge, put hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music over a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
As far as the European Commission is concerned, in a communication in Brussels, it cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and newly identified health risk (Csserri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day with the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at a high level of acoustics may unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – the EU's responsibility follows – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and deliver this public domain information.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and step-by-step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it gives rise to.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures might possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits to 100 dB the noise level of portable musical devices, but concern increases as the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as lower levels and noise exposure time.
In its view, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that portable music users are listening loudly (but not 89 decibels) to music for only 5 hours a week exceed the currently in force limit on maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be counted between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today, the accounts will be closed in March.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Folly of the Capital of Rome", which was set up this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the gates were closed in March, the board and the municipal council evaluated analysis and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its principal Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to underline German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council can then be endorsed.
There is no remaining position of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the principal – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
He who accuses the Commission of being useless, since his opinions are not binding, German answers: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are displayed back and forth.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
He also pointed out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit to its future."
A future which, the author of Rome needs" was not limited only to the present communal boundaries but also to look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
First anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who interests him to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he does today gives private citizen) to the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date is approaching.
he wrote a Miami lady on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face of stone: he thinks he'll win the nation's highest position that he's had two governors and five black senators!"
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will it be a good president? And there are also the polls; they all say Obama won and with a good advantage.
In this case too, there is a person who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Journal of the Mississippi, in the entrails of the South United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
It goes one side of the American mindset covered up to the last.
"Just say what you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama can win, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Also, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Who will assume the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
It uses, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, though, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not wanted as the majority of the public understand it to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" journalists warn has increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with "work security."
The executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff, it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "disease" followed during the year.
It's a whole climate issue.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL DE ROMA, DANILO COPPOLLA IS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola that he had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
The couple investigated for bankruptcy in the field of research on the counter pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl climb.
In the course of the arrest process in his office last week, he obtained his home release, transforming it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate can travel the city of the province route to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm had voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites at risk
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, ever more divided among its old East Coast soul, moderately, in favour of federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong above all in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of those who spoke at the beginning.
This hardly mentioned is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and emerge.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual status-sovereignty category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance those who have strong financial relations with the outside world, but, above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or have little to say: the crucial test is the European Union which divides as always between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules, and above all the grant of funds: from the moment it comes to court it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the ever more sophisticated technology network, the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will in turn have to be more and more accountable with the little immaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look at you, can certainly be transported from place to place on earth but are equally bound in absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign, he certainly possesses many more letters about who he is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that stood for a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into their hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of poor economic relief with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in the rise, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an "revolved" election or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say anything, make it always more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape today is the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewed, increasing and potentially changing in dismediation.
In front of all this talk of a 'mass rebellion' today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future to walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the aim of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have stuck a body of 100 kilos over a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecos' paws, covered with microscopic hairs that can assure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily removed from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
CAMINAR BY PARADISES? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
Another RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, in California, is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented a adhesive made of microfibre like hair that self cleanses from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: Never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken concomitantly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, efficiency with serious health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit juices are packed that freshs associated with the taking of some medicinal products David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of apple juice, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, cancelling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Apple juice had already been charged because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
FARMACOS TO RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter of information two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case if you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why we should always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicinal products that are taken up and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not leave us to impress, clearly ask the doctor or the pharmacist" stressed the expert from the agency Ansa.
The Economics novel to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical of the Bush administration's decisions on the foreign economy and policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack, in those days that broke Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a great deal of controversy and that for several years has been reproached on the economy, but has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a divulgator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to attract ever more users, from the house to the office to the public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year's work from the volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less thick revised interface, other more consistent are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format(Open Document Format) 1.2,the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to multifunction with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules like the one that allows you to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphics processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphic of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in several users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to take some of OpenOffice's functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to that for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to the home or to work.
And if the topic of free can be a hook for house dissemination, it is in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even a lack of the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which prospective business opportunities could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and lastly Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that up to now we have reached nearly 3 million 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we will be able to exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth doping case
New positive case on the tour of France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classed and winner of the best range of the climber.
The news is the website of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 is the fourth-generation Epo-positive runner, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
The tests of the Kohl blood champions enter among those performed in the last few weeks in the laboratory of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position on the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical decalation.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping at the third-generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared the Associated Press to have notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has stood on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, helping the best climber's plea.
IMMIGANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS THE QUESTION, ITALY IS A RACISTA?
Italy of a country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? Is this what is asked by the New York Times in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of galletites.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they register "more integration and more work" but also the country's highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest North League support."
As confirmed by the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation, dear to the League, tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The tendency marked by the Pope is that by the President of the Republic: "Gioorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the last survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the highest costs the family would have to bear – explains the head of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a widespread growth process even for residents."
Unless in most cases the rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no canon limit, sub-linked rentals.
For Sonia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the review of tax taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for one bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for one individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for an individual room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is only saved if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle area and surroundings.
In Naples for one bed you can get 300/450 euros, for one room you can spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you can get 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
in the most girls cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EUs is more frequent, there is further anomalies: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinemas close up favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "are as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion were shared," observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the Oscar cousin and the grand jury's award to Cannes, which recounted the poetry of a provincial cinema and nostalgia by the way of living the cinema that might be lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: over the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and most of the rooms in the main cities are to be paid: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 less cinemas, following by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these three Italian regions themselves have made the largest number of new methonic cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec," it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequentes are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 million and 18 million euros a year’.
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historical centre that in the periphery.
The planned rules include means of tax facilitation for managers and advantages to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking rates.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true that in order to contrast the extra power of the methicons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, it was the spark that convinced me to carry out the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had thought about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Way already closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters darkened by the dust, I turn to the other side."
The link between politics and 'drangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The charges are heavy, which the judges of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate give to the steward and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the steward of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, a man of the boss, already convicted by Mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Undespite any legal and moral rule, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family would have been allowed – the judges write – to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of the control and command of the public administration."
The president of the regional board Agazio Loero does not hide that "agreements between organised bad life" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'drangheta, heroes that remain clean'.
This morning's arrests are added to those of last July after the police had announced the head cut of the Piromalli mob family.
Since late April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the responsibility of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the steward, of the Udc at the time of dissolution, after the balance in May 2006, had been elected as head of a right- center coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question to the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Pyromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the Mafia families."
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage
It is an extermination site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the great global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, investigations have intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of the world's electricity requirement could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of waves of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much as produced by nuclear power plants at present.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and more among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," said the spokesman of a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish ones are small in size and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bonding between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders within them.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine wires.
For now there are four such implants under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, makes the turbine pallets rotate, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, is currently worth the potential of tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
