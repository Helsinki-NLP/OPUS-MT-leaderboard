Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with the need for care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown case of etiology pneumonia was reported to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with VOCID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which heal.
In approximately 14% of the cases, VOCID-19 causes a more severe injury requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it to the evolution of the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (U.S.) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative impact of 14 days of cases of COVID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8.00 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a dramatic increase in around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in relation to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It was found that at 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks previously or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in the selection protocols for patients to be tested for COVID 19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, physicians in affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with ICDOC-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that the hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of VOCID-19 to hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not submitted).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection in order to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios for the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% of the overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid assessment of CECPM risk related to COVID-19.
Since the cases have so far been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally receive a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be established at level 2 of the Statistical Territorial Units Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-COV-2, as well as an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care, as in affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized in the recent rapid risk assessment of ECMCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by moving from a detachment approach to a mitigation approach, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for policy makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have to cope with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The disease epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-COV-2), has until then led to more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, leading to a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-COV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicative, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this subject of full-scale research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will contribute to better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the entire golden week and for other weeks because of the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (COV) which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; therefore, SARS-COV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before expanding to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number one," potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 with the virus sequence isolated from several patients.
This review seeks to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in a growing degree.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and forecasting of the disease, and will address some issues that are still pending but urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common rums 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which triggered an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is thus the third epidemic of coronaviruses in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig..1,1 of pneumonies then of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the town of Wuhan was quarantined with the interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered as the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO called the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
To the extent that the situation is rapidly changing, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was growing in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the periphery.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC-95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of VOCID-19 were gender (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing a single-brin RNA.
They can be classified into four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect the human belonging to the alpha and beta types.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and to dipeptidyl peptide-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-COV and MERS-COV, respectively, and a membrane fusion occurs.
Viral ARN genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-ronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken at the site of origin of the epidemic, the seafood market from Huan to Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
Using electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-fine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a recipient of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
However, SARS-COV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than SARS-COV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes less infection than SARS-COV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b and a protein secreted by the orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of IGNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known functional domains or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the Cryo-ME structure of the complete ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-COV and MERS-COV came from bats and were transmitted to the Man via the civets and camélids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-COV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect the Man remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., gave the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted bats to the Man by the snakes, which would entail a homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-muzzle mammal nourishing with ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by genetic homology at 99% between a discovered coronavirus in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 per cent gap between two genomes is a difference of importance; thus, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally free of immunity from SARS-COV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its innate immune system through molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
In various ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly remove infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-COV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction from the immune system results in a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which may result in severe lung injuries as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, multivisceral failure, or even death.
Infection with SARS-COV-2, which is characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study on the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine according to a specified period of incubation, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus is quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the disease occurred.
Patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea, and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family and a home after the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher degree of mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
Regarding SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disease (13%-25%), and that ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of VOCID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
Comparably, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 range ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-COV-2, MERS-COV and SARS-COV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often travelled or resided in Wuhan or in other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients may be carriers of the virus again, stressing the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white peripheral cells (including lymphocytes) in early stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Choracic X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or a depleted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increase the risk of pulmonary collapsus.
Therefore, the most worrying chest examinations often coincide with the severest form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with viral infection pathology and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical events began to be used for diagnosis (which was not based only on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a SHERLOCK technology-based protocol for the detection of SARS-COV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-COV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape in less than one hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients who are reinstated, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies all work to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-COV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-speed oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary derivative technique used for the treatment of critical heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-COV-2.
An excessive immune system reaction has been established to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other cytokine immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, cytokine blockage IFN-., IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibition, blinatumab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressant and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and VOCID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including a vascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of short cycles of low-to-moderate corticosteroids was recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of remedesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Reddesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remedesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-brin ARN viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead forwarded the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with the lopinavir/ritonavir combination.
Interaction with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients restored and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients with contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
As a result, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients with COVID-19 and injected with 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are required in order to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies may cause excessive stimulation of immune response and cause potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat patients with serious disease is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes that code the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have severe disease remission.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proved effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 have been observed in provinces in China that used CTM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which had only used TCM for up to 30% of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study that compared treatment using western medicine (MO) only and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It appeared that the return time to normal body temperature, the withdrawal time of symptoms and length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through larger-scale controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally experience deep concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those who are quarantined also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early years of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among patients regarding the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as to any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission of animal and human vulnerable host-infected tanks and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce strong long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS went off 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for the MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein sub-units, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important time frame (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritise their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 are the following (Table 33):
Age: Age was the primary factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% over 50 years of age according to a study conducted on 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a forecasting factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-COV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with ICDOC-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be related to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may result in liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Anomalous laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CPR) rate in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a factor of potential prognosis of the disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity, as well as the prognosis of the COVID-19, was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also participate in the development of the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the case of tissue lesions.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in combination with other elements for determining the prognosis and complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with VOCID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, as well as the death of close relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support in order to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, VOCID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 is also replicated effectively in the upper airways and does not lead to or little symptoms in the first phase of infection, as is coronaviruses at the origin of common rums.
Therefore, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients with severe disease, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are being made in China, including the confined Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decreas phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be out in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the samples of the middle nasal cornet and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their release from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial estimates, the Ebola virus was to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectiousity to eventually extinguish or evolve into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in soils, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of the cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Caution should therefore be taken in order to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five stacked surgical masks on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus might have penetrated his body via the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health care professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses to the contact of patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with soap that is more frequently disinfected than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potential infected persons.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new human virus, its high level of homology with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert condition after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre reassured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message resulted in a remarkable release, especially at the time the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show greater sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than expecting formal reports from doctors or official organizations; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) conduct more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system on a regular basis.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-COV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing of this report, it has spread to all China and almost 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and that the symptoms of VOCID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the epidemic of VOCID-19 gives rise to an impression of already-view.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also greater among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality than VOCID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by patients with severe disease, so it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-COV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 DNA detection tests may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients restored may be positive again.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiroppers.
What is the intermediate species that allowed transmission of the original host virus, for example bats, to Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract exactly and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly as the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
In addition to the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases with a period of incubation between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, failed liver function tests and high kreatin kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of SARS suspicion.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower airways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, significant efforts have been made to research the HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an acutely evolving pneumonia.
Contrary to SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of the MERS in relation to pathologies with HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most fatal viruses known in humans.
Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-COV and the four community HCOVs (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-COV-2 can be detected in saddle samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable diffusion after transmission to man, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCOVs causing moderate symptoms have been well suited to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCOV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCOVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this regard, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more the number of infected people is important, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by forty or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, SARS-COV and MERS-COV, highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCOVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCOVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifiers of HCOVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCOV if it houses a nearby ascending sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic for its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses HCOV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a host natural reservoir.
In particular, since 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also use amplifying mid-hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known as SARS-COV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-COV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-COV.
This is why bats cannot be the MERS-CoV intermediate tank host.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that drug dealers were HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralized MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels extract the virus not only through the respiratory pathways, but also through fecal pathways, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility of pangolin being one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than the distance between beta-COV associated with SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, zoonotic origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could be derived from the bat coV, while the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another bat coV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camélides were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near the HCOV-229E were found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with the alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the bat related to HCOV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaca caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCOV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the bat's alpha-coV is used as a genetic reservoir of HCOV-229E, alpagas and dromadaires could be used as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromadaires and human dromadaires.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in drug dealers for decades.
He has adapted well for these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoirs.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-COV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-COV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several opportunities for inter-species transmission of the SARS-COV-2 of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via decomposition or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by chewing and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species, both in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on animal origin of SARS-COV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-brin RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
Nevertheless, VOC mutation rates are about one million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the rate of change is often high when the CoVs are not well suited to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-COV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to man.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another human-friendly host.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to the MERS-COV, which has adapted well for drug dealers.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make short-term ineffective vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Third, the CoVs change randomly and frequently as a model when replicating the RNA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during the inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein S means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and S-protein of SARS-COV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCOV-NL63 also links to ACE2 but with a different part of S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as N aminopeptidease for HCOV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCOV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural reservoirs of HCOVs, such as bats, dromadaires and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCOV: return to the departure box
The diversity of bat coVs offers many opportunities for emerging new HCOVs.
In this sense, bat coVs are genetic reserves of HCOVs.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-COV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, given that SARS-COV-related bat viruses were isolated, but were coding divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is seen as an adaptive change that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in drug dealers in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the mouse and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the alpaga alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a reading framework gap.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "reduction" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not an accident if three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions are.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the CoV replication.
The same dissociation strategy of the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
For example, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-COV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat-coV of bats sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV have been discovered, indicating that pangolin can be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs came back under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the bat coVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion occurs.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animal to man and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses.
First, if the bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real middle host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-COV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous).
The main medical objective of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in infant mortality during births at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by simple behavioural changes, such as soap-washing.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
Washing hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could result in hand-level eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too often handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
The deforestation twice a year, associated with the daily washing of the hands with soap and the daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soils, are difficult to soluble in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that ordinary know-how was as effective as antibacterials for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and savoury water is more effective than cold and sandy water to eliminate natural oils containing dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water did not help reduce microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a hygiene product of non-aqueous hands.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thicker agent such as carbide (crylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the side effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or water solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace an adequate handwash unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of alcohol solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than known and/or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic material on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have presented long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the land or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Weave a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
The soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
Fratter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and to fry longer remove more germs.
Rinse with plenty of running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands come back more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and a scaled nail polish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a cane or gourd suspended and pierced and/or using ash as needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tip-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crutch using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bread of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands with hot air, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the thumbs and 254% on the palms.
Dry-hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the 42% finger pulp and on 15% palms.
Following hand drying, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different dry-hand manufacturers, and the hand-dryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital personnel forget to wash their hands.
The medical washing of the hands shall last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands foam and rub.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("germs") and avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, it is necessary to prevent water from leaking to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after you have taken care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are the most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash their hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
Nevertheless, the low rates of hand washing may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be included in the campaigns to promote the hygiene of hands that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap-cleaning is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid smells called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters depicting "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the sinks in the public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "handwashing" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.

'Cause it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary modifications of virus genomes, which are most likely to follow the pressure exerted in the selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
For example, complete ORF4 loss can be mentioned in the HCOV-229E prototype strain, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the mouse and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the alpaga alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a reading framework gap.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is removed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of molecules in the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "reduction" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not an accident if three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.

On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the CoV replication.
The same dissociation strategy of the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is particularly strong in bats.
For example, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-COV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-COV-2 appeared following the general scheme by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While a bat-coV of bats sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the markets have been discovered as the same virus carriers at SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV have been discovered, indicating that pangolin can be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although issues remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either on a voluntary or on an accidental basis.
CoVs came back under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs in the transmission of VHC to man.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civets present in the markets, closure of fresh product markets and slaughter of the civets found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the bat coVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not lacking for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and combine, causing the emergence of new more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in man in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion occurs.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of man being in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animal to man and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if the bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real middle host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-COV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help to clarify the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we replied to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspected case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called acute acute coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was posted online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has raised a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are slowly progressing on the basis of the results of the current studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for diagnosing and treating the COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have been published in a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially changed.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and also provides a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (the seventh version trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspicious case must involve one of the characteristic elements of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological events:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious SARS-CoV-2 cases (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in the 2 week area in a reduced area such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical events: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts from the beginning of symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnosis shall be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-COV-2; (2) severe sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with the new known coronary viruses; (3) positive serologic test for the IgM and IgG antibody of SARS-COV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-COV-2 from negative to positive or increased titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified persons who did not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to forward their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19 deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in one day.
The country thus records a mortality record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded the million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted for the extension of the 15-day national emergency; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the tendency to reveal how devastating and potentially deadly an infection with HCOV could be.
Most HCOVs come from bats where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoirs of some HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also help to better understand the CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, VOCs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The beta-CoV genus contains the majority of the HCOVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the genetic source role for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human coVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
The rendering of zoonotic origins of HCOV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future infections.
The COV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to increase in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headaches, sneezing, malaises and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present around the world and appear to be broadcast mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia Reduce Limit Amounts of Toilet Paper by Purchasing
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of two toilet paper and one package per purchase in all stores at national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently had reservations out of fear of the COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for deliveries at home to a package per order.
These measures resulted from the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock break within the time of delivery," and qualified the request for "unprecedented", while AlDI, in a Tuesday Facebook publication, called it "unforeseen".
Sales showed a "high rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while AlDI made earlier stocks available for a planned Wednesday promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, stated that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on delivery times by truck make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early stock unlocking, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector of the University of Queensland Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky article, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider that if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchase] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce the panic," explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Givens Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleinex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufacture Sorbent paper, emphasized that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first buyer during auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Work Party.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page package to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report of ABC Australia's March 3, in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand and flour hygiene products.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies the COVID-19 pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
“We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He stated, in a statement published by CNN in February, that "no other respiratory virus has been observed since its emergence until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
To this he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be mastered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the decision of WHO in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "The situation is going to get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute coronary artery syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of VOCID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Almost 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fever, cough and breathlessness.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining suspected people to be infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by setting up restrictions on travel, quarantines, curfews, risk controls at workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages exacerbated by the purchase of panic.
Schools and universities have closed national or local in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of origin and Asian appearances of the East and South-East, as well as others from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an unknown case of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was initiated early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the seafood wholesale market in Huanan and thus it is thought that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely related virus to the coronaviruses of bats, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person who presented symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent link with the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
In the case of the first household reported in December 2019, the two thirds have shown themselves to be connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified South China Morning Post report suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019 in a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to decline in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19 years of age and less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. The UK Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before reaching effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of persons tested at COVID-19, and the test has been confirmed positive in accordance with the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who had only beneficial symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, up to January 23, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated, and these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VOCID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the period between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been charged to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years old, and 75 per cent had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official accounts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who have been tested positive to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of VOCID-19 could be much higher, as it might not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times greater than the official count of the deaths of the ICDOC.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the sub-evaluation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, therapeutic options, time since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-deceased report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-of-death report is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the death-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethal rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of persons diagnosed with a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represents the percentage of contaminated (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who suffer from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on lethality estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, usually infectious epidemics stabilize and then start to regress when the disease just lacks available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
The Chinese chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for one or two years."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is transmitted very easily—disappears completely" and that it "may turn into seasonal disease, likely to reappear each year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of VOCID-19 are sometimes not specific enough and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, fainting, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, persistent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and face or lips bluish; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then researchers issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio assessments vary from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and onset of symptoms) oscillates between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of persons with COVID-19 who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during the expiry, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons may land in the mouth or nose of other persons next to or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, his nose, or his mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has ruled out the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however propagation may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms suggest that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few confirmed asymptomatic reports in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easy the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Precisely, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the British authorities recommend that they wash their hands after they have affected animals, as if they had been in contact with other areas that infected persons might have affected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacronavirus, subgenre Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is the same as 96% of the total genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolins and humans.
The comparison of the genome as a whole has shown to date a maximum of 92 per cent of common genetic material between pangolin coronovirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is made by inverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing the PCR and scanning at Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner should not be used for screening or as a primary intention test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses inverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sampling but also a gorge sampling can be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomodensitometry (scan) of individuals with symptoms include asymmetrical depole glass opacitys and a lack of pleural enlargement.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
As a result of cross-checking with other infections such as adenovirus, the unconfirmed image by PCR is limited in accuracy to detect VOCID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive neurons networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in imaging both on X-rays and scanners.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease include overall having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding eye, nose or mouth touching with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who had already been contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential displacements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spread in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions and contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone tracking data by Governments in this regard has raised issues of confidentiality, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limits to such monitoring.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at the COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, it's not effective to brush its nose and scratch with mouth bath.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop it.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before they eat; and after they have bitten, coughed, or sneezed.
It is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 %, and iodine povidone at 0.2–7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucone, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or a workshop, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by the sick persons be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbows or a handkerchief when they cough or sneez, and to throw away everything immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the posters projected by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions that explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Having a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks for healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they are looking after a patient with COVID-19, even if it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not to touch their face.
Several countries began to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical tissue masks. China has specifically recommended the use of medical masks that are disposable to healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks in themselves and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited exits in public without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, has imposed the port of the mask on passengers by train and by bus on April 1.
Panama has made it compulsory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a handicraft mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and malls.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowds, avoiding contact and maintaining physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum level of meetings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies has been reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there is no known presence of VOCID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system have an increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus, the CDC has been invited to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by maintaining social ties, whether virtual or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" meant that it was necessary to use total social isolation instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sexual intercourse only with a person with whom one lives, who does not have the virus or does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for persons diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and those who thought they were infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most risky groups.
Persons who have been exposed to COVID-19 disease and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to stay in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were last exposed.
Epidemic control strategies are detachment or suppression, and mitigation.
Dedication is established during early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Mitigation and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what we call flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distancing such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as cleaning of surfaces. More drastic measures were taken to curb the epidemic in China as soon as the severity of the epidemic became apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and quarantines, and issued warnings on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have been quarantined, and has inflicted heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the acquisition of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (the reversal of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Removal may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because otherwise, transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VOCID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking non-prescription drugs against cold or drinking as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID tests-19, canceling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive at COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronaviruses in the Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market for large seafood of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital in the province of Hubei, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the central Wuhan hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for propagating false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation early January. At the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major railway correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364 000 were cured.
Some 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted movement and established border controls.
National reactions included measures of disability such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or confinement) and curfews. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subjected to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people were confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world had a form of confinement, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would resume on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown case of pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "pleading rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "obvious evidence" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine of human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop the trips from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshhenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built: Leishenshan, in order to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government instituted new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of leave of the Spring Festival.
The universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
It was estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half of the population) were involved in some form of displacement restriction.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that although it was not "certainly a recommendation from WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of a "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked at the 2009 influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that the USSPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures should interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".

On March 11, WHO stated that the Coronavirus epidemic could be considered a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction."

Some Chinese senior officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the Coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories claiming that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," stating that in China "the censorship has overfed a virus now a global pandemic", which has then been taxed by some opponents to "turn the attention of the incapacity of its administration to contain the disease".

This has also resulted in a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to the daigous to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been a real success, avoiding the serious food shortages in Europe and North America.
As a result of its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
The food rays were only temporarily emptied, even in the town of Wuhan, while Chinese government members released pig reserves to ensure adequate population subsistence.
Similar laws exist in Italy in order for food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.

According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were blocked in their homes in domestic provinces or trapped in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for assistance from the government.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could be up to 32 per cent, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. Angus Reid's survey noted that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit, and nearly half a million German companies have lowered their employees to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both self-employed and self-employed, worldwide.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, entertainment halls and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and representations cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the period of Christian penitence of the Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, on-line and on-line or on television while others propose to practice their worship as a "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome that closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter Square, which emptied itself from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of the Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the greatest interruption of the world's sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 British Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disturbed the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were initially due to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "planned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted a lot of players to register online, and many online gaming sites have found a significant increase in their number of new entries. The show's world has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many great theatres, such as Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
Online, many internet memes on the theme of the coronavirus have spread as many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dated February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also noted an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to sensitive new countries, the Italians, who live in the first European country to undergo a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has made Twitter angry.
The Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for qualifying the coronavirus as "Chinese virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the unit of the Bengal-Western Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them."
The comments were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were attracted by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" that should be "done".
Many pay access newspapers removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic of free access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory detection of COVID-19 and associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronary artery DNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including individuals whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic individuals.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests conducted in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
By using inverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngous shield or the expectoration sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal shields is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In patients tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in the deep airways by aspiration catheter, or a crack (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 by means of an inverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), and constituted the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-COV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency clearance from the Chinese national administration of medical products for a SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their RT-PCR diagnostic device in real-time from the New Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three obtained conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the Atlanta CDCs, and an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency clearance.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of VOCID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID infection detection test-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency licence (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US from the FDA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using isotherm amplification technology for nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronovirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 literature study concluded that "pulmonary X-rays have low diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] may be conclusive before symptoms even occur."
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include multi-lobular depole glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
A sub-pleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. Radiology College recommends that "the TDM is not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals from about 7 days after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CRTs) or by patient's head test (point-care testing, POC).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For POCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody screening tests.
As of April 7, 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.End March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibodies kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspected cases can remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients crack inside, return and receive the result of the test later.The British NHS has announced that it conducts a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the framework of the COVID-19 test drive for suspicious cases, a health professional will collect a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, some test drives were available in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that, in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested up to the week 12/2020 included and 33 491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at a time, by grouping samples and not conducting screening only if the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: , i.e. "Oil of fire" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and may treat more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that the cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multi-xed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-manufacturer robot.
In March, insufficient reagent shortages and quantities became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to drive-tests and the purchase of a high-speed laboratory across the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different testing formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for the manufacture of kits sent to low-income countries without the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of the tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programs as the best way to slow down the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of rockets and chemical reagents have exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the U.S., the test kits developed by the CDCs were "failed".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but noticed that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will remove the kits that have given incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits in China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieve a positive result and the tracing of those who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, have yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of approximately 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people who had a positive result had no symptoms, and all of the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movements in the municipality, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has grown much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but the schools reopened at the end of the holiday on 23 March.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, had significantly lower lethality rates, probably because those countries were more able to detect individuals with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % Tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only the persons admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in per cent of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Washing hands, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at some "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
After changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after it has bitten or coughed/sneezed;
after affecting an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering drugs or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in infant mortality during births at home.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improving practices on hand hygiene could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by simple behavioural changes, such as soap-washing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate related to these diseases by almost 50%.
Actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing low-income regions with drinking water.
Washing your hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRA). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing by almost half the deaths due to diarrhea and by one-quarter the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures in water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could result in hand-level eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too often handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (mission, defecation), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treating a cut or injury, after it has sneezed, coughed or wetted, after it has affected animal waste or handled animal waste and after it has affected garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soapy hand cleaning is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 in 54 countries with regard to hand hygiene, 38.7% of average households washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that the highest rate was in Saudi Arabia (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%). Today, there are several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. It is possible, in particular, in developing countries, to propose that schoolchildren wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day in order to make this act a habit.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
The deforestation twice a year, associated with the daily washing of the hands with soap and the daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the skin.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soils, are difficult to soluble in the water.
An adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are riveted with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, with many strains of resistant organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that ordinary know-how was as effective as antibacterials for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and savoury water is more effective than cold and sandy water to eliminate natural oils containing dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water did not help reduce microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a hygiene product of non-aqueous hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly called hydro-alcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions for hand or hand disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thicker agent such as carbide (crylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the side effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on hands 1 minute after application.The disinfectants for hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or water solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and the nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than the use of hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid disposal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace an adequate handwash unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of alcohol solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than known and/or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis made them more attractive than washing hands with water and soap.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic material on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have presented long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, rather using ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the land or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands properly to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Weave a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
The soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
Fratter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and to fry longer remove more germs.
Rinse with plenty of running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands come back more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and a scaled nail polish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a cane or gourd suspended and pierced and/or using ash as needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tip-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crutch using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bread of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the wallpaper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with hot air, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the thumbs and 254% on the palms.
Dry-hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the 42% finger pulp and on 15% palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was cross-contamination potential with other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows out of the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and devices and eventually contaminating other users of the toilets and the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-aird hand dryer allows micro-organisms to be spreadable to a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand-dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
Following hand drying, the following variations in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different dry-hand manufacturers, and the hand-dryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands in the medical environment became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital personnel forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical washing of the hands shall last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands foam and rub.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since germs present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from re-contaminated to contact the surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("germs") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, many doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the field of health.
The draft Manual on Hand Hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website for feedback from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Available devices in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proved.
The World Health Organization defines “Five indications” for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (we know "medical" or "antimicrobial") provides the handwashing agent with action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To "frotter" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry their hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, it is necessary to prevent water from leaking to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, it is necessary to dry your hands using a sterile linen and to put on a surgical jacket.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after you have taken care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
Comparing handwashing with an ordinary soap to antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the first decreases bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores that are difficult to handle. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in handwashing, to make more alcohol-based products available to the patient and to provide written and verbal reminders on this matter.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are the most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health and even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal practice in hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash their hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
Nevertheless, the low rates of hand washing may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-cleaning and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, publicize the benefits of this practice and lead to a change in long-term behaviour within the population.
In order to achieve this, follow-up and evaluation activities are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting handwashing in schools, the example of UNICEF's three-star Approach can be cited, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be included in the campaigns to promote the hygiene of hands that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap-cleaning is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers who had recently been born or soldiers injured in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand-care: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" British.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid smells called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of the swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to a greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters depicting "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the sinks in the public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "handwashing" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It came from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in certain English communities.
In Macbeth's Shakespearean endeavours to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she committed and that she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, having remembered that they had committed acts contrary to ethics or had considered doing so, tended to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to handwashing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands put forward in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilate Yadayim) in Judaism, washbasin in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilets.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.
VOCID risk checks-19 at the workplace
The workplace risk controls of VOCID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of COVID 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID infection-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label, and maintenance of routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Jobs at risk of medium exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without VOCID-19 suspected or known but who may be infected due to ongoing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale environments.
The risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic measures for preventing infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protective equipment in the event of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19 as high risk of exposure, to a very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilating rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
Epidemics of VOCID-19 may have several effects at the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both with respect to the required goods and the means to acquire them (including the out-of-peak hours or the use of delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community risk factors, and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the necessary controls to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise following epidemics.
National or regional recommendations may be the subject of preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at the highest risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a framework that is generally used in health and safety at work to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, and they can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls shall designate changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected according to the risk for the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically carried out, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures for preventing the infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose to cough and sneez, providing handcuffs and dust, preparing for telework or working hours as necessary, dissuading workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they have had fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever or other medications that affect their symptoms. They also recommend that they apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of medium exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, at less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons with no VOCID-19 suspected or known but which may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to a community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread transmission of VOCID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high population density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at the highest risk include the installation of highly effective air-air filter filters, increased ventilation rates, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic-trans-trans-trans-trans-transparent plastics and high-volume-related environments. Technical controls for this group and those at the highest risk include the installation of highly effective air-air filter filters, increased ventilation rates, increased ventilation rates, increased ventilation rates, replacement of in-person meetings by virtual communications, setting up of cele-time working hours, interrupting non-essential travel to client service. Administrative controls for this group and those at the highest risk include the encouragement of sick workers to remain at home, replacement of meeting-in-person-in-in-person care facilities, setting-level working hours, interrupting of non-essential travel and non-essential travel to regions with epidemic epidemic epidemic epidemic epidemic epidemic epidemic epidemics, developing emergency communication plans, development of emergency health care for workers and provision of protection protection protection workers and provision for workers for workers and training and training for workers for workers of workers and training and training and training for workers in the need to be covered------- to be covered for the environment---- for the environment for the environment------------------ for the environment, the environment and the environment environment environment environment environment environment and the environment and the environment of the environment of the need to be covered to be covered for the environment for the environment and training for the need to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered for the environment and for the environment and for the environment of the environment of the environment for the environment and to be covered to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be covered------------------ for the environment and to be covered-------------------------- for the training and to be­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ for the training training training training for the environment of the environment and the need for the training of the need to be covered--- for the environment and the training training and to be covered for the environment and the need to be created to be covered for the need to be covered for the need to be­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ to be be be be be be be be­­­­­­­­ to the training and the training and the training and the environment and the training training training training training training training training training training training and the training and the training and the environment and the training and the work to be­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ to be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be in the training and in the training of the training and the training and the training and the work to be­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
Workers in this risk group rarely need respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from the other by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the patient and providing a mask of protection for the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose by means of flies when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall carry disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or with organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
The gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, the risk controls shall include the postponement of the journey in case of illness and the self-isolation and immediate information of the medical center if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For school and childcare facilities, CDCs recommend short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of the community spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate Community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choral education courses or canteen meals, by increasing the space between the offices, by staging arrival and exit hours, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate nurse for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement forces performing routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDCs.
The law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with suspected or confirmed VOCID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance officers, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a linen or spray cleaning house and follow the standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPEs as well as the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be members of high- or very high-risk categories of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling samples of patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
Aerosol procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchioscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs at high risk of exposure include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical checks of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when conducting procedures producing aerosols.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms according to the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, the OSH recommends respiratory masks for people who work less than 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-COV-2 infection and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 respiratory filtration masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by the screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, support or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial screen, blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a patient COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, the use of PPE necessary for the specific task only, continuous use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

DATE/EMPLOYMENT : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have toward each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to all of you to be among my colleagues.
Last week someone told me about his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this discussion, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a step back, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our objective of daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until new order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, run races or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or pay leave required: simply prevent your superior and help your team review the schedules and jobs of time to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department so that the T&amp;C will help you and ensure that your situation is given the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues on time.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth it if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can take the necessary steps.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
SRE Teams, HR Ops, Trust & Security & Fund Collection (among others) perform essential work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to catch up on lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to take extra hours to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new objectives and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning) ?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on critical work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines greatly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we confirm.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
However, in excess of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own protocol of due diligence which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and all staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who are accustomed to remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings at meetings by up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Making videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an email to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delays or changes in these objectives.
Next week, we will issue additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems both to be sad about the upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the future, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By now, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive issues, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as abandoning our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps that we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, provide our movement with the help it needs, and provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be here to wait for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to achieve this, which is why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, if you please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'The enzyme for converting angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of terminal N peptide and a renal amino acid carrier field C.
ACE2 is a single-passed membrane protein of type I, the enzyme active domain of which is exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is broken down from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane primarily from lung alveoli cells of type II, fat intestine enterocytes, artery and vein endothelial cells, and smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 ARN is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the cerebral trunk.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
ACE locks angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
The ACE2 in turn clarifies the carboxyl-finished amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack several other peptides including [de-Arg9]-bradykinine, apéline, neurotensin, dysnorphine A, and grréline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus originating in SARS) and SARS-COV-2 (the virus originating in COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 spelt S1 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and translocation both of the virus and of the enzyme in the endosomers within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of S protein by the serum host protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of TMPRSS2 is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help to fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended that standard treatment be continued using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is seen as innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour duration of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for people intolerant to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated as part of clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracking in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people ("contacts") who are likely to come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructure has been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracing the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracking of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicating with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking application of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed over the next few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand consider setting up applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geothermal application for patients diagnosed with VOCID-19 and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses application.
In response to concerns about the spread of lying or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists voiced concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass monitoring, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has gone away.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be 'legal, necessary and proportionate';
extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstratedly protected;
digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any data sharing with third parties should be defined in the law;
Protection against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The “significant participation” of all relevant stakeholders would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporting once Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the mechanism for tracing the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network mapping was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data have important privacy concerns.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, thus respecting privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system has been used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on the tracing of mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information available to the public, which was authorized as a result of the profound changes to the privacy protection laws of information after the MERS epidemic that affected this country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracting (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly appointed Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracting (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all matching data is made on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies originally based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide public.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, declaring that it would preserve privacy and partner Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to create official privacy-respecting coronavirus tracking applications for Governments
direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to resolve problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way after the remote threat.
Repositioning a drug (also called reorientation, reprofilation, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of an approved drug for a disease or for a medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is an area of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion of convalent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these liaison sites offers the realistic development project of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins in SARS-COV-2 include papaine-type protease, dependent ARN polymerase ARN, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is an antipaludean medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be one of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cômo, announced that the New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
Treatment was not approved by the clinical trial process of the FDA and is authorized under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctors indicated that they used this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Broader studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School performs a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan of 240 patients suffering from pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.

It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to reproduce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir antivirals and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by dealing with protease.
A team of researchers from Colorado University are trying to change these drugs to find a compound that would be related to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remedesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then found that remedesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several phyloviruses, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem of antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by the University Hospitals in Cleveland; one dealing with people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against platobo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The State of New York started testing on azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.

The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults over 40 years of age who have been diagnosed positive at COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and a study of the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a 2019 (COVID-19) hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease.
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many attempts to develop are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic occurred around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research in order to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the requirements of the ECI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of the main platform in phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates are in the first stages of development, including 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (in the course of planning or design).
A phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against platobo and carried out in several centers at all, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a lot of money to receive exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine," which prompted the German government's protest.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ARNm vaccine.
The BNT162 NRA vaccine candidate is currently in the preclinical test phase with the beginning of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparation Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a COVID-19 vaccine including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total investment of the ECI in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to 29 million dollars.
The other ECI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing animals of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million C for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $ 192 million C dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, asserting that "the sub-units of SARS-CoV-2 S1 administered by micro needles triggered an important response from the specific antibodies of the antigen [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Pharmacy School at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud-based IT resources.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized test in Australia plans to include 4 170 health professionals.
It is possible that vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there was no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that demonstrated both its safety and its efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines against MERS-COV infection.
In March 2020, a single MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines were in progress; all vaccines were viral, two were adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks broadcast a conspiracy theory that the virus at the origin of the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fever, cough and breathlessness.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases give rise to moderate symptoms, some change to viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people were cured. The virus spreads mainly during contact with the area, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses inverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on wearing the mask by the public in general vary, some authorities discourage their use, others recommend their use, and others that they be used.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for VOCID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop influenza symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, sweating.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less often, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or throat malaise can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
This is what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can last up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
The expectoration and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
Strong speech releases more droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing unprotected can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patients' chambers produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about seed propagation, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easy the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Precisely, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucone (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the beginning of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease home.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is a close relative to the original SARS-COV.
Pulmones are the most affected by COVID-19 because the virus reaches host cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme, which is the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions were reported in 12% of those admitted to the Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from VOCID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for the epithelial cells of the airways that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T cells have been associated with the recruitment of flammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with VOCID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses inverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization (CPR) reaction tests to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (possible to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first closest test of the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobed depole glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazi paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings to the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytary hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia in the course of healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IPVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding eye, nose or mouth touching with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hygiene of the hands after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face using a fabric in public places, in order to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacement and cancelling large groupings of people.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "plating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before they eat; and after they have bitten, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for commercial hands are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as moisturizer.
People are treated with support care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful in those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Reciprocating doctors and pneumologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen on the front line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in care conditions when procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals treating people suffering from VOCID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an isolation room suitable for airborne infection (IIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of individual protective equipment (IPR) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (on facial masks) are preferred.
Respiratory masks N95 are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (US).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for the uses not indicated.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or, as a last resort, handicraft masks.
The majority of cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is studied actively for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-speed nasal canal or positive pressure of dual-level airways.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to hold to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those older than 60 years, and especially those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of VOCID-19 to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that offer pressure control modes and a high PEEP are necessary to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The high PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are under clinical trial.
Remedesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug may be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in testing on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary plasma authorization to convalescent individuals as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contact" using surveillance data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel made it possible for security agencies to locate mobile phone data for suspected persons to have the coronavirus.
The aim of the measure was to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020 too, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera stated that he has been informed by mobile operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour week-end hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to affect people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have moderate development with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually return within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders, and heart, kidney and liver lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with ICDOC-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have a high level of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study of the National Commission on Health in China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological tests of post-mortem pulmonary samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high troponin rates or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-numbering of moderate cases may result in overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is under-estimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of VOCID-19 and presented a 2.4-fold higher risk of leaving in intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns also appeared in relation to long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong experienced a drop of 20% to 30% of respiratory capacity in some people who are cured of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether an earlier infection had effective long-term immunity in people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 cures followed by positive tests on the coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravate latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by propagation of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only led by a man-to-man transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, therapeutic options, time since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO affected the CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory deaths confirmed in SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 cases deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the death/world case ratio is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and not all deaths related to COVID-19 may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor evaluation.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher among humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest among 50-year-old men, the difference between men and women who only disappear at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The specific reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, the lower prevalence of smoking among women and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a less advanced age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with the COVID-19 type of infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nursing staff, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the 2019-nCov provisional disease names and 2019-nCOV acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as sinks and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup retroconceived and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and were rapidly disseminated online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-COV is used as SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, these researches focus on the S-particle protein that helps the virus infiltrate into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (dNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remedesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of VOCID-19 vaccines and medicines was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including remedesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remedesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with emedesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are under way in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some request an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation to discretion of physicians to treat patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for continued in vivo study after showing low-concentration inhibition of SARS-COV-2. Studies have shown that initial spiccule protein starting with serin 2 transmembrane protein (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-COV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is under phase 2 test unrandomized at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must prevent such developments that are suspected to be at the root of the death of some affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokine refractory booster syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment in 2017.
To this day, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of persons who have cured VOCID-19 to persons who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serums of convalescent persons, made up of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronaviruses, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at the central hospital in Wuhan, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
