Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that "they identify as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has taken root in the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "wold with Twp or Pwp."
For non-Gallese readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the assembly of the party Plaid Cymru has commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a conservative member of Wales has claimed that his group was "open" to the change of name, but he also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it has to be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for preparing the legal draft to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the Members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gives the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the Assembly, even though the committee was divided into "Members of the Galles parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received more extensive support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives; however, the attempt to achieve a consensus can lead to a complete curse on the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the weeks in question.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will hold a final vote on its name during the legislative debate.
The Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with the neighboring country Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the fact that its northern neighbour's name represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
President Macedonian Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of you."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he comments.
"The bars have already ceased to be that kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people were going periodically."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as long as what their leaders predict "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they do will be speeding up the closure of all churches, since it is entirely unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation there was originally formed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of street retailers 125th, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, which resisted to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's family members made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, described the carriage proudly as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who made the carriage ring in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also observed that it was the first reel in the world that was touched by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to be moved to the largest coach at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the secular leaders of the church and others by the episcopal dike.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote in the diocese last July expressing its concern that the dike "seek to pass costs" on to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the dike sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency from the dike.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving to find lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been spending half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says that first he thought it was about the joy of having picked up a lobster, but then he went "find he was screaming 'I'm bit!
I've been bitten!'
He had the whole clavicle torn," observed Hammel when he came to the boy.
"Because everyone gets out of the water, I yelled, 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel adds.
The boy was airborne to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was seriously admitted.
You don't know what kind of shark responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that I work a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed for 48 hours access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas because of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, towards the United Kingdom beauty products market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products passages in the style of the large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the United Kingdom's beauty products market, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors fall behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tested to expand to more stores next year if the proof becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is the product of supermarkets' greed to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims it will double its offer of beauty to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique make-up products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demand for younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's, and the first one did it last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open up to Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping over the Internet and changing the habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has caused large supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will become more and more like large warehouses in an attempt at the supermarket chain to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, plus a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch break sales and increase the profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt by the chain of supermarkets to relaunch their departments of beauty and pharmacy products resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's performed a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended quickly by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's from his 281 pharmaceutical business in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of products for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, says, "We have transformed the look of our beauty products corridors to improve the environment in front of our customers.
We've invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "crazy" after Holly Willoughby got behind an 11 million GBP deal
The Dragons' Den Peter Jones star left after Holly Willoughby's TV presenter got behind an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' life-style brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to do the joint home product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Peatrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star Den Peter Jones angered by withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative business life-style brand set to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "strong" when the red star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in his center of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new arrangements of the presenter, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltraw's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his Truly departure, Jones took a private plane in the direction of one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's main priority.
It was designed to be their long - term future and where we would see it for the next 20 to 30 years.
His decision to go back left no words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
There's a warehouse full of goods right now at their Marlow power station ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the large investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothes for the home, and the possibility of delays for their launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the president's office last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones also has 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be M&S's next brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't make any comments about his business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider "poor of a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking a news presenter's voice:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean high diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the first disarmament initiatives made by their country.
However, he observed, the United States continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions would have lost their lives.
And now we're maintaining this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile trials, helping to free hostages and return home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this fence full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd standing in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths from a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, the non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok had to be displaced, there was no declaration of any kind of national disaster, previously required to be able to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so that the situation is quite demanding," said Mrs. Subangu.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute in offering help.
Given the six-monthly suffering in Indonesia, the country remains unhindered for the anger of nature.
Although refuges have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even if there is a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is now heading towards Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his campaign the improvement of the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and he invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko faces the next year in the re-election filled with financial deficits.
Joko is also facing the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of street fights between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other blood weapons.
He observes: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of the plaza with a far-off jute in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from defeating the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at the minute 89 Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's port office when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The ball was accommodated to the left before leaving an incredible jute directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a big lift as it propeled into the right crest of the gate.
The pilot finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop her and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I made a move, and I didn't think much of it, I just dedicated myself to juggling."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at rest after scoring a goal at the 25th minute through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, Blue team leader came back from the heel a few minutes ago to Mateo Kovacic before he tore off from almost half-field and sprained towards the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
Then he made a magnificent step in the deep, which left Hazard in the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard passed the defense to finish at the second pole with a jut with his left leg where the porter of Liverpool Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples at the League of Champions' Group phase next Wednesday at 15:00 in St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europa League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami is 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rune of the collapsed buildings because of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, says the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the locals to have seen or heard anything about the crime in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement, "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would like to make a call also to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to pick up anything through the car's onboard camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead's body and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigations continue, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to the relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one has allowed him to enter or leave the building.
When she heard what had happened, she became speechless.
Residents are being warned to spend hours until they can get back in.
He could feel like a police officer told a man that the whole area was treated like the crime scene.
A woman appeared on the crying scene.
He keeps repeating "It's terrible!"
At 2 p.m., two police vans were in the area arranged for another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the agreed area controlling the floor block.
Any person who can have information that sends a message directly to @MerPolCC, calls 101 or anonymously contacts Crimestoppers via 0800 555 111 and comments on 247 of September 30.
The British parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite history"
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest way of the Taliban of so many of England's cultural and religious objects perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "intent to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster's palace would become one of the main goals.
The iconoclastia of the English civil wars was neither ordained nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the view of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy to be commemorated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a completely accurate representation remains a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid- 17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A murdered pig kills a Chinese farmer's death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and covered with blood near a pork court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a tent in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave a contiguous pig court.
In court, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic review confirmed that the 250-kg garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn apart and filled with blood," said the cousin, "Wu," as reported in Guiyang's evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin's property.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained closed and isolated to prevent anyone else from attacking, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at his Massachusetts farm, and left the man with severe wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "unchallenging."
"They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
You just have to respect them as they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves on the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring torrential rains all north of Mexico and south-west of the United States for the next few days.
The Rosa had 138 km/h winds, owned by a category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, east of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to develop in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, when Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity northward south-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave Monday up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate torrential rains generalized throughout the south-west during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause some precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the south-west, especially much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers will form, as the situation is rapidly worsening due to the dispersal character of tropical rains.
It is totally advisable to enter the desert on foot in front of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to turn into uncontrollable rivers, and storms could bring wind rattles and dust clouds to specific points.
The depression approaching will bring torrential rains at determined points on the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation over 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to lower waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall in the region.
There will begin to be tropical rain-insulated colds in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread towards the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
On October there will be several major temperature oscillations across the United States as Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain hot.
This phenomenon can sometimes lead to drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with heat in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the south to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities for above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to member of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, allegedly held in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political empire continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona Jeff Flake to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate committee on judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other chains that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Plus, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game or that of the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders that have clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most widely-hearing chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the one-day witness, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS achieved 3.1 million, the NBC 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was indicted by protesters when he was trying to get up to an elevator to see the Committee on Judicial Affairs.
Flake stayed for several minutes with his eyes dazzled while he was on live television on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it.'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in front of the committee.
In a few hours' time, all the cable and broadcast chains were already live broadcasting the moment the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote whether or not it was moving forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh in full of the Senate to put it to the vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nomination next week, condition demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to despise national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, where he claims that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should reap together taxes is "absolutely absurd."
Wayde Sims' shooting murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, 20-year-old basketball player on LSU's team.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison accused of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses at the crime scene and claimed that Simpson's DNA was found in them, reports CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After Simpson questioned, this guy admitted that Wayde was shot dead, according to the police.
Your bail is set at $350,000, according to the lawyer's report.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the state police operative group of fugitives from Louisiana State Police, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police, and the area's citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for his "diligence and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Half a mile, he was on the run and he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach commented that the team is "destructed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
The ashes swept by the volcano Popocatepetl have arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre was overseeing several attacks and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images on social media where a fine layer of ash is appreciated in car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have detected an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km south-east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has remained active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence confronted with riot police and thousands of people joined opposite protests to recall the first anniversary of the vote in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independents detained by the riot police began throwing eggs and powder painting, which led to the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, there were beatings with the police, who used their frays to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling for "Long Live in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries during protests, according to local sources.
Tensions did not decrease in this region of independentist mentality a year after October 1 was held a referendum considered illegal for Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opposites to the secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the polling stations throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independentist demonstration together with his wife, said he had no longer had much hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying for joy in being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he remarked.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although for a short time, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to keep up this year, since many of their main leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police on her phone, and said that the conflict was revived by politicians on both sides.
"The tension only increases," he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three 33, 34, and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car repeatedly invested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the same building.
It's also possible, at some point, someone fired a bullet at the car.
A Menga play gives Livingston 1 to 0 victory in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
Livingston, who this year had climbed the category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it's just the second defeat of Steven Gerard in 18 matches as coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, since with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second place, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's people, on the other hand, still don't win out of the Premiership this season, next Sunday, they'll face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers received this Thursday the Rapid Vienna in the League Europe.
The Livingston, meanwhile, widens to six parties his drinking indicted on the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take his chances in front of the visitor's direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the score long before the goal, since his direct game caused all sorts of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but missed his chance when he met in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to lie down to try to finish the past of Craig Halkett's head, who crossed the gate.
It was good for the locals to let the Rangers get close to their area, because they knew they could trouble visitors when they played in isolation.
And that's how this decisive goal came.
The referee whistled a lack against Rangers' interests and Livingston opened up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had mastered the possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a carrier Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the party,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop for credit.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor's porter stopped with his feet one time Scott Pittman and Lithgow turned away another combination game from Livingston.
The Rangers committed to hanging again and another ball in the Livingston area, only to be refused, and two criminal charges were claimed, one for a supposed entrance to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and the other by hand, they were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great performance for Livingston.
A man feels that they were excellent, and they continue to overcome all expectations in this ascending journey.
His style of play and the staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt by the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be looking after Menga throughout the game.
Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely haven't managed to keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcome the local defense), and this is what Rangers, who is on the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Greedy reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at repairing relations between NATO's two allies.
These had deteriorated because of issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU income.
Erdogan immediately moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police raised security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around them to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also felt as they condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both protests reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and titrated as a dictator for others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: A cyclist dies when he comes across a car
A cyclist turned out to be dead as a result of a car collision in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a powerfully trafficked area of Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The vehicle driver stopped and, although the paramedic services took care of the cyclist, he died in the car.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in a leaking crash in Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the nearest family members.
The street has been cut down and deviations have been applied to the bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured agents in an altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security penitentiary, according to the centre's office.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still persist.
Specialized "returned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, where eight prisoners were found involved.
The agents had to be attached to slight injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident produced at Long Martin Prison, which still remains.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We are not going to tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are sure that those responsible for this altercation will have to report to the police and they may have to spend even more time in the jail."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin's penitentiary, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had to be held in a hospital after being attacked by a criminal.
In addition, last October, riot squads took action in prison to solve a serious altercation in which center personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (dry areas could benefit)
It's not usual that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early in the coming week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national weather service has already issued river alerts for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and to approach it on Monday night with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained the storm or tropical depression state within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center range from 50 to 100 mm rain, with isolated points where they would register up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocket and the Grand Conca, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas out of risk from rivers, Rosa’s rain could become a great news story, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall may be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, over 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least from extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected that he will touch the land in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with considerable risk of rivers.
According toweather.com, "they expect 75 to 150 mm of total rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before reaching the Arizona border in the first hour of Tuesday morning with tropical power of depression, finally crossing the state of Arizona and arriving south of Utah well on Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what remains of her is very strong rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the South-west desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that the rains will cause hazardous rivers and waste streams to the deserts, and they will be affected by landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the Excelsior Terrace area of Middle Norton, around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was moved to the hospital, where he is "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two-aged 18 and a 20-year-old man was arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have made a call so anyone who can have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote for the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "pained the petty rage" of the Democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress Thursday, staunchly denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades, when both of them were teenagers.
Ford also made a public statement in connection with his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the juridical world of our time, a jurist with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizenship," he commented to the multitude of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the participation index of Republican voters in the election of half the term.
"We are five weeks from some of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually going," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as late as Friday, according to the CNN, a assistant of the Republican Party leaders has informed CNN.
Hundreds of deaths by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six metres hit the coast towards dusk, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement to Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency that appreciate the amount of shops and destroyed buildings, turned and sunk bridges and a water-enclosed mosque.
The mirrors continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake series were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "reputable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he comments, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were displaced.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase to the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donggala, nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came" by Donggala, says Nugroho.
There more than 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end far worse," she says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting on the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said that the waves came during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media fan, you can feel like a man on the upper floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water popped up on the edge of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a widespread cut in the power supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacs continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to make it to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Dosebah.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the devastating gesture of initiating relief efforts, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Auli Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross Indonesia.
"Once the government says "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start calling for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While staying the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place Friday, friends and relatives of missing persons kept hoping that the miracle and their loved ones would escape the devastating account of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child caught in a crevice was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding area, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages for WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means that the messages have not been received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic box in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy told the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM into the entertainment complex and preparing it for more money to be distributed.
While he was doing his job, another man "went running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper is renamed Ye
Raper Kanye West is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
In the 41st-year-old West, the motegen with the nickname Ye, used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before its appearance in the Saturnday Night Live program, in which it is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled his participation for "emotional reasons," according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West at the beginning of this year, as he was talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more like a reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, an old West collaborator, has taken advantage of his nickname with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is left for the country to fulfill the 50th anniversary of a cruel reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “the military force to suppress the Mexican people would never be used again.”
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when the student left school movements were rooting around Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should duplicate funds for AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence specialist and investor who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in AI, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in AI in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number 1 for innovation in AI in 2030.
"Duplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the United States and we want to be pioneers of the next progress in the AI field," Lee pointed out.
“Duplicating funding could double the opportunities that the US will take on the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the company Innovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that surpassed the U.S. Othello player with the best ranking and later exercised as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee positively valued previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robotic Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the following would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "China is not the one who takes academic leaders; it's the companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have contracted university eminencies to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the work of the United States in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors in AI," he added.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funds to academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other U.S. public agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China," Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial partners and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, DARPA announced a billion-dollar investment in an initiative called AI Next this month.
As far as the Foundation of Natural Sciences is concerned, it currently spends over 100 million USD a year on research in AI.
In the meantime, no measures have been applied for months in relation to US legislation that was intended to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that had existed with Greece for decades, which had blocked Macedonia's accession requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has banned it from entering NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents argued that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the people of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the required minimum participation of 50% will be achieved so that the referendum will be valid.
The question indicated in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU accession, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that was created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the defence of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski to the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the path of accession to the European Union and NATO to Struma, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents installed by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our head high, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that the integration of NATO will be accompanied by more than needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his card.
Zaev said that a "yes" would mean the "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% stated that he would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the pro-Western government policy since it took the month of May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after gnawing all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in the Manchester City victory goes for 2 to 0 in the contested party at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguaro scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
Argentinian frontman took a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left by speed between three defenses of the Brighton, dragging his foot through the playing field.
Then Aguaro was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He watered a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that he found Sterling.
The English leadman returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, which with his right leg beat Brighton's porter, Mathew Ryan, with a jute sticking inside the net on the right side.
"Aguero has trouble walking," Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told journalists.
"We decided it would be between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the struggle for the Premier League.
His goal came in the minute 29.
In that play, Agăro received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues front finished the ball on the inside of the net before getting out of the bottom line.
The City faces the Hoffenheim Tuesday in part of the Champions League group phase, at 18:55 a.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the fight for play-off, there wasn't much reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, looks forward to going out to the shuttle monticle on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play-off.
The Rockies secured a match with victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek their first title of division.
“We can at least go out and throw at the environment here in Denver, and know that the other team will probably fight every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would you want me to lose this game?"
Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer drop if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would open his 34th, did a warm-up session Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
The right-winger in Washington has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 stripes in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump does a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great, I don't introduce myself, but I really do, so I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible band of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see their pettyness, their ill will.
They don't care about who they hurt, who they need to go through to gain power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The democratic mission, he said, is "to resist and obstruct."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he cried out, and called out the Democrats "entrusted, mean, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which led to a strong public writing.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... that was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse party.
It's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, they are similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was reported that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions do not tolerate the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged acceptable to the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he had previously thought he was sharing a similar political vision expected me to turn 180o and take positions that he would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
As long as I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, central policies are denounced and I am told that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who each day face a stream of gender-based and racist attacks, and they don't break up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of "untrusted" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is becoming more stressed.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, not so expressive and "it would be all right."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, which left my whole class literally collapsed, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local advisor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is addressed not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr embassies lead the leadership
Two last-hour tests distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant party of the Lieutenant's Premiership day.
The Ayr, who are the only embroidered team of the ten, occupy the first position on the ranking table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it was able to make better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still bashing, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “Congratulations for the Ayr have taken advantage of times better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, placed before the Ayr, but a yellow card for the international Scottish Rory Hughes, handed over by the Warriors party, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle of it, scored and converted a test to put the 17-5 mark for the Ayr at rest.
But the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then, the party interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who retired in bed, and the Ayr raid resumed the distance with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
Next, the alternate captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an essay not converted by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card for making a plaque at Climo without a ball, from the sanctions lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-test after the penetrating Ayr mole.
Climo marked, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a David Armstrong jute and passed the ball to Gregor Henry's third line to score the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
The Still Game series star seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move to the hotel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, writing and co-protagonizing with Greg Hemphil, his comic couple for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craigang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on it, although a source from The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "flowering sector of restoration" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coast, expects the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their barge covered in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag attached.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazons are enamored with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering him is a duty."
Throughout the land without coast of Bolivia, the memory of a lost coastline in front of Chile in a conflict of raw resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the yearning to retrace the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia hopes for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, waits with a positive stance for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution in large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favour of Bolivia's claim that after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a polemic battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes deposited in Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts feel that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations organization based on the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territories and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final allegations are made, indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a fall in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the question of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has taken over any gesture of goodwill from Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep up conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "set an end to 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits," she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made at a Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when it seems that the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a chemera to think that the US's continued sanctions and objection to a statement that ends the Korean War can make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington is suspicious to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and the American President Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is generalised skepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion parades reveal the last range of large-scale hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the walkway a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which sparked the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram has been razed by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's leading piece was an exaggerated kiss hat, adorned with a broad wing, shaped in the shape of a feather, that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were windy syndromes, a witch hat and even a pine tree, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafoil masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of bright colors, had sewn lips and seemed more of Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another seemed like a frozen cone.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be placed in the main streets near you.
Big-sized hats climb the heels of the "Bomba", a straw hat, with a wide two-legged wing, which everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that spread over social networks brought another great creation to the walkway: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed with a bathrobe that wore it.
The dark orange bag, adorned with rafia locks and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection The SS19 Riviera of Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent Schools of Scotland maintain an academic excellence path that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), are striving to offer the highest level of service to students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for their career and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students studying foreign languages obtained the A Superior note.
Data, compiled from 74 SCIS schools, reflected that 72% of the students obtained an A superior qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Today, languages, as a choice assignment, are held in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) assignments in independent schools and in other places.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Competition Commission revealed that from the reasons employers gave for the fact that they had to cover vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are increasingly potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like that.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit.
So investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
There is diversity between schools in Scotland as far as languages are taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he'll always be able to choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which have staff teaching specialists in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what happens in the future.
In today's global trading environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
We have to do this.

LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
Hope is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday's first pre-tempo match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said at the Lakers’ official site.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After the early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers' pre-season games.
“I don’t need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to be ready,” he cried.
Trump Mines in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump scheduled meetings for the next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the High Court vacancy is on hold, Trump intends to secure support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing Congress's control when votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be seen online in the link that is specified below, via live video broadcast via YouTube.
Trump probably aborts this week's hearing with the candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the charges of sexual abuse he's facing, while the Senate's scheduled confirmation vote is kept waiting for a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this rally wave is to help the Republicans who are presented in the delicate November elections to get momentum.
So the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as long as we are heading for a season of swept campaign,” said a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbank Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters "of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won for over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the Western Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in polls.
"It's not a good signal for Morrisey that the president will come to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political officer at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep the hopes of individual Sunday games alive
After three unmatched sessions, the Saturday forsoms in the afternoon were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendulum of dynamic is a sport concept invented, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic on now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a little positive mood,” Jordan Spieth declared as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth's been lethal from tea to green and he's setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the 15th in the hole with a similar scream, which is like he believes the American team is still not out of the competition.
"You have to do your best and worry about your own party," Spieth said.
It's all that's left for these players now.
18 slots for fingerprinting.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple are four or four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the public bubbles, it is reaffirmed that they are players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun stands on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning forballs, who married Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to get out of.
Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the matches, the advice they give and the ones they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over and over.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a major advantage, but this forsome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and the forsoms of Saturday with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was not right in the morning fourballs and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance to the forsommers and won two matches, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair that wins four points in their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After slashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they called a brilliant performance to beat an uninflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius spores, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, remarried with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and dropped by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set Saturday a reference point for Americans getting two points.
They won a two-to-one victory against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later won Poulter and Rory McIllroy for four-three in the foursomes after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team had made a four-point difference to individual parties, although Furyk's team, champion, needs to tie it up to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a next Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm 'no way' if no signs of trust are appreciated
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any responses in consonance with the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally.”
While Ri took over the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as he gradually took action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of the whole, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization must first occur and increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "war-end declaration," Ri pointed out.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a graveyard of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that aiming at the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but he said that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there were no terms for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia maintain that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, declared Thursday to the UN Security Council that: “The application of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut the funding of Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making "a gangster's own demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in consonance".
He said that Kim had informed him that the "measures in consonance" he was looking for was the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Course on Rest Habits · Global Voices
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic observed that students at university number one in the world are often dismissed as to the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, the students are told the basic concepts about how good sound sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, stated that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, one hour long, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students need to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboos and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects the performance sport to lack sleep, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that students’ conduct will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a good sound of good quality for long enough should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in in the mode of inanition and makes the students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physics Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes the last year in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to perform a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disbanded team's 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house, which is another fallout outside.
Imbox's team was looking to add its first home victory from last February 4 to 1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerard in 18 matches as a coach to leave his team on the drift, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half part, and never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the score.
While the Rangers now fall into the sixth square, the Livingston climbs to the third position, behind the Hibernian for different goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, since the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the pleasure.
Gerard made eight changes to the alignment that the Ayr swept into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same eleven headlines that ripped off a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he was pleased by the way his team, well organized, suffocated their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers mastered possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored within two minutes of the party, when Menga's first intervention left Scotland Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the middle-fielder tried to divert and take advantage of the great occasion.
A relentless launch of Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow made only one detour at the back pole.
The Rangers were in control, but they seemed to have more hope than they had in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a criminal on the 15-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only directed two jutes to the first part, but Ibrox's first porter, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and the docier Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of Livi in the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he changed Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact, as the extreme took a break in Morelos, even though the imposter Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to get visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's gang could have given in the direction at the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a detour from the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton still demanded a final criminal for a quarrel with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes wide.
Almanac: the inventor of the counter Geiger
And now a page from Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as "geiger counter".
The counter Geiger, which is a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed physicists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "You're sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then reinject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then reinject it.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "encourages the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consists of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells as treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West branched on a pro-Trump diatre with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written to the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would present himself at the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people they say to me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee for allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it didn't go out, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It was unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the audience that it was not well treated in the backseat because of his hat.
"They threatened me in the backseats.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said he would put on the superman layer so they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do. "You want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments led to the public writing at least twice and the program team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that he had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The entire study was completely muted."
West was taken as a replacement for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the ex-boyfriend of whom, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West perplexed much of the audience with the interpretation of the song I Love it, bottled by Perrier.
West got the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: Thank you for distinguishing between the MULTITUTUDE."
But the presenter of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "who it is and who it is absolutely wonderful."
"But I've chosen not to reward someone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I think adopts and spread an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the raper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was previously called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince's music changed its name to a symbol and later the artist known as Prince.

The Throne Game Star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for representing the role of the Jon Snow Sword in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced virile hero stereotype, claiming that these papers imply that young boys often think they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine in The Sunday Times, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the throne game co-protagonist, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that he is quite determined to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can be a part of the responsibility for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its virile characters.
He added, "What is pregnant and what is acquired?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this face of virility?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there's no doubt something wrong with young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any throne game prequel or sequel when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he is full of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will be the protagonist of a reposition of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his partner Rose is the best thing that has given him Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character that Kit, Jon Snow, represents in the winning fantasy series of an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what was going on in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT group is common.
Considering the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many transmissions of disease are due to a lack of appropriate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three Republican senators on the Wikipedia websites of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were driven by criticism and far-right websites.
"Taxes, lies and more derogatory lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and telephone numbers of Senators from South Carolina Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and published it by an unknown person in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the Waters Office and that revealed information from a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
"This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which has been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this leak of information.
This unsubstantiated denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism online, including that of the press ex-secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the prosecution's motives.
You have to keep calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the critics accused of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the election of the middle-legislature, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure the criminals wake up," he continued, "and they'll be legally held accountable for all the actions they've done and hurt everyone in my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spike Paradia · Global Voices
It is already a tradition to search for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of Johnny English's fair-action comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is not an exception.
Is this humorous self-satisfying about how despicable we are going to be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent out eye and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to touch it all, his name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare pretensions of liquid glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson traveler who represented the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good moments on this last trip of JE.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the leaves of the propeller were hanging on his helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for the physical comedy, but humor seems quite soft and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" cinematographic marks like 007 and Impossible Mission now include the comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems destined for children rather than adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the dumb gags of the character Mr. Bean representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web site and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the dismay of the service agent, a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this horned character of Teresa-May, but the script does not get any more.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active spy is in danger, he will have to recover one from retirement.
And this includes the cursed Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but teaching off-the-job classes about how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his Dr. Bough's scarf, a paper that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a sub, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly in His Majesty's secret service come into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the technological billionaire charismatic who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madgeries: disguised as waiters, they burn a French fast-food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a childish program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English's other films, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pay the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers giving them a more party day.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The four-day shift to a week is supported by Trade Union Congress trade union confederation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party stated at The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits in the perspective of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker and in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Ministry's shadow plans also imply that water companies' shareholders might not recover the entire investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees at the joint ventures and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, which expect annual dividends to be taxed up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised the question as to whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I'm serious," said Kennedy.
"In the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when he went through and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined, and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would file an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it roundly," said Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I appoint will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which carries out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (whether anyone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that she has 12 years left to reach her goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand an action call or just one more case than we call "clickivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and comparable policies to more than $37,000, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10,000 has been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that at the moment the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, an investor association with it in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a few pages of history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "It'll be a long, hard way, sometimes we'll fall and fall.
But like the great civil rights movements and against previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the New York event this year, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports.
Washington can, "if necessary" travel to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including Middle East, has revealed the U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think why they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a self-defining non-profit group of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "unfair" gas pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, said Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the sector in Germany, FDI (Federation of German Industries), called on the US to move away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," declared Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said she's going to "restorately think" of her candidacy for the presidency by 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "stand still" her candidacy for the presidency after the election of half-legislature.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to hold high positions," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm quite worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that one of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not be introduced, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a wider support for the candidacy of ex-government Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile names among the Democrats that were taken into account in connection with a possible candidacy for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites TEPT Track Palin's affection at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after joining September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the audience at a Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other war veterans: "turn a little bit different, they become hardened, they ask again whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of arms under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented a friendly curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case claim that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but U.S. officials denied his asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require that asylum claims be awarded on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying immigrant entry is detrimental to the US economy, since it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Assault is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a specific political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of June 11 of this policy.
Asylum has never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, people face every day in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts at Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her feverish son in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Lack of drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take inundated possessions and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as the patients are treated outside because of the strong shakes that are repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassment with "advertising ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump went to China Daily's pay supplement on Wednesday at The Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-soldier newspaper, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, U.S., which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase in the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert commercial ads, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen the raising of oranges in mutual imports.
China's vengeful spiders at the beginning of the trade war aimed at punishing exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article on The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's doubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda announcements to our free press."
"In publicizing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert an announcement of payment to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the corner down here in Beijing, you will find few disparate voices and see no real reflection of the missing opinions that Chinese citizens can have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish," his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the election of half-legislature with the Kavanaugh disaster, they warn analysts
Since many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate at the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court, who faces various requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming elections of the middle-legislature.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have already officially shown that they want to step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last hour pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November approaching) as they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby while Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to continue the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Ms. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain outside the graph," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of women of suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote while they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his applications for sexual assault on the High Court candidate, analysts suggest that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the National Republican Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh sits in the defendant's bank. It's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats, on the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and the Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance that leans slightly toward the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the polls believe in a certain or probable way in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they believe in a certain or probable way Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or had been indisputable during his witness, while 30 percent said that he did.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating applications filed by Ford and, at least, by another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the High Court candidate taught him the genitals at a party while studying in Yale the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in a browser at the same time.
What is excluded from the personal online data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some staff developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that nobody on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether you need to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking permission."
In a Saturday publication at the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory
The only clergy in England who won a Cross Victory during World War I as a fighter were honoured in their home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann got the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons unearthed a memorial tombstone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's progeny.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran towards the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" he pushed the row forward before throwing himself on a single-handed cannon and leaving three members of the detachment astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never equal, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a real hero is shown by support that he will receive from many people.
The fans of the MMA who ran out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 and refuse to see the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 struggles, including six of the main card, and they had to see each other live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, the spectators from the United Kingdom were amazed when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had spent the night awake to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change for cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice-president of marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the carnet, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they'd be working on programming to include U.K. viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning of a Sunday and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday in our hour, Monday in yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages going and coming, and not all were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again for the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown to feel inferior to the other people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father was of paramount importance to winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off by illness.
Daley, who appeared like a shipwreck on Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he was socially unacceptable like children and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to let anyone down when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he was fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The threesome in the world explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, who met me in 2013, "I was taken by surprise."
Last year, Daley married an Oscar's winner, 20 bigger than him, but he says the age difference was never a problem.
According to him, when you pass by when you are young (she participated in her first Olympics when she was 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and bass.
The couple were parents in June of a child whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you'd asked me last year, all I needed was win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you," father, you won't be there to take the first row," he said.
"While he held his hand, he stopped breathing and was not until then, he was already dead, which I finally agreed he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small’s Proud), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and still put on his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson introduced himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday to play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy fit.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has usually been done for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments sets his time between making an cheerleader and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He has never made the drivers more direct, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where long rough usually punish detours.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday party, will face the precise British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood Rookie to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strong, Mickelson's party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role perfectly for that day, he slapped me on his back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"I have great confidence in myself.
It's a famous hall and it's brought a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we should move on.
He wants to be there, like any other."
Sunday, Mickelson is going to get past Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that hasn't matched its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 strokes, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to mock people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think the younger players also had fun getting in with him this week, which was fun to see.
He's bringing a lot closer to his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team headed by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the U.S. team, but in the end they won the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," Bjorn said, in the picture, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 Friday and yesterday, leaving the score on 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that are not yet over.
You have to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This isn't over until the points get to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are, the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf as hard as possible.
That's the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you let your partner and he must get out and also get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk, hopes his players will make it better individually than on a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the top of the last day, as he was part of Brookline's winning team before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but we want to start with a good foot, as was seen in Brookline and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rally against Rory McIllroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German army's new frigate should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not, at least, do so until the year after defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined Armada in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-buck missiles, as well as technology against furtive actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other features include longer periods of maintenance: New fritters may be used for up to two years without crossing national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the vanguard ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already reported last year, when the German army refused the ship and returned it to Dr. Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time that Armada returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why he has returned, but German media have cited various "material and technical defects" of the ship that made him unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, reducing its performance and limiting the Armada's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" will weigh twice as many class ships as the Germans used during World War II.
In addition to defective materials, the cost of the project, including crew training, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some surprising 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Armada "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer said that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but none were provided as replacements.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Armada.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new investigation carried out on a highland estate in Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that the discoveries will be able to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, in addition to ratpenate Northern Ears and Water at the Inverewe Botanic Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the United Kingdom National Health Service will also run mobile surveys with laptop detectors.
The analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which areas of habitat are more important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, just like the chemical paper used in building materials, as well as the attack of domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with proper training, carrying out surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, regular rescues.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the Three Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bat.
The estate administrator, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here in Three, we have a large area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good habitat.
But we still do not know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking whether there are bats before doing property maintenance tasks, since it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young women, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy the nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish bat conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "wanted to be famous" because of his name.
Your lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid $375.000 in his time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live in which it was directed to its 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five times winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to become famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers have already prepared the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have been described as "inadmissible information of suspicion about privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel suite and casino Palms de Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her anally, according to the reports filed in the Clark County Court, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%".
The documents maintain that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but they were consented.
Majorga also claims he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later he agreed to an agreement outside the courts because he was "poor of reprisals" and worried "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the agreement, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for the Royal Madrid coming from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he set for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always repent" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would always regret it," if you lost the state of world leader in the manufacture after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota's UK base had stated to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just in time" basis, with pieces arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border, which the sector considers could lead to delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day on Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and should stop production as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers' plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We have to come to an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The testing not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota could not confirm how long the production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsoovallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union at the plant, has stated that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The long-awaited meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "possess a week" while continuing the struggle over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and aid to Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether or not Trump fired the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House in rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump has stated that "I'd rather not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate judicial committee to which Kavanaugh was testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the whole Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not held an informational session of the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the TV news prank, although he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
He then implied that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources, "We have consulted this data."
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press tours with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, strange to the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service for fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it seems to be headed towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's convulsive time for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate my deep appreciation for the contribution of all the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU colleagues, and beyond, provide a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers reintroduction, has undergone an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury on Saturday in defeat for 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the bandline and collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a bed and taking him to do more testing.
A Tennessee State officer informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after staring at it from Illinois.
He had completed five plates on Saturday before leaving the party, which totaled 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Hisenda hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable habitats that would affect higher returns.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, increasing prices and making it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become phantom cities because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large buildings of keeping the prices of the properties fast buying land and not using it, and urged May to cancel the allowances on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive real estate reforms proposed, such as controls on rent and termination of "no blame" cancellations.
He also wants to give city halls more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be right if it's as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies with them abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on property is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it all more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach, Jack Ross, has claimed that his "maximum ambition" is to be the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, which currently occupies the third position on the League One, at three points by the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"He wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called to support once and that's all," Ross said to the BBC Scotland Sportssound program.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play very much in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always a thing that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland coaching include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Coach Alloa Athletic says he's not feeling the pressure to be next in a list of names consecrated to such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just consider I've succeeded here if I can get the club back."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts' technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid the descent into the third category and turned the St Mirren to fight for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting Alloa's position.
"I had always believed that training was what was best for me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably and enjoyed quite good times algid.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've ever felt since I was an adult."

The perfect time for a look is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has triggered consumption in the bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to the chain of restaurants.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but the consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA's financial advice, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the World, which has been longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the 2.8% increase in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, drinks sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the Oci analysts and hotel shop RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the external market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% annually would be especially detrimental, rather than the continuous pressure on costs.
This long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the trades that serve food and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much needed breathing."
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in the brand presentation.
The sales indicator of the sector The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the industry's established reference point.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers, according to data from a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary students indicated an increase in the "false Insta" pages.
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that they show to parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rapid increase in the "false" accounts of Insta, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a "principal" net account that they show to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to "violate me."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, of which half have admitted that they have private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voices of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as a non-executive director of the Scottish Atthlete Federation directive at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the country athlete and track with more medals from Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has respect for the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and all over the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very eager to act as the athletes' voice and I hope to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won the gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently the usual BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or how much.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's about to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
An announcement of tyrallets comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tyrallets company has divided their opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares suckling mothers with cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "silent first roll that can be brought from the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie has issued an announcement inspired by a musical video of joke to show the freedom that the new roll gives to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of rice and cows at the rate of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I do to myself, but you won't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not bluffs, but my breasts."
The round goes on: "Bomb, pump, feed the babies, fire, fire, feed the girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from the person who saw it, many of whom say it shows the "horrors" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to announce the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie strip is quietly hidden in a lacency bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Contently traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to announce a banner to mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out of place ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that finding the song was " fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the trigger made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for mothers to fire with tyrallets (usually at their place of work or at the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It's no announcement to praise or judge the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the stripper quietly in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like they are cows when using the gun.
However, the Elvie stripper is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly in a lacency bra, which gives women more freedom to move, hold babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first-born partner and developer, said: "Elvie's stripper is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
When we drew parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a stripper is used and the challenges that are meant to do so, while we demonstrated, in a entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new stripper.
It's not the first time that the Elvie gunman's on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the bridge for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children emigrants detained has increased even though monthly entries across the border have almost remained stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to adhere to.
Traditionally, most fathers were immigrants without papers, who were afraid to risk their possibility of staying in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that possible parents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs immigration and control officer, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to welcome minors not accompanied.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who have taken or live in the home of a person who has taken up are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people, ” Albence said.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to come to court in a month after being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in the presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children pass into custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports he has given to know the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of their size, signs indicating that a child is suffering will be ignored.
They have added that moving the children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that they already suffer.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has claimed that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
She said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and assist Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irraditional reasons" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone on the last great rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue the political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has a "clear time" and has expressed the hope that military action will be taken against the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front. linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, UN envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and preparing the way for elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, scandals and the removal process end with his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the end of a most dramatic presidency in history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of spectators in high-time audiences has more than doubled to 1.05 million in the CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million in the MGNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in high-time audiences, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", by the M.S.N.C.B.C., has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major night information.
"People have been seen leaving because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC "Designed Survivor" series, about a cabinet decree that becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered me because he made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike TV shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families could meet together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you're in the sixth hour to see a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 extrusion leather jacket ("a thick piece of clothing like his pride," titled the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'm not going to see Super Mario again.
"Part of what it seems like to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about changes in characters and scriptive turns of Trump's program (to fight with NFL, rent Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was alone outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but it was closed looking at the SNBC while recording the CNN.
It couldn't be disengaged, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

External money plunges the middle-legislature election races into the tightest House of Representatives
It's no surprise that there's a cash flood in the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the realignment of the Congressional Districts that has led two current members to compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment of Pittsburg suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the square in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of Republicans.
The New 17th District Race sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name in Pennsylvania after a victory set in a special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for support in China, but they withdraw them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of American diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for the "recent decisions on not to recognize Taiwan," declared Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman this month.
However, it was only possible to sanction El Salvador, which received US $140 million in aid in 2017, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high figures of death for murder and unemployment.
With the passage of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended up with any likelihood of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since the anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, from which there are numerous evidences on public records.
From what is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the organization, just when he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler only if the western bloc had resisted him and supported Checoslovacs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on bending points like this and accelerates or weakens the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing several areas of inflection.
What happens if Trump sacked Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the neck since this newspaper reported that last year she suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that it was inappropriate for the position.
Rosenstein claims that information from the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, are we going to vote in the middle of the legislature for Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we don't get over those trials, democracy will start to run into danger.
But I think we're not going to fail, because I've learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Satat candles on that table with swastika.
With this baggage, why shouldn't I be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, anti-Vienna Rapid Party optimist
The Rangers receives the Rapid of Vienna Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive four in the Vila-real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to rank in the G Group of the League of Europe.
An injury on the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season up to quarter 2-2 against Vila-real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Royal Village is a good team," said the player, 31 years old.
"We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else at the end, but, in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it'll be a hard game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll do everything we can and we'll get a good result with the support of the amateur.
Last year it was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all, leave it behind last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep for fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Approximately half of national surveys say they have talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent of the polls say he talked to the children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't dare to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and children about what you are doing. You cannot prepare your family to care for your needs if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: he can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care funding options can include a traditional long-term health insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the pace into the legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary power for your finances.
You need to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old family has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a plan written to be ready.
Finance is not the only factor that must be determined, but also which doctors want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with an air-compressed shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots from a compressed air rifle while he was coming home after night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen, and the hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in the British summer hours) as a "random act."
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is safe from injuries and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, according to the authorities.
Since communications are cut, relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala regime, an area in the north of Palu nearest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Donggala, on the Island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located on the extreme of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regiment that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the Island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific fire belt and earthquakes are often occurring there.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years are listed below:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 - magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 shook the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regime in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
Although there were no tsunamis this time, more than 100 people died in the affected area.
2018: A series of major earthquakes took place on the touristic island of Indonesia in Lombok, which killed 500 more people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Interim Detention Center, where he is held with an unsecured bond of USD 500, according to KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin's facing three class A failure, which means he could go to jail for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
It is also accused of a class B lack, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been registered.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the state of embryo in relation to the incident.
Her husband declared that he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian Island of Celebes Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake struck a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media is circulating videos at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack
New York federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people -- an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, on the Lower Manhattan and hit the pedestrians and cyclists during his journey in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to request the death penalty presented to the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a record of 22 missing charges including eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "significant planning and premeditation" and described the way Saipov acted as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," on the advice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern New York District brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police told the researchers that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be unfolded in his hospital room.
He's not guilty of the 22 false charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, rather than accept a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to order the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party's parliament says that it should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel pressure from Eurosceptics" when one of the members of Theresa May parliament suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MEP without charge Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when Conservatives in favour of the union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is fighting to preserve his Chequers commitment plan between Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave de Solihull that he wanted to break Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed as a member of the House of Lords and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he'd been in charge, we'd be out already,' he said.
The Wellingborough parliament member added, "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to break Chequers' engagement."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to remain is totally false."
Brexit Conservative Party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters: "I only call you, Prime Minister, to listen to people."
"Chequers' engagement is unpopular among the general public, opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win an election.
Quit Chequers' engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the rally politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops in this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, union supporters made a march for Birmingham before a two-hour rally was held in the city center.
A small number of activists rocked banners over the Conservatives against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis was laughing at Conservatives for security issues that had suffered from an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running as a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will examine the possibility of running as a presidential candidate after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presenting for his re-election in November against the representative of the state of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a focus of speculation on the possibility of delivering Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents in the open-ended meeting format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for death by Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the death of LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a head shot that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken to custody at the East Baton police department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reels per game.
Great Russia Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes before and let Hamilton run with traffic to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop boxing and step out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after certain wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third horner.
Max Verstappen started on the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round was in the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He continued to hold on to much of his career, keeping his wheels to save time, moving to Kimi Raikkonen, and moving on to the fourth position.
Finally he entered the boxes at the 44th round, but he couldn't raise the pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real lord to whom they told me to let me pass.
The team did a great job of having an egg- two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and liars."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing is happening in the Senate the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the leaks and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, will you filter it out?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document?" "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't leak it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't filter it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing her statement against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was proceeding from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"I asked him to be confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the High Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct improperly by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to seize for power and control," said the President, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat in the elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the tournament back 5 to 3 on Dundee Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two goal advantage thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the League elite for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this busy initial period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt made the equalizer easier at 15:16 a.m.
Dwyer assured the Giants' advantage in the first pause when he got the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after dying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area and there's a lot of people trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunanan General refused to leave his seat at the trembling airport control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Airport in Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later at the hospital.
A Air Navigation representative, Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"That broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the ruins and there are still many to which could not be accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six metres, devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and flights.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimarkets have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", reported the CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that was going to crash in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not found a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities reported Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane tied to the lake because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and that he suffered a slight wound to his head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who had been working nearby to improve a dock also helped in rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people on the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movement, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers the moment he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he lied, as his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis suppressed the text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be carried out by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio of hip-hop fills its music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, ensures that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put the conscious hip-hop back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Mainadera demands a couple for dismissal after a "racist" message
A New Yorker's nurse reported a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racists and compare the demand with a "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER BIG PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her pyfia, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding salary on her work day and was later sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple a compensation for the dismissal and asks for a compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month work for which they had contracted it, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they are racists by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable one, because they were afraid they couldn't trust her after he offended her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to a "extortion," said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a thing?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to get to someone's place that I first tied her up before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book, and also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "greedy," after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and notes that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically as when your son got something: you get proud, even if it's none of your business.
I think he considered the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he used to recognize Paddington's own credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When they landed, they brought their daughter in a hurry to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that he was very serious and they didn't expect him to overcome it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I'm calling from Nad and he told me he'd die in the next two minutes and he had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given him to keep his body beating were consuming and coming out of his system.
He had died before he had planned and so it all went off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep the right shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head sided and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her a lot."
Women of grief hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm continuously concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards because people know there are people who can come to, they can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost his partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he wasn't feeling well or that he was depressed or anything like it," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched deep on Christmas Day, when the children opened his gifts and he looked them in the eyes and nothing."
He said his death would be a great trauma to them, but they have to work for it: "Open a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future survives a thread as the FBI initiates an investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for (an investigation with limited scope and time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Your reticence has to do with the moment.
It's only five weeks away for mid-term elections on 6 November, if, as expected, Republicans don't get good results, they'll be weak to get the man who wants to be elected to the main court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI believes in his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the fourth and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters from North Korea "cau" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unity said there were 1,127 deserts last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices of human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
Usually, most deserters in the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul state that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, instead of refugees, and often returns by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-power-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a hysterical and not fit to work at the High Court.
The leader of the minority of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate at the Brett Kavanaugh High Court is a "historical" and that his temper is unable to work at the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that it's an "hysterical," Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to the Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excitedly denied the charges of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During her initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words as she spoke about her family and her years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's Democrats and said that the charges against him were "a grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelazi said that Kavanaugh’s witness showed that he could not work at the High Court, since he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintones and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when he was asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's choice, if confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, you're not only able to be in the High Court, but also in the court where it is now," Pelosi remarked.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Appeals Tribunal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, since she is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he questioned whether he would cancel certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's not time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and hope that it seems wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's justifiable diarrhea: months and years of abundant fury and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon.
He continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere that told me she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, to tell the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they're misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with mostly men, where I once ended up crying with an unspeakable rage, is that of a larger woman (a cold directive that had always terrified me a little) who took me from the neck and dragged me to the eye of the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well-mediated decision," he said as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "White and seven dwarfs."
Since he was late for the campaign, he was behind the fundraiser, promising that he would not join the race if he did not earn $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and seeking the voters, instead of doing so to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he ran out of words.
"You might have thought you had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"Are you going to cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were shocking and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distancing of countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climbing took place this week, with new spiders that affect products worth $200 billion, these oranges are taxing on half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has counter-attacked in the same way and has recently increased its spiders from five to ten percent to $60,000 million in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will go back in the near future.
Making Washington back means giving in to some demands, but publicly leaning in front of the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that were starting a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had planned," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"At present, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people in the country who need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime thanks any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that funded the insurgency.
The selection of Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup to defeat the US selection with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the shot out of the water into hole by 3 16, which gave victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of the four players who got 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was set aside with 5&4 for the less qualified player of the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of race.
"I don't often cry, but I can't avoid it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia excitedly after the European victory.
Pass the relief to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a career record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a time when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's something to take off your hat.
We've been defeated."
