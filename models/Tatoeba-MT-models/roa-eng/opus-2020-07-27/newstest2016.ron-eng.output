UN Chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that there is “no military solution” to the conflict that lasts almost five years and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present at the Council - Russia, China, England and France - on the margins of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls showing Donald Trump's real chances
Some tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance took place at Herman Cain's poll, but none of them won in any state in the race for nomination.
And the reasons why he would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are a few of the recent polls that suggest that the real estate model is not just a passing thing:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate model.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasmati" or "thank you" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 says they'd be "sung" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% says he would be "enthusiasms" compared to 40% that says the same thing about Trump).
Closer to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "unhappy" or "dissolve" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults brought and his bomb style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to the survey carried out on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We hold the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to the survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the personality needed to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents affirms that his temperament has nothing to look for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are familiar with the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, in the question who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July when four out of 10 were betting on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or repossessed to another candidate, Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted in early September at Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will benefit from the majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation one by one.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey carried out on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will ever change their mind.
46% claims that it leaves the door open to the possibility of changing its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently Ben Carson's neurosurgeon, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central topic of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the light of the mirrors, so will the Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
People are also mad at Washington authorities.
A survey carried out two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the benefit of the Republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unhappy" and 21% "aboveners".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long-awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely examined by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearance, he asked for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also said he could give up a few participations and hand them over to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in the leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech he held Tuesday at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent at the address of the national anthem in a job held Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew critics from conservative MPs and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem caught the attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "kept silent respectfully" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn Owen Smith said for the second's Newsnight broadcast by the BBC that he would have recommended to the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “indifference” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing through differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC, Robin Brant, says that the political differences are "communicating" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment as his position towards the European Union and its benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in opposition exclusively to government plans to reduce the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to address to Lord Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from repetitions and attacks, committing to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style he often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his pursuit.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics claim to become a cartoon and that it needs a profound reform.
"Fair in Joburg": Homeless young people benefit from photo courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could harm enlargement
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in minimum wage in Britain could mean "higher purchasing power in potential consumer pockets."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for labour within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "fortuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more praise and is not critical, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the gifted duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unpleasantly into the light of the reflections by the scandalous landing that Kyrgios had with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a qualifying craze game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have laid Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid on the ground."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place in person, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal of the Davis Cup against England.
"One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted a little to conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he mastered extremely well in rather provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unjustly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, hard-working and integrated into the team, had no conflict with the other players, he is highly respected in clothing, he is highly trained, he is in an excellent form, he is a very well-balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important remission match, which began on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long term in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the remission game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under public scrutiny and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not at the centre of attention to be able to reflect, the good thing for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has halved in national surveys
Former State Secretary Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place, 27% (up against 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't announced yet that he will be running for president, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
Fact of the survey carried out by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and the moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the 50-year-old democratic voters is evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
Yet Clinton is still in the best position among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level declare that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if he had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be excited about his choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed up among those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters declare that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third do not think he should run.
When asked about the second option for the party's representative, the democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half claim that Biden would be the second option, much ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden running at 30 points if it doesn't run.
55% of Democrat voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the greatest chance to win the general elections; but the figures have dropped from 78% since last month.
Biden is far from the second place, but the percentage according to which it is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to a candidate chosen, democratic voters prefer the problems in place of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these electors to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates do well in some key features of their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and reliable and strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three regarding integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden have the same ideologies as them.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
How questions persist with regard to the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, the majority of democratic voters are pleased with his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of the Americans are unhappy now with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided on this subject in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that the e-mail controversy did not affect their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they changed their opinion negatively.
In particular, Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they changed their view of Clinton in a negative sense.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be full and reliable, this aspect continues to raise its problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it to be integrity and trust, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of the voters do not consider it to be integrity and confidence.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are the first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrum to be greater than those who do not share the same view, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternal accused of killing the student in the year 1 of the Baruch College
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a start-up ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternal group of New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was tied to his eyes, put in his back a backpack of 14 kg full of sand, and was repeatedly brusked while trying to get to a target, on a frozen land.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Brother Pi Delta Psi didn't call the emergency number after he passed out and pretended he'd waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, to look for his symptoms on Google, and to contact Andy Meng, the president of the national fraternity, to ask for advice, said the chief of police, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal property and put the fraternity's good before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma on her head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by the fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of third grade.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged for outrage and complicit murder.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, official or unofficial, we will also bring it to responsibility," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
The Baruch faculty prohibited the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will collapse, the profitability of bonds will increase and the economy will enter recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is as long as it will happen and as long as it lasts.
In the economy, history gives little indication of time frame..
After first growth would interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time it begins to raise interest rates but on the time-life required for standardisation.
Indeed, in the game are multiple variables.
However, in the end, the players on the market could find that all the excitement related to the growth of the interest rate was overstated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that they seem to be all afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
In view of the market situation in recent months, the anticipation of the interest rate increase may make things volatile for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency that capital's profitability will be stagnating for 12-24 months after first growth, which reflects again the deficit in monetary policy," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of what will happen after Fed growth.
In fact, in the last 35 years, the market has grown suddenly - about 14 percent - towards the growth of the interest rate, quite invariable over the period of 250 days after (average climb of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the head of the Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle of interest rate and benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing interest rates often contribute to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
In particular, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question "if this time it is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been prepared all year round for an increase decision by Fed, all eyes being taken to the meeting of this week of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate at this meeting, short-term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period analyzed.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on obligations than on actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first growth/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of the bonds decreases immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategy is of the opinion that these growths in the interest rate will lead to the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-efficiency obligations are better done in such an environment, although we are still "precious about the strengthening of profitability," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed's expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the return curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed is pursuing policy.
In large lines, the companies that carry out their majority activity in the United States will have to gain as a result of the growth of the interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will have to suffer because the dollar increase will lead to the expense of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable within the next three months of an initial increase in the interest rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentual points), respectively 3 (percentual points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have earned from the growth of the dollar.
Those who save may also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "prosthetic"
He claims to be increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took BBC Music Awards to the eye, claiming they plagiarized Brits awards
Damien Collins' colleague attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show is original
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentman, putting pressure on the job to prove that he does something that commercial posts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public radio station "proste" is more and more similar to the commercial opponent.
"I feel like Radio 3 "proste" - although I don't like to use the word - but I think it's turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to my mind that only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in the matter of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anything about the classical music I've heard from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I believe it is also important to make a commitment to Radio 3 to discover new music and allocate new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, author Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British had less knowledge about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go on the tracks of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show purchased by BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be realized "in a specific manner BBC."
He added that he wants that Corporation to "find the golden egg chicken in his own ode" next time he launches a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the taking of new sessions in The Voice in the future or to spend the money going on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month the slowest growth has occurred from 2000 to the present.
Online sales took advantage of three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could lead to reticence on expenses.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the commercial streets of Britain into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the last figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total of the money spent in August showed the lowest growth from 2000 to the present year, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the last figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and return until 2000, there has always been a trend of rationalization over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales were up three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that you are stagnating a little, you may notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event taking place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers piled up in front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of many retail sites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers got beat up on chilipires, could determine the reticence of buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 per £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the fulfillment of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the collapse of the macaral in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked the streets of Muslims, the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly defeated the giant in Saudi Binladin Group construction for collapse.
The Minister of Health said that 394 people were injured following the collapse of the macaral.
At the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane crashing at Mecca's sea mosque.
Dressed in white, those who complained of their deaths joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death came to the end of the final journey at the Al-Moassiss cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after King Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also served 394 wounded.
At the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane crashing at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims were the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macarau collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have let the crane's arm rise when the crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency service did not provide the details, but stated that the company's leaders were prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and representatives of the group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and conducts major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son, disintegrated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in strong wind conditions and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the deceased relatives will receive one million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of converting credits into Swiss francs
On the banking market, two offers of conversion into lei of credits to Swiss francs have already appeared, with the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages can come in a few years, when the interest rate can lead to an increase in rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just concluded the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer to its customers.
According to the data compiled by FinZoom Financial Portal analysts, Bancpost offered three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with credit in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of risk commissions and customer administration was reduced, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, the amount of monthly payment equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of credit cover in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected by future franc growth and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which his salary is charged.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not re-assessed, no additional guarantees are required and no other proof of income.
Basically, there will not be a new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs as if it were a reinstatement.
Also, both banks offer discount to the monthly rate, compared to how much they paid their customers before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is formed more of the interest, and the client repays very little of the main.
Bankpost offering with very little interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all loans in the variable interest lei, is that the ROBOR index increases significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR every three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and within a few days of 2008 it had exceeded 40%!
In addition, it may also appear other costs, not mentioned in the original offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week believed that the decision would be taken, I think now that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be retained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, the recovery by bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Sees that have lost their charm
The actor (left) along with his son Redmond (right) has been going through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also alleged that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this is certainly costing.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is standing on the ground for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on his right foot in the Manchester United match in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eye and will keep him on the line for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the defense of PSV.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United while he was 18, encounters difficulties, then plays fantastic and now it's happening like that.
He's got his oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a punishment.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a fault and a red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for the messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, starting the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger.”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat of PSV
The British team's foundation has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France in June.
Phillip Cocou, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very ugly accident.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never aim to accident an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard because it didn't intend to hurt its opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the thing.
I couldn't help but see the ball heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's intervention.
In the SBS6 statement, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through such a thing.
I feel bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but it's still holding tight.
Victoria against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I saw the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't remove any variant of a victory in the movement.
Perhaps the team of Alastair Cook has less experience than three years ago but has good players on spins in the line of batting and collective morals is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive teenage attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England's team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his lead coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test games against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - players are their own voters.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The senior coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not as capable and does not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test games.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and on the move.
The only disappointment you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed occasion is the domain of the past.
On the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I'm making very well.
He's a cricket player who has "factor X" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up next to Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hit there and this left player has already shown that he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test 38 games as first drop before opening in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries ago and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he's a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age fracture - with an average of 31 in beating and 35 in the ball - and they could think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selections opted for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has made some changes to the training team as well.
Mahela Jayawardene's appointment, a Sri Lankan batsman, as the consultant for the test games could be a master's hit.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since he has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and reckless ambition.
I always thought she was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, she has an intuition.
Sometimes, the new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for a day's games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all of them agree, coaches and selectrs do not do the program.
And you have to retain, the jobs of the players depend on the results I get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Camp Brexit could have the cause if the economy remains at ease by 2017
On the day that passes, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly confused, even without Jeremy's "Yes or no" genius? Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticisms to Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past few days that - sunk in crises similar to those in the EU - not all of which are caused internally - some Member States are fuelled by the UK's agenda for concessions and changes to treaties, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC has decided that they do not want this either if it erodes social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend meetings or bilateral sessions in foreign capital, take a picture of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain with a perspective outside under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the very precautionary German Chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wishes to leave the position before her situation clatters, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing they do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how many captors can be Fleet Street and how sceptical are the barons of the oligarchic press that look at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in report 2:1.
He may recall Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a corpodent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-depositting bags, foreigners who were phone fraud and pseudo-domies holding most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair sees them about the same thing, but he realized that when you're locked up in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me back on Monday in Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC has left a Sunday vacation.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution indulgence.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the Conservatives' "angplicism" may agree with that.
This said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when his researcher struggled not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as minister "in the shadow" on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be unfair to Labour colleagues, without going too far and losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and to what J.C. colleagues and parliamentarians said at the private Monday night meeting.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - you keep it, it has made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the turn of social networks, a paranoia focus and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take the support of farmers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell's and Corbien's basic sophistication of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophistication - Tom Watson is unscrupulous about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything might be useless?
The U.S. are already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded to launch the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them connected to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in his report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the reference report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed out with their finger the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary base of fragility" that founded PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ put the questions under the sign of their claims and their foundation “on solid ground or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expected that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, only one meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multiple-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) model that summarised their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which the executive director was said to have received in the past funding from the British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarettes producer but not the financing that there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco producer Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which members of the panel were selected, but among them are some known "frentes" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even stated in the work of the industry financing.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for tobacco control expertise.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control unit in the PHE.
Research developed by the group “Muschamalizes convincingly” that they lack “solid evidence of the harmful effect that most of the products meet the criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE claims that “to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded to BMJ's claims in the past.
He said: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is lower compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of the information arising from and which does not arise from evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared with tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing the current evidence - i.e. that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Commercials that shame the arms trade of Great Britain
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
Drone terrible killers!
Bite to crush the ankles!
Dispersion bomb!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving any trace!
The cheery voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms trade is an open charade, made by Amnesty International to underline the desire of the British authorities to sell weapons of repressive regimes through Defence and Security International Equipment at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and in subways that need a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of weapons dealers will be thrown on the DLR Clients are asked to contribute to the stop of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound package of Allen's keys that states that "makes access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London Transportation Board is not amused by this vandalism as a steering wheel.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists increasingly ask questions and seek to make the political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are heading for collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that meets shuttles traveling by subway.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voice-doubled artist also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the arms trade - with an empty space in the exCel calendar - and thought "We're giving them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement, but "buking it with powerful animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair," said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, authorities in Britain would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the U.S. Army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped foci that gives amazing effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I can barely remember the strong smiles of those who are angry - and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things we've learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nerve to terror.
The word is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of study break, what you think about Corbyn, and why “in short, you are no matter where you are because, really, you guys, it’s nothing but the hahaha drug extract, you find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These encourage conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you didn't talk to even if the floodgates came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often abound with drinks, movie series and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and taste their underwear.

Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a wandering culture is built through dorms, based on friendship, socialization and friends that lasts all their lives.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want you to be friends, but I want you to go away to recover the energy I've consumed interacting with you."
Try to seize when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try sending an SMS instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who stood in the same house with me had a policy that if a door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you're starting college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to meet and take a black plate, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
Goodies prepared in the house are a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good chef.
Peanuts, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
The stealing of food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you scratch somebody's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put you in tea is all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If anyone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to deal with the problem more mature than my roommate, who has colored her milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
Now he's in jail.
Do not make noise that does not allow others to sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going right on the chip.
A girl on the level with me asked her neighbor to give music slower because it was 3 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give the music louder.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was nice and let her sleep two hours before giving the maximum to the music, locked the door and went to the exam that took three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/visitor wife would move on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be very strange if you were to confuse a roommate with your future husband, couple you, you would split up and you should meet each day and maybe even see him get rid of all the common friends?
Of course, you can't fight hearts - but if a sexy roommate is certainly not your husband's future, at least try to be rational.
The moment you realize that someone left their keys in the locked room, the line between farce and intimidation is more fine than it seems.
A successful farce is fun, but it can denture in a few moments.
You teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't attach the goods to someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a solist but also as the initiator of a less common project, he has the right to "city", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes her at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance, Sunday, where the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the first plan was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu were indisposed.
Both performances, performed on the scene of Athens, showed the audience another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble where there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for the musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they talk about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They're trained as "specialized musicians."
They even feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the fetishization of music focuses on the conductor.
And so, business, the music industry, they do marketing.
Therefore, we are not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public that can't listen, but they have to look, which is also stupid," considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way he does music came after the "musical deceptions" of his solist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who was supposed to do the same exercise in the entire world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I've never found any sense of going on this way.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did anything like that without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you're doing marketing with a collective of musicians where there's no ego?" the artist asked.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", specifying that none of the musicians that are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor was not proven to be a obstacle in the musical act: "In a curious way, the more complex the repertoire, the more simple it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal, adding that the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the world's largest orchestras singing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you have invited this strange group."
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal militates for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that "the task of music, as it is organized today, has a death line" and that "the future of music represents the music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it's useless.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who were working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organisation of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the launch of albums, they are all wonderful, extraordinary, but as long as they do in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity is suffering, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
In order to enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture arrive at the service of supermarkets, as it happens in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
The Dissonances make the reds may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them, they're the real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should go back to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans do, Chinese, Japanese - that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce its learning into school, we reintroduce concerts on TV and through this education we would no longer need to sell by-products of music," says Grimal.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that's everywhere, something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's completely different.
According to you, what's more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from passing this "soldier" status, passing on what "they think are their boundaries": "Musices discover in a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out of the fields".
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
David Grimal Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, the period when he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the School of Political Science in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.
David Grimal has an international solo violinist career, along which he has maintained regular concerts in the last 20 years on the main scenes of classical world music and with prestigious orchestras such as Paris Orchestras, Radio France's Russian National Orchestra, Lyon's National Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphonicer, New Japan Philharmonic, Opera Orchestra of Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Warsaw Symphony, under the leadership of directors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Frugos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian.

In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal had to explore more personal projects.
The freedom he offered to collaborate with Les Dissonances enabled him to develop his inner universe by adventure in reperators that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Other Season", a series of concerts given to the benefit and along with the homeless in the Saint-Leu church, in the heart of Paris.
Beginning in 2008, David Grimal was an Artist in the Resident at Opera in Dijon.
He teaches violin courses at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also took a lot of master's degree and was a member of the Paris Long-Thibaud International Competition in 2010.
She received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sang on a Stradivarius, "ex Roedierer" in 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by French warrior Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at the International George Enescu Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also climbed on the stage, this time with the violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the most challenging challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction "Craise of 3D Snow"
You have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who likes movies?
Give him the chance to get a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Micile Voci Mari", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If in classical drawings the focus was placed on approaching the voice of the actor specific to the animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story is taken into account and those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and cause parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They'll have a special experience because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"The kids will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between 11 September and 30 September, Cinema City organizes a preselection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio next to the professionals.
All parents need to do is access the smallvocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to sign up the kid for the contest and prepare him for voice test.
Later, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register by interpreting its own version of double.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the challenge: "Pene Yellow 3D", "Mune: Warden of the 3D Month", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Posnaș 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Craisea of 3D Snow", who will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecasts are down for 2016
FedEx stated disappointing results for the last quarter, the supply giant reducing the profit estimates for the whole year as a result of the low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
In the same time last year, FedEx announced that he will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in the pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the opening bell sound of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said he expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure of $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
The decreasing estimate is due to an average price increase of 4.9%, with an entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for land transport of large or large packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still waiting to increase its profits compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith said that "the sign is faced with a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular with regard to production and global trade."
The employment plans during the holidays were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The winnings per share were $2.42, with an average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit has grown by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the sum of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping leaped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operational revenues remained largely stagnant due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while the revenues recorded by the Freight Division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx’s shares fell to $3.85 or 2.5% at $150.15.
Tuesday was closed by 11% at year level and by 17% compared to the highest record recorded on 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in recent years, policymakers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Mahon Honduran meal to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank meeting hall, a mural painting of the United States will be arranged.
The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: maximising the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision that is too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced Tuesday, and will determine whether the US economy is ready to be disbursed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only one quarter percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait further," he said.
There is no consensus on the decision Fed will make, in itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of the recent Bloomberg economists have anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop in the stock market if Fed increased interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would take a long time to the next growth.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial media rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The asset was triggered by expectations that decision-makers Fed will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed were to raise the interest rate at the moment," Lonski said.
If Fed decision makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in interest rate would ease financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty associated with the moment Fed will act.
Just a month ago, Fed appeared to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowening monetary conditions that would confirm the force of US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite the high objections of liberals as if more economic progress were needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, growth in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to meet the annual objective of the central bank, decision-makers Fed said that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices falling sharply.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to enter the fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media dropped by 16% below the peak record reached in May, as investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would bring world growth down.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, the Dow index is now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For decision-makers Fed, the market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate rise time.
"Without what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more firm at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Imagin Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he expects they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and they have almost no data to rely on later developments in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of Fed's major interests, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
In reality, however, Fed became the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The President, Ben S. Bernanke, pointed out in 2013, that Fed could ‘stamp’ its monetary expansion, sparked an earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are being driven more and more, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of the Investnet Welfare Management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission for the Open Market, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rate, provided the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “in spite of the implications of limited identification for US development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to those falls.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the case of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate determination committee.
The last agitated period does not rise far up at that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into the situation of fear of an increase in interest rates because the markets have been upset,” said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until there is a change in this respect, I do not think that it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Channel to broadcast in Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the Liberal Party's leadership did not lead to a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine Channel transmitted from the capital after the defeat of Tony Abbott in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascada Niagara and Cancun.
This "cruzime" of distance did not seem to count too much for viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having a hearing of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today, there was a slight increase compared to the monthly (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were smaller than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference between 40,000 and 50,000.
For now, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current trend of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series having as its protagonist the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having as its subject a late widower father, who decided to move with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's hearing results resounded that "yes".
The X Factor Show transmitted by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking easy on the shows The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded backs and downs on the second night of the broadcast of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall of hearing recorded by Chase Australia the second night will give the Nine's silent trust that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Since President Vladimir Putin was openly provoked, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets at Nepal's protesters
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, said one official on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in Rupandeh district, about 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas after firing fire in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which they know they can kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The outbreak was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group stated that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic Tharus group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent strikes triggered on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said that the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange lines with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, security dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It is a shame for the 21st century Europe to apply 30s methods." said Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% cyclone probability south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide, low-pressure front at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Island presents a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, said the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the meteorologist from Miami.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for mild obesity diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in patients with mild obesity, type 2 diabetes may be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live more after weight loss surgery than those who undergo non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, because she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Throughout the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal within 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and individuals with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, scientists from Taiwan's General Min-Sheng Hospital used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and manchu gastrectomy - in medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes has remained close to the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes completely healed 36% and partially 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes completely healed only 1% and partially to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL "red" cholesterol "have generally been better in the surgical group", concluded the authors.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin level A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it remained about 8%.
However, this improved "glycaemic control" - reflected by improved haemoglobin levels A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the manchu gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%), and showed a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on high-weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery showed a probability of approximately 29% lower to die after 15 years compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit for patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it claims that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we encourage people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent an appeal to end the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring true peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response from the U.S. has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the September 11 events, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without appealing to violence.
I know his reasons were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested detergents in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. anti-poison centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Anti- Poison Center, cases of ingestion of the hand cleaner at children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-infection centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids drink deliberately detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube, movies can be watched showing adolescents how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouthwater with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (cleaning of hands) are perfumed.
Hand cleaners with strawberry flavor, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand cleaner contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-invasion center at Kansas University Hospital, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents in accessible places and if the young get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four hand-cleaning sprays with strawberry flavor, arrived at the emergency room to get treatment.
He had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah rumbled and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to him.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use wet products or napkins without alcohol and not leave the detergent at the children's disposal.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a detergent of hands containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York conspired to poison their teacher "bad" by "puting antibacterial products into class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the cleanser of hands and prohibited him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

Griffiths dismantles rumors related to misunderstandings
There have been rumors of disagreements at Celtic, demolished by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scots in the race for title bores Dutch - by Boer
Former Rangers midwayer and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic because they don't fight for title with Rangers.
De Boer, now Ambassador of Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands, I no longer transmit the summary of Celtic matches; why?”
Because it's not the Rangers there.
Here, we're not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
It's talking about Old Firm.
It's talking about both teams and there's going to be the interest.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and not just the Scots want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, I promise.
RONNY DEila agreed that Celtic was fighting against the resistance, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat of Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Delilah said, "Celtic had periods before and they'll come back."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtics because so also players get better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Prudence of Warburton for transfers from January
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that several targets for transfers from January, the head of the Rangers, Mark Warburton, is careful when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the unity of the Iberox team.
The former head of Brentford said: "The transfer period from January is very different from the summer period."
In the case of players transferred summer, there is the period before the season where they can be integrated, which you could have observed in this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that are not needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that it might be possible to withdraw from the expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts were driving with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red cardboard was then cancelled - the third red cardone cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tyncastle
The Invincible Hibee was picked up after acknowledging that he sang a song with offensive lyrics about the former player at Hearts, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tyncastle.
"It was Derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I don't have to say I'm not going back to Tyncastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still trust the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring back boys in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "murdering violence" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that Aberdeen's team has to grudgingly cling to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the punishment shot from Adam Rooney's first performance.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won something, in the cup or league, and has not won games like that.”
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
THE RATE OF SHOME in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in Britain, 5.5%, according to figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS)).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 74.0% in that quarter - over the average of 73.5 in Britain.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have observed improvements in the labour market in Scotland, employment rate with growth and the rate of unemployment.
Why I'm witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Over the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll watch a man's death sentence.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the Oklahoma Penitentiary's executing room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day nears for good, I dread the idea.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because requests usually exceed the number of places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved to press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, besides I developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried at her.
He admitted that "it could have been better," but he still felt that I was wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if he asked me to.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list any time.
However, he wishes to have an international report on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of media files that I've made.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to retreat from the race
Peter Moody said that Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy to his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they carry out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass by removing Lady Dad from the race because of a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the course and that it is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result for Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not want to look like "the fox that doesn't get to the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it's all blushing all of a sudden," Moody said.
It's known it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep quietly.
I want to head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to think that's not happening like this, I have to give up the job as a coach.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview for raking.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“Fifteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I will tell him if I am asked - offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, he considers me a cheater.
If so, then we should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and I know today.
Should I believe it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can it hold people out of line for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and give it away and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now might cause them to think about this variant.
But I've come to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
The frustration of the trainer grew with the lengthy investigation of cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved and the elimination led him to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unconquered Black Caviar champion, has labeled the day-to-day treatment of the race as "ridical" after a cataplasm with lemon or clay has been applied on the feet, which violates the rules.
Break the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees has misbehaved his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of cataplasm, for which the Stewarts have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the accident site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a crash with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the accident site.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being badly injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man handed himself over to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be charged with escaping from the scene of the accident, failing the first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers the opponents on the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the boarding tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" brought to the discussion by the top two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the referees allowed the players at Storm to “striking” the team in the winning Storm match in the final qualifying game played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a brief reference to Storm after his team win the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called that match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into the defense of his team's approach to plaque tactics and said the players were simply focused on "contact" when they boarded.
Bellamy says he got trust after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks we've really put our focus on contact in tastes and so we've changed the situation.
Trent is in this three-year function and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and there's been a shock to him.
We know how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "soul football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship by playing "multisitor" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he doesn't care as much as black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what I consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast-paced young people.
This kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of game - not any team has two middle players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a more sharp match linked to the score compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, haven't we seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more trials, that's exciting game?
Or is it exciting to pause and not mark?
They're plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have earned the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the next Saturday's preliminaries, at AAMI Park, making tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure the pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping and then authenticated in an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl then woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she slept.
He looked into the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
After the arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with children.
Hogg pretended he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "he pretended he was a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee court: “He said it’s an addiction - he’s dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he did his computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the images and the fact that he had asked that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “Then when the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than he did.
Last year, on 14 June, the 23-year-old Hogg, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the accusations that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March this year.
Defense counsel Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sex offenders because it can be said that this offence "has not involved a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before the appearance of other files.
He was put in the register of sex offenders before his sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the incorrect speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
It was not hurt, however, to film the fall has become viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by representatives of the opposition who claimed to have received anonymous death threats, threatening that he would not in any way evade Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was shunned during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Head of Parliamentary Group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gone, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but is called "dead," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It cautions Members concerned that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity no longer has value.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is " worried" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 supplies as part of the restructuring company's efforts and cost reduction in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide on the stock market into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from the corporate hardware and services growing.
The expected availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion as of quarter four, HP company said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO HP, who will lead the unit after breaking up.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will “focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is disbanded, subject to the activity of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley swing.
HP went through a massive reorganization to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest companies in the U.S. technology field, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus better in a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in 20-45-year-old men in the United Kingdom, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign against Unhappy Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to put under the sign of the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
The friendship is at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough of many friends “with a healthy mood”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, in order for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before contact with significance.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when he looks at football in comfortable armchairs and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be associated with this situation, even though they often make sure to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ...“my role in listening to people with tendency to commit suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who call us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying that you can handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you speak up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps objectively, externally, through the telephone, people arriving in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you are participating in this weekend at FriendsFest organised by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the filming platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee shop in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to impose itself in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
We present to you the chronicle of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the tournament of the Champions League, with a peaceful 2-0 victory against Malmo in the game played Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their goal-marked advantage by Cavani in the minute 61.
Reaching the A Group along with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only to qualify for optimum but also to improve the course towards final quarters in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect painting with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the chance of being empty after being replaced by the team in his home city and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win home or in the Champions League, so victory by 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference from the next class, even if there are aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season,” says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we didn't manage to give one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remittance obtained from Bordeaux in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light from the reflectors in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive middleman was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and showed this when he stepped to Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before kicking incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected PSG to win the victory by punching in their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defense of five and two middle defensive people, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's track that passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary and non-finalizing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries only in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, paying attention to him being the one that Di Maria sent into a deviant shot by Wiland over the gate in the minute 52.
The second goal was finally entered after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who signed the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic moved from Maxwell's center.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they will rebalance the score and just a superb stop of Wiland away for rejecting David Luiz kept the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi's new entry cancels a goal in prolongation.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with an over class and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Lower the hat for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by lowering stock prices on the commodity market, has raised $2.5 billion of the sale of shares as part of a vast debt reduction plan.
Glencore company, quoted on the London stock market, said it sold new 1.6 billion pounds to pay the debt.
After 57% of its market value has been lost this year, the company is taking toll with the falling prices on the commodity market because the decline in China's economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription law increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock market in Wednesday morning's transactions.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the broader plans to cover nearly a third of its debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than the closing price on Tuesday.
He took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern about the growth of the long-standing Chinese economy has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half and coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20-40%.
Xi insistently calls for wider global economic expansion
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy must open wider to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said, at the 16th Meeting of the Central Conduct Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting the opening and encouraging of reforms will bring a new embolden and vitality and bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative market access regulation list, the relaxation of customs control policies, the encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in resource allocation, ensuring a legislative-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers delegated to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and will provide them with better services," the statement stated.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and streamlining the application submission process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the right of lawyers to practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not content with the proposal of the Government to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the trade unions in Education have not reached any result, the government proposing a 10% increase in wages from 1 December with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or 20% in December.

Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in the territorial waters of Turkey after the boat in which they were shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP informs, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed to the Greek island of Kos.

Over 100 stewardeses fired because they were too fat
Air India's airline fired about 130 Stewarts and Stewardese for being overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say that the measure is "ridicola" and "sexist shock," says The Washington Post.
Mass concessions are the most recent of a ten-year fight between the company and the busiest stewardess.
The weight limit for them dates from the '80s, when Air India started using graphs with weight and height ideal.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardess considered "except for overweights", as it explained, "may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardes sued the company, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," then explains a company spokesman.

The "Paul Papp" Academy will function in Dej city, the local kids are waiting for a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy that I've come to this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented children who can play football without worrying about materials in training.
They have to take care of one: that of playing football the best.
Technical details must not be their concern.
They must value their talent.
This wants to do the 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he's with them," said Papp footballer for dejean.ro.
At the Academy of Star's Background are expected children up to 11 years of age.
The whole party wants to go to government.
The interim president of the PSD Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the Prime Minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision at the PSD Congress, everyone wants to go to government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a Congress decision, we will do so too.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There have not been any elements, voices in the party, party opinions to give to someone insecure to the government or to give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the seat of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
PSD announced when to make Congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, there is a clear message if the government wishes to continue or if the party decides to stand in opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce Monday if I'll run for an office at Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next month if you run for a leadership function at the future Congress.
I'll sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if it's the Congress's date.
"I will announce if I will run for a party leadership function," Dragnea said at the end of the Tuesday meeting of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
I'm wondering if the hesitation in the application's announcement is related to his file, Dragnea said he doesn't have this problem.
I don't have a problem you're referring to, but I think it's fair and honest with all my colleagues in the party to announce or not an application when the Congress's date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The great majority of the Social-Democrat branches proposed extraordinary Congress PSD on 11 October, and the exact date of Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

Simona Halep was facing a crucial decision for her career, she had to choose whether or not she would continue to work with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the novel only on major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the capricious sport.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or to give up collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.

In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last intersection Simona and Cahill will work together is the Campiones' Tour, in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he separated from the Romanian national team last fall.
The ex-selector testified that he did not agree with president FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and so he made the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary substantially to remain, but he was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the national right now.
Then it seemed bad, leaving a job behind.
That's when I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different media opinions about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
We went on to work, everything went very well, and he probably changed his ideas, too.
But I wanted to go.
If he wanted me to stay, I'd have offered them a contract bill.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros a year, then we have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminarys.
The Technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, and immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

The American Nick Hess was spoiled by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely keep his feet and his words were difficult to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, it was obvious he was drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe they drank by themselves, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage of him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize himself: "I looked into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubled up for a while, finally went with him to the nanny doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled of alcohol as well.
The moment that made Nick think the most of it was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a three-fold alcoholism over the legal line, even though one night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and without number investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewy syndrome".
Practically, the body or make all carbohydrates consume to ferment, turning into alcohol.

He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross

The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing damage enough for the car to be removed from use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, to the fun of the people who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came up when the dealer he bought the car didn't solve his problem, as he agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the Year in Progress", documents considered "to be still a stage in Romania's efforts to modernise the immigration management process in the national territory", according to a press release.
The above-mentioned source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies at European level adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems facing the States of the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are being taken to manage the unitary and consistent situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants in Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military nature.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or which may affect national security," adds the recalled source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the neighbouring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and growing in intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous checks on the legality of the headquarters of third-country nationals in Romania and the corresponding application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania of third-party citizens who meet the needs of employment, favouring the access of third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for the areas and professions identified as deficit.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciated that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the migration phenomenon growing".

Activity report of the TVR driver, rejected in commissions: Stelian Tanase risks resignation
Parliament's Culture Committees rejected the 2014 work report of the Romanian Television Society Board of Directors on Wednesday.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be discussed.
"I believe that in view of this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the Chairman of the Committee on Culture at the Senate, Georgica Severin.
He added that it was "good sense" that TVR leadership was present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the Committees of Culture.
It felt good to be in charge of TVR because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to CA members just last night, an approximate hour that we didn't know the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to TVR management inviting her.
I think the moment you're summoned, you're being paid from public taxes, and you're summoned to a meeting of the committees meeting even if you don't like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the Committees meeting in Parliament's culture.
He added that at the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees.
The debts we saw how they went on, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
"I will remind you that not of my fault or anyone else in these committees has lost that pleasure with banks and with the tax, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the plenary meeting will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will choose the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonderful things won't happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man I'm lying to you, to tell you that a genius will show up who's gonna stand at the tail here and beat up.
I hope that those who decide, the whole of Parliament, by their vote, will choose the people who will lead the TVR with a great deal of reason.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities it has to have -- good sense of attitude toward employees because it's a curse of small people who come from employees, complaints, redundancies.
"When you get such sessions 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," the president of the Committee on Culture in the Senate concluded.
Although it did not appear in Parliament, the President-General of the TVR, Stelian Tanse, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valerius Zgonea, in which he asked that his Parliament consider a number of measures which could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the economic and political independence of the public television, including the numbering and indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the amendment and addition of HG 978/2003 on the fee for public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions on the level of technological changes to the day, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on the control of the payment of TV and the finding of contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He would also like to issue a provision that would provide for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s agents for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of up to 5% of the commission in cash.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of VAT for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to 3%, and also the amendment of the Law 41/1994, to the possibility of receiving the budget/funding allocation for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Gold Cerbula, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months in view of the fact that labour law obliges the employer to execute judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and salary rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and TV production.
"Then the travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," was shown in the letter from TVR president.
So much so that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be found, sooner or later, in the inability to fulfil its public mission", is mentioned in the letter.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, sued
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Park near the Bucharest Appeal Court.
It is charged with tax evasion, in a file with damage of approximately 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
He set up the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation showed that, for the purpose of subtracting taxes and taxes from the state budget, representatives of a company specialising in security services would have created an infringement circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictional transactions would have been made evident.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have been recorded for the fictitious purchase of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," explained the Roman Police in a press release.
The Seici have established Sanmartean's fate
The Al-Ittihad Club has established the fate of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, entrepreneur Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game title and does it well.
The Seici have also realized that he is the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
There would have been a chance to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, like that with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been accomplished," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Elie Sarbu was voted vice president at the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint Prime Minister Victor Ponta's father, PSD Ilie Sarbu, as vice president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 "for" and 108 "in contrast" votes were recorded.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24.
Moreover, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this function and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, under the conditions that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors doesn't allow him to do politics anymore.
Senator PSD will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, free tender after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a cook in the movie "Burnt", the actor made an assessment that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I've worked most of my life as a cook."
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since 15 years, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, relates ContactMusic.
I wondered what plans he had in the future at that time, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the type of man to plan for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating at all for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh about if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was accomplished.
At the age of 40, the actor recognized that he saw himself in the near future directed, taking the pattern of Clint Eastwood, who went to rule this entire age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned harsh, Wednesday morning, the claims of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to whose political decisions in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries fleeing refugees".
" Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational claims, his entire Hungarian offender," the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs transmitted to a statement.
European civilized politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in Romania's domestic policy," added Hungarian diplomacy chief, according to MTI.
In a post on Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that he wants to attract attention and sanction the conduct of high Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to meet the challenges of Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is a member of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The shambles, aggressive laws, jails and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries that run away from those refugees!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and above all in European values - which we see in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with just these objectives and values!" the head of the Roman executive underlined.
Previously on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of the refugee crisis by Hungary, appreciating that these claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The chief of Hungarian diplomacy also referred to Tuesday as the "extreme and lying marks" of the Roman Prime Minister of Romania's internal political crisis and stated that Budapest expects an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all who come are terrorists, are fools of the Middle Ages and totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with bata and with the insertion.
"That's what I don't agree with," the Roman chief executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government had decided to start preparations in the field for extending to Romania the border fence he built with Serbia, to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Subsequently, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence did not solve any of the refugee problems and "take Hungary from Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the macaral at Mecca?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday, on the Great Mosque of Mecca, an accident following the death of 107 people.
According to a committee of inquiry, the company did not "respect the safety rules", the Saudi media agency (SPA) reported BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of the former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of Big Mosque, to be able to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the aesthetic side of the Big Mosque roof at Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut up the contestants
Considered by many world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after the withdrawal from the activity, as a weak coach, who can't be able to achieve performance in the new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year later, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he is patronizing.
After fixing a year from the team's takeover, the King has shown that he is able to transform a team that was struggling to save from retrogradation into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 losers.
The swing is one of a top team, fighting at the European Cups.
Things took a turn and better for the future this season, instructed the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader of Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equivalent to Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even if it brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the starting team names such as Yanis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared.
The club's policy has made from the Future a team to track foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros (Ianis Hagi) this summer and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with the Star, the Future is the only lucrative team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's 7th country.
Large countries come with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the College of Directors of the Roman Center of European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we may have doubts about the quality of the values these people are coming with".
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we were at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians felt the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up their freedom of movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in JAI and any State may block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16 representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions even appeared in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and they didn't want many countries to appear as an "EU-like reaction sends migrants on our heads".
They have thus argued, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably see big changes there in the following period.
So the mandatory odds weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to shave?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be abandoned, according to which migrants are responsible for the first-time state, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capsizes, you can't say infinitely what it's like for Greece.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a precise, perhaps mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they get to them.
Because there's still a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will take over the migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach some unique filtering centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenoob power.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precaution camps and who have just started to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have come to leave, winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we're waiting for next year at a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it so medialy.
You were talking about countries with smaller or larger experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where it has really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-European culture?
I'm looking at the Magrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're all enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but that doesn't mean it's not integrated at all.
There is still an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But even cops won't work.
To create the fortress of Europe is illusory.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be covered.
There were some mistakes.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn their language, to try to take the values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family including by marriage mates of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people's long-term problems of their integration must be separated.
If others have failed to integrate in the long term, it does not mean that we need to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of these people's values.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that it's going to make the country all night and you can take it back.
Until the solutions are protected, we see fortresses within Europe.
The borders have been closed, the walls are lifted, the border controls are re-introduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries in which I set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're going around free, but each one's in his own problems.
In front of such a wave it can't be so, because some countries don't face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they do something, but in the long run there is no big change.
After the attacks in France, we do not have a much more dramatic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public excitement that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under the pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion is getting excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for humans but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There's gonna be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted for the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks that if she pulls the bag over her eyes and she steals her ears, the theme disappears.
In front of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
We did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's 7th country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Great countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will greatly diminish.
President Iohannis says it's possible that I'm not already in.
So we move from despair to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that it's a reason we don't enter Schengen anymore, but let's be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of the Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, they will be unique rules for the acceptance of migrants, the single rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the single rules for countries deemed to be safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved Syria's attention to Ukraine no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two focusses, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it's great power to mess with Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before the main or opponent to be the Islamic state.
About two years was a battle between the Assad regime and the secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but can't participate in the solution.
She creates seals of instability and chaos that she cannot close.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe a little waits for him to make offers, push him on buttons to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve in one way or another issues created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see the little stronger than it is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become familiar with the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social networking network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, informs New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg has specified that the "Dislike" button will look more like a nuance of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give Dislike.
The network users, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the possibility to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving that mail to Like," said Facebook representative.
The appearance of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social networks," Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted with this topic.
"I'll give Diskike to the 'Dislike' button," this said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, one of the thousands of mass arrivals at its southern border with Serbia, announced Government counseling Gyorgy Bacondi.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two-judgments along the border with Serbia due to the refugee flow, closing a major border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also patrolled Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council is falling.
Two manufacturers, insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, are being blamed on the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The County Council of Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up giving up on its own.
A year and a half after work on building consolidation and refunction had been completed, the work had not even reached half.
A final stage in the building era was consumed the last few days when the National Context Resolution Board (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that was seeking to take over the contract for the completion of the technical project for the further works to be carried out.
The original project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, with the company to update the technical project and then a new tender for works being organised.
"The negotiations did not, however, end with a contract, considering that the proposed form would have disadvantageed the institution," said Răzvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to halt direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to the CNSC, who rejected it as late.
This does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Appeal Court, only after a final sentence of it can be taken into account to find another designer.
Thus, work on building consolidation could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the renovation of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We wait to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofcic said.
The consolidation work of the former Police Headquarters started in 2011.
A first contract of work was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed, with the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency and this contract was terminated after 1.5 million lei had been paid.
The work has been done so far in proportion to about 50%.
Initially, work on consolidation, refunction and mansarding of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I'm saying!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastrum
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record of the Cadastru Office signed an agreement for recognition of the facts against a delaying prison.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the others accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Office of Registers and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a file of corruption acknowledged his fap tele.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Destălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Daniel Destălu was charged with continued intellectual falsification and agreed to perform two years of imprisonment with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As for the facts attributed to Destălu, the prosecutors have specified that he, as an adviser to the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, "has drawn up in false several verbatim acceptance processes, for the sale of service contracts in the previous key by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the directors of the companies SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC The Agency as Dastru and Topographies SRL and PFA Lipșa Stefan, which fail to attest, in any case, that the contracted services have been carried out entirely, under conditions in which they were not performed and were not filed at O.C.P.I. Iasi".
In the past days, the former Head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OPCW were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to those firms, although the works were not carried out.
Prejudice is over 300,000 lei.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's handball national for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, in a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that it must go through two stages of fork-chain, first World Championship and secondly the prequalification tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two men, porter coach, physical preparer, head of delegation.
They asked us to qualify for some things, more precisely materials for physical training, which I have never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money, a lot of money.
But that's the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the rock era with preparation.
"The teams we are fighting with have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is embarrassing to be put under the sign of a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within a period of two years.
Before 1992, the present Olympic area in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were successful and from the point of view of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring forward major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but they quickly became clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize, and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new room in Bucharest, and then we discussed concrete.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," explained FRH official.
The former big handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to arrive in Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in prognostics, that if they don't carry out they turn against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbişi debuts on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team Mihai Macovei said Tuesday at a press conference that all Romanian Lot's components are prepared for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We're ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four matches.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup, it's the celebration of all these years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come with beautiful results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, represent with pride the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's National Team Selector Lynn Howells, who is first experienced as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that every match make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last few years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's 18-19-year-old teams, so there's cohesion, there's a band of friends who's set to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, with the following scheduled matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England-Fiji game in Group A.

14 million lei give the Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" of Iași to correct the budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
St. Spiridon's hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary correction, approximately 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and repair of clinics, but also in medical equipment and techniques for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six ATI beds equipped with correspondingly, ophthalmogenic microscope and other devices necessary to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the hospital's money will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Mare Ars".
From the money from the budgetary correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will be receiving work from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure decent transport of the patient from UPU to neighboring clinics," the health unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in the Ageași, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area of allergy, hematology and endocrinology in the outpatient ward and will have about 30 beds.
Iash, made laugh by RATP controllers and a folder.
The Land of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife, we never want to climb again in your city.
Without wishing to do so, they hit the wrong information from the flyers, the lack of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist rides.
They also received a folder where RATP tracks were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited Iashul.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Mall Palace.
Because it wasn't a ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they based on the printed information on the fold: that I can take the note via SMS.
No one told them that this service is gone.
Trusted folders, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the folder.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there was no longer a two-year service and they announced in the press that they had cancelled.
Do I know where it was written in the local press, I came one night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they don't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (me and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spoil my day of visiting stand at the gendarmerie and giving the statements there!" Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the erroneous information on the fold and the controllers who "implemented the law on blood".
It's not fair, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the point is I felt wrong.
Ghinion for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial detention
The trial of seven rapists from Vaslui moved to the Iasi Court yesterday.
The judges of the Jews tried the first term of judgment at an unpublic meeting where the seven young accused of mocking a young 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the actual commencement of the trial session, one of the judges of the country whose file, Viorel Munteanu, had been allocated, made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until the summer of this year at the Vasului Court, where he was president of the Pelle Section, he who, on 9 April, admitted a contest made by four of the defendants, having them placed in custody at home.
Currently, the file is tried by a complete one of which are part of Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he formulated an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter is in a cohabitation relationship with one of the lawyers of rapists.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui continued to remain in pre-trial detention.
The blacks will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when the judges re-release the possibility of their release.
The next term of judgment will be held at the Iasi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in Păcurari neighborhood, the car entering Iași on the belt.
The Iveco utility with which the seven rapists were carrying hit a Volks Wagen autotourism that came out of the street of Canta, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van is circulating at the end of the past.
The car entered Iași this way because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iași on the Gardens, then on the belt road.
They shorten the road a few miles.
Immediately after impact, the arrest escort called for another transport to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the Prisoner of Maxima Security Iasi, who took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the wheels, and the arresters came out at a speed, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police because drivers of the two motor vehicles have been well understood as regards the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Medalin Tăranu, IPJ.
Great migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what follows.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and sharp: the not 7000 refugees that should and should naturalize Romania represent in themselves an insignificant number, but huge compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitated by interlocutors and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state is impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate them into the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent health care, gather the mess on the street, create honorable paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees be established in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what brings much wonder is in particular the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent faction of the strong states of the EU, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearless hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - from another language, from another religion, from another blood.
Probably afraid he won't steal anyone's national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Or, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be reversed.
It is necessary to eliminate the causes, support some and, by strictly placing on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylated, disassembled and over-the-counter construction.
I was complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that the EU does not have a future plan either.
And improvisations and threats don't help.
What, then, is the EU using, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrants' crisis, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what it will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practically imposed
The concessional tender shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of imprisonment, the Romanian Literary Museum court club is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 m, on two levels of humbes.
CJ accepts as destinations the building only those of literary cafe, library or other activities with cultural profile.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the tender starting value of 6,830 euros per year, with a tendering step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and continuously operate the building and fully cover the costs of the rehabilitation of the building in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in a state of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which the public power plant was operated and no further evacuation of the plant, there has been no current repair and maintenance work as is commonly required during the operation of a building", is mentioned in the tendering procedure documentation.
The club's concession offers are expected by 18 September.
Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother had a treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were taken as an emergency to the "Holy Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age, she received a brave gift: the biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear conditions, in the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by an educated family from Italy, in the same years in which the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again in Iasi with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be doing her 20 years ago, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iasi, to get to know her undisclosed past.
"The Iasi Day", which has assisted in the search of the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, has witnessed these meetings that have practically broken your heart.
The report of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and overwhelming.
The story of the Crina began 20 years ago in the western town of Ruginosa, when it was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital in the city.
Home there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away from home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the Pascani municipal hospital, and still the daughter's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be separated permanently.
They never found Crina in the hospital again.
After admission, Crina's father left for work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the Iasi hospital, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"He thought she was abandoned," tells a niece of the family.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the fate of the child all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more light-regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple in Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the Crina blonde, and after some time this had to move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already made almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given him life," he tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he catches up with his fictitious hand of the girl.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities of Ruginosa, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then sent her that she might be dead, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the court that she was gone to Italy to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her have never been.
We prayed to God to be well.
I thought about it all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find it.
"It's hard," he tells us with tears in her biological mother's eyes.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, the Romanian Chief Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Anti-Drug Iasi, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And search only started from one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first steps.
I just got a name, the Costic Balkans, then the town, the Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there's a local name received.
Then they gave me some clues, except the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It lasted about a month before we found the girl's biological father," the Romanian Chief Commissioner Ichim explained to us.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had his home in another location.
We started walking somewhere in March, and in June-July we ended the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then I decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Ichim added.
Over the weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their lost girl in the hospital halls in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely bear his tears, and his hands trembled unstoppably.
He barely changes a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all nervous, he was shaking.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," a niece tells us, come with Costica de la Ruginosa.
Meeting Crina with Mother and Biological Brother
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and trap a household.
Mom's also nervous, she's crying, and she hardly thinks that anything like that could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think this could happen.
I saw such cases on TV, I kept thinking about these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," he tells us with great tears on the cheeks of Alina, the mother of Crina, while he holds a napkin tightly in his hand.
In him he hides his tears, of happiness, because soon he will see her with her daughter after so much bitterness for the time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will accomplish in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to settle like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory of them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iasi
In the Union Market, in the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginosa unites again with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years ago, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
No more borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the centre of Iash, passed easily.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if they get another chance, they will do it again.
It is the first event of this sort organized, of such an emotional load, and I am glad to be successful.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and we are most often associated as an institution that only deals with consumers, people who are drug-dependent.
But we're trying to get society back something good.
"If I'm still asked for such an event, I'll do it with great love," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advice Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, goes away telling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns to the foot yesterday at PSD.
Everybody shoots their soul
The camps in the outgoing PSD branch ended a gun-to-leg armistice.
After successive rounds of talks, carried from Friday to Sunday, the first being even the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the young social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from it is over, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to draw their soul.
Dragnea didn't give a ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion this weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing is certain has been established.
In the October elections, a successful competition is expected for the position of President of the Judicial Branch of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the party's main office, the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county councillor Vasile Quantea and interim president of the Council of Justice, Victorel Lupu are on the list.
They may also be added to the Mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into consideration is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD's county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu is no longer in the race, sources from the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates can be filed, and they wouldn't wonder if anyone would happen.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain together after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Jewish Permanent Bureau and all new management structures," said Quanta.
Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the county branch of PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, preparing the elections to be practically ensured by the branch's executive secretary, Judge Michael Popescu, in cold relations with Nichita camp.
Contacted telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to a "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus in the sense of supporting a uniting team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of applying for PSD Iasi, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A retired judge refused the rapist file in Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage.
The seven young men in Vasului County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Vasluians sentenced to punishment between five and eight months and eight months and four months will present today their arguments about their release, after which the fund court, the Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making an application for abstention, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton claimed that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How Judges Motivated Judgment
At the end of the last week, the magistrate at Vasului Judgeship who condemned the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In the motivation the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public opinion.
"The Court finds that, after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprived of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, was felt at the level of the local and national community a strong sense of indignation about the fact that persons accused of serious acts are tried under a less restrictive measure," is shown in the motivation of the Vasului Court.
The magistrates also demonstrated the main defense of the seven indictees who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The court points out that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight by the defences they have formulated, as physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states in the statement.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the past ten years can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
Until Saturday little world probably knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder how much can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of postwar farmers.
Marxist said, anti-monarchist (at one time he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathetic of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the Russian Today TV channel), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to quit nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the murder of Osama bin Laden as a true tragedy, ISIS is almost of a preference to the United States.
After the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the kind he was telling and promising and Tsipras in Greece until he gave birth to the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader provides, inter alia, massive renationalizations and printing of money as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some may wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimously adopted on the globe, we will then have global general prosperity!, but who should stop such details.
Of course, we can charge bankers with blood, become some kind of left-wing enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed up by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others is over".
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another left radical leader, Michael Foot, who was not as strongly convinced as the party's new leader, failed in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extended automations have made it necessary massively high-skilled labor force in the industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In his latest issue, Corbyn's choice is seen as increasing the chances of Brexit, i.e. the coming of Britain from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with the background of anti-immigration and look at the refugee crisis that shakes from the EU's foundations, you get to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the whole European project and the deep gaps created within its Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
More and more for a whole series of Member States, London was a counter-action to the Franco-German axis (in which however Berlin became the dominant actor more and more).
It's true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of the country's remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had just recently a sample in Jean-Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the head of the great majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens when electoral support for anti-immigration, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Eurosceptics increase spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negative emotional climate has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where and the conclusion that Financial Times draws when evaluating Brexit's chances.
The Pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make the decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
And Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are witnessing a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is fueling their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the past ten years, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both of which have been provoked by earlier decisions that have not taken into account solely the integrationist political ambitions, nor the ability and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's situation more.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Cheeses: "Go and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his fame, however, something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "trude."
What do you write about Constantine Brâncuși?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the notes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising flash.
Brocuses produce and deliver money almost 60 years from the time he's not among us anymore.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear their names.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brâncuși".
The country is plagued by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known from so many people, from children, to elderly people.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither did Communists succeed in removing it from Romania's memory and culture.
His quotes are spreading the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and share.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
Look at the bunch of books and articles that try to reconstitute his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that, if you haven't had the chance to be born in any big city and in a family as educated as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect example.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where the following text should be started.
With a sentence, however detestable these are.
Look at the cleverly successful stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he made it in life, how, today, did he hear a whole world map?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantine Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, Gorj county, at the foot of Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although it came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of which had to pick up the landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up in, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Teutăa, from Paris, from 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For the millenniums, people were leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
It all came quietly from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
Civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brâncuși's childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the home.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the tusuica "at the cazan" was being followed by those who taste the liquid to see if the process was going to be done properly, Brâncuși caught a moment of general disregard.
He fills his palms' tails with snorkeling and drinks on unscrupulous.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice a few minutes later.
My mother panicked, then hysteria, believing her son died.
To the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by the warriors, he sees from far away the desperate signs of those who wait with his soul at his mouth.
The party is immediately turned into a jale.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandşa, doftoroais and servants of the Branchos.
The cheese checks the child's breath, then puts it under the noses of the horse, gathered around.
The kid's sneezing hard.
The world applauds.
While the boy is let to sleep further drunk, happy, the fight party continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the livade.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine collects and brings them to him.
The father puts his child down with his head down and, with the nuisances brought by the boy, beats him to keep his head in mind.
And while he feels the sting of blows, little Brâncuși has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around can appear turned around.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well - known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in the old ladies, if somehow not the star participates in his disorder.
Had the sun as troubled as his father of what had happened to him?
At present, the city doesn't work
A parliamentary appeal to politicians to remind themselves of those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blejut called on the PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and redirect their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great disarray and so.
I didn't see any of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
No highways, no Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians discuss their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's just get a little out of politics, get together and talk.
At present, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Blejut said.
He appreciated that the current political class disbanded the electorate, the consequence of which was to be a very small presence in future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the electorate of the right, not of the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
"It crumbles even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blew.
He stated that he is not interested in a candidacy for future local elections, dissipating rumors about his intention to join the City Hall race.
I've said I don't want to run to any local functions.
I'm still thinking about whether to continue as a Member and in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the lobby discussions, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of me.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us unless they see anything," said Blejut, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electors.
A colleague from the Age said he couldn't get his money and he had to go on the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise money from the cashier.
At the end of the term of office I will report on everything I have spent, outside the salaries of the staff at the firm and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and the rest.
"Let's say a MP not get his money, it's a clean hypocrisy," concluded Blejut.
