Accumulated rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4 %.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compared with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy only.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 cases reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that of the province of Hubei, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by about 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar (additional material) COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
He stressed that, as at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in which countries are located, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed evidence.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of cases of VOCID-19 to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (data is not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios for the saturation of the medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 hospitalization associated with a risk of >90 % exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of ECDC on COVID-19.
As cases have so far been conglomerated in certain regions of EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional capture population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the statistical territorial unit nomenclature level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, should be prepared for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-COV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity for countries to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, creating a catastrophe for humans.
Similarly to its homologous virus, SARS-COV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a smaller severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research topic, which is developed rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgettable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 countries more than the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients high and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including their virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of multiple patients isolated virus.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this new subject that is being developed rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what is known so far about the prevention and forecast of the disease, as well as some key questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, i.e. SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003, and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported for the first time on 31 December 2019 of Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was made known.
On 15 January 2020, the first deadly case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the origin site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared a global health emergency to the outbreak.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 countries more than the world (fig. (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak still cannot be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 were infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded in conglomerates mostly in Hubei and in its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) were spent between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the era of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06 % (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a large, wrapped subfamily of viruses that contain a single-way RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
The glycoprotein of the backbone (S) of the wrap is attached to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4) for SARS-COV and MERS-COV respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the glycoproteins of the wrap and nucleocapside proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequence samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huhanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultradellated sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a SARS-COV-2 receptor, as well as SARS-COV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein joins human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 contains no known domain or functional motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic cryomicroscopy structure of ACE2 of complete length in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the transport amino acid B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can join two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic diana for the study of drugs in order to suppress the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated in bats and transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat is considered to be the native guest of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate guest helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the transmission route remains to be diluted.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-thorn mammals that feed on ants and tend to be used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99 % genetic homology in a discovered coronary virus in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference spread across the whole of two genomes remains a major difference; thus, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
The SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat rays at 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, ethanol at 75%, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective for disabling the virus.
The whole human population in general lacks immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and thus is susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study has been announced on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (fig. (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Co-operative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated immune system reaction locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure and even death.
Infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women more likely.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected people are expected to transmit the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by any other symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever or symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98 % for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dysnea and 3 % for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dysnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in line with the greatest lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26 %) and throat pain (21 %) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99 %-100 %), dry cough (29 %-75 %), dysnea (40 %-42 %), diarrhoea (20 %-25 %) and throat pain (13 %-25 %) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required by approximately 14 % to 20 % of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and rose to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 only ranged between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-COV-2 has a larger propagation capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, like a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people may carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who are discharged from the hospital may re-enter the virus, an alarm signal that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a <1×109/l lymphocyte count, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in chest X-rays in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral emerald glass shadows or opacities in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD).
When ARDS is produced, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, which reduces the lung capacity to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually paralleled to the highest severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of the COVID-19 showed the disaggregation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitium, and multinucleated sincial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based only on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology usage protocol to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-COV-2 ARN to between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a graduated rod in less than one hour requiring no complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include currently used or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the digestive tract and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (MEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used for the treatment of potentially deadly heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokin storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokines storm is a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiorganic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL6 receptor antibody, have been used to treat the cytokines storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokines storm are modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; blocking IFN-, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of path 4 signaling cytokines, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis significantly.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with critical COVID-19.
The effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed at the date of this analysis.
However, the efficacy of remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been verified.
Redesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remedesivir also demonstrated the potential for inhibiting other viruses with single-catenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The extraction of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who were seriously ill.
Her symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which may lead to fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high for treating patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that codify effective antibodies or search for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific COVID-19 therapy, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from serious stages.
For example, it was determined that the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used CTM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used CTM in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as patient quantity and severity, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment of western medicine (MO) only with combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for recovery from body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only.
Most surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT is still awaiting further well-controlled trials at higher scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to identify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidity was reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty of the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, people with suspicion and people who are in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in controlling emerging virus epidemics.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate potent, long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines have been evaluated with live viruses attenuated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is likely due to SARS extinction 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since then.
However, cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East continue to spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunes is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and to the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As it is a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS forecast, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people between 30 and 65 years of age and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have comorbidities and underlying complications and were considerably greater than those who did not require them (meaning 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictor of the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-COV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be joined to positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CPR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible forecasting factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine cinasa (CK) can also help predict the patient's evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and the liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as previously described, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replicating on the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently on the upper airways and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, early or incubation infected patients can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, whereas transmission was largely not occurring in the early phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Major efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of nearly the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have resulted in significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowing down of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the descending phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharynx exuds in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become an influenza-like cyclical episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that the Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through a tight quarantine and isolation, the disease has been controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by infections in ourcomonomy, including 17 patients with other pre-diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transponents in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with breather N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent fluid droplets of a potentially infected person from transmitting through the air or attaching to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure about 85 nm.
As particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, patients should use the N95 masks (series number 1860) and not the surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, medical care providers should use tailor-made isolation limits in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite using an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protective blankets or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more closely followed by the usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered to be a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-COV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have brought great warning to China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured the citizens that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message highlighted the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this harsh lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical information, rather than waiting for formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain an epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 countries more than the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of re-occurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and gravity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 % versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, causing a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the investigation of COVID-19, several important issues, such as the following, remain unresolved:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although 96 % of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original guest virus, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively slow down the transmission, and the outbreak can rejuvenate at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also join the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, extinguish as SARS or resurgence as a regular flu?
While it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many others.
Whatever it takes, however, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have led to the co-evolution of the co-operation of the coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly can be a human coronavirus infection.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronavirus in the attention center again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to your brother, SARS-COV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most of the human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reserve guests of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Researching the interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also shed important information about the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of existing knowledge about the seven coronaviruses of humans, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different coronaviruses of humans from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive single-catenary RNA viruses with wrap.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, due to the form of a crown under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyprotein.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), enclosing (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of accessories specific to each line are also coded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alpharonavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus), including the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes in most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five beta-coronavirus are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the recently identified SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower airways in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the spring of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The spring of SARS that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today's history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a raw lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the ongoing disease epidemic by coonavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world should be prepared for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and factors that restrict jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of future propagation.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogen of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reserve guests, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new guest.
We also look at the evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility often leads to reduced pathogenicity.
The evolution of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
It has been known about animal coronaviruses since the late 1930s.
Before the first time the HCOV-229E B814 strain was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the findings of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and later adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and the subsequent serial pass in lactating mice' brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to transmit predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCOV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower airways.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the etiologic agent is SARS-COV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the occurrence of maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dysnea, cough, and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function and high creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients then require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of an initial patient's family who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
HCOV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7 % of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs early in summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it was reported that HCOV-HKU1 was associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four acquired human coronaviruses in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as in the rarest case of a more virulent subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and continuously stay in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-COV first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed laboratory cases originate in the Middle East, occasionally imported cases have been recorded for close contact in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were recorded, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid-to late December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an internationally important public health emergency and also called the COVID-19 disease.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a raw fatality of 3,4%.
Notably, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
While SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82 %, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, we identify similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are most frequently observed in acquired human coronavirus infections in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed, as is the case with SARS-COV infection, although the relationship is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both the acquired human coronaviruses in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the acquired human coronaviruses in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human passage, as is the case with SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human coronavirus acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passage, will have an influence on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four acquired human coronaviruses in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From a different perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses of humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that have developed serious diseases by human coronaviruses have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the factors of restriction of the host.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 persists and the more infected people, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures of control of the infection.
For many years, the four coronoviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-COV and the highly pathogenic MERS-COV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to be maintained and propagated in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to potential human goals, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying guests.
SARS-COV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-COV and MERS-COV as well as the four acquired human coronaviruses in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the acquired human coronaviruses in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than acquired human coronaviruses in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without an animal reserve or intermediate guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, we will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reserve, intermediate and amplifiers of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve guest hosts a human coronavirus continuously and in the long term.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are natural guests of the human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate guest just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and is usually pathogen.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of the infection in humans and perform the amplifying guest function by allowing the virus to be replicated transiently and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal guest if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate guest and, even, generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
The epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Further research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-COV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Carves of masked palms (Paguma larvata) and a dog mapache in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-COV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-COV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all civets on the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palms or unexploded farms on live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets would only act as an amplifying intermediate guest, but not as a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
Notably, since 80 % of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities for several species of small mammals also to act as mid-term ampliators of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal guest of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related coronavirus of bats, called CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus bat related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herrage bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other mucilage coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92 % with SARS-COV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats house emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, may isolate as live viruses.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses ACE2 of bats, civetas and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, serums from convalescent SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-COV and that bats are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-COV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
The bat's CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host's receptor, the peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) for the virus entry.
The polymerase RNA sequences dependent on MERS-CoV RNA phylogenetically approach their beta-coronavirus counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a living MERS-CoV in wild bats.
The MERS-COV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Thus, the bat might not be the immediate reserve guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedarias are seropositive in neutralizing antibodies of the MERS-COV specifically, like camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the human virus was isolated from the exuded dromedary nasal, which further supports that camels act as guests of bona fide reserve of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus into infected camels for MERS-CoV investigations.
Notably, infected camels propagate viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of propagation of bat viruses.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown channels of transmission involving unrecognized animal species hosting the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a rat coronavirus, RaTG13, an isolation of Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the sequence divergence between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future Coronavirus of virtually identical bats.
Presumably, mid-term SARS-CoV-2 guests should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale fish market of Huan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolines (Javanic Manis), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RATG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more like SARS-CoV-2-like binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In sharp contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the RATG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which are equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assemblage and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the complete length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of the pangolin being one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal guests.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than that between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals must still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin, beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest full genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the betacoronavirus pangolines related to SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal defends a recombination between the beta-coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended among beta coronavirus.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have originated from rat coronaviruses, while the parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor bat of North America had a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another coronavirus of bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, but has also been suspected of camels as intermediate guests.
For the sake of clarity, the knowledge to date of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between HCOV-229E species is not known with such precision.
Alphacoronavirus of bats have been found closely related to HCOV-229E.
Among them is an alphachoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats directly to humans.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphacoronavirus of bats related to HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogens in bats, while alphacoronavirus alpacas caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no alphacoronavirus of alpaces has been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring alphacoronavirus related to human HCOV-229E cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens in humans, such as the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronavirus acts as a genetic acquis of HCOV-229E, alpacas and dromedarias could act as intermediate guests that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedarias, and from dromedary to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-COV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been introduced into the dromedary for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have passed from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta coronavirus of pangolines are highly pathogenic in the pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as civetas in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reserve host of a virus related to SARS-COV-2, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other single-catenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have a reading exorribonic acid, whose elimination results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inadmissibility.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonucleaase and the polymerase ARN dependent on RNA.
Redesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about one million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the guest.
Compared to SARS-COV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-COV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to the dromedary.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their efficacy rapidly.
Second, the long CAB genome of coronaviruses exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which leads to the emergence of new CABGs when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by copyable unique open reading frameworks and the functions of the encoded proteins towards direction 3' of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently of templates during the replication of the NRA through a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a guest who acts as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs often during the transcription of Coronavirus RNA.
Full-length and highly homologous subgenomic NRAs could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
There has been phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-guest interaction with transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, viral interaction with the host's receiver is another key factor that influences inter-species transmission.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV of humans and civetas, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the response of the host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which joins human ACE2 and its corrections for viral entry.
The SARS-COV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civet, mouse and dog mapache, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civeta viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the reason for bonding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The Civeta SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the stem protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of binding S protein with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater of this union compared to that of human ACE2 and S protein of SARS-COV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCOV-NL63 also joins ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as N aminopeptidease in HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetylate in HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the guest.
The divergence of these guest proteins between humans and natural reserve guests of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedarys and rodents, could be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp the guest's dependency factors and reverse the host's restriction factors to ensure that inter-species transmission is successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-huésped interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective, comprehensive genome investigation of guest dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New Human Coronavirus Appearance: We're leaving from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats act as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically change viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-COV, ORF8 has been considered important in the adaptation to humans, as they isolated bat viruses related to SARS-COV, but it was determined that they codify divergent ORF8 proteins.
A elimination of 29 characteristic SARS-CoV nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the polymerase RNA dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedari in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are recombinant with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely result in releasing viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the guest immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a complete length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 could be observed intact in mice and camels related to HCOV-229E, the alphacoronavirus of alpacas presents a single nucleotide insertion, which results in a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in their reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
The bats are apparently well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural asesine cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the natural asesine cell inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonucleasa, which provides the pressure of selection for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when they are introduced into a new guest.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation to the guest.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reserve guests, such as bats and camels.
They reproduce vigorously without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this are the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokines storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage is.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has dissociated itself from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy for delinking the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-COV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Although a betacoronavirus of bats has been found to share a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-COV, there is also a rat coronavirus that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been determined that civetas and other animals on the markets contain viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate SARS-CoV-2 guests have been identified.
Significantly homologous pangoline betacoronavirus has been found at SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangoline betacoronavirus could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered the protagonist due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human coronaviruses in transmission in humans.
Numerous evidence has shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civetas in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should withdraw from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coronavirus lines of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be diluted in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, are circulating in wild state.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombin themselves, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and response should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, opportunities for human contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural zoonotic virus reservoirs.
Several pieces are still missing in the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotics puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the real intermediate guest, it must be diluted how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-COV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will clarify the evolutionary route of SARS-COV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) triggered a outbreak, which is now officially known as the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, its work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some pathogenic or serological test characteristics as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing that shows high homogeneity to the recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or change of the specific IgG antibody against negative-positive SARS-CoV-2, or increase of title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or airways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is more and more evidence to remind us that we should be careful with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that further direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and complying with the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely way to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Investigation (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, the head of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dha.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was attending the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had started initially on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men returning from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
Over a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary infection and Zambia had its first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800) of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia spread curfews in the holy cities The Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 in the event that people had to self-insist.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper for delivery at home to a package on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous four-package restriction per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the demand "was unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworth ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer on Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult for them.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that the hygienic paper is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, intensifying the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article on the shelves, if products like rolls of toilet paper and disinfectants could [buy] and there would be large quantities, the panic would probably be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
Who Givens a Crap Recycled Hygiene Paper Manufacturer said last Wednesday that stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleinex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to keep the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time the weekend of the Workers' Day.
The edition of NT News Thursday, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page package designed to cut and be used as toilet paper.
The supermarkets at the beginning were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they did not have plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocat limited the purchases of hygiene paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization states that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2.
While the word "pandemia" only refers to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO said.
We are very concerned, both about the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, and about the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "is unprecedented."
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "in addition to the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "we've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition emerges after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an emergency of international public health.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is an ongoing disease pandemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of VOCID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories and about 97 000 deaths as a result.
About 364 000 people recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated to be 4 per cent in China, whereas worldwide it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth by coughing, keeping distance from other people, and controlling and self-sustaining people who suspect they are infected.
The authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, hazard controls at the workplace and closures of facilities.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic change, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s student population.
Misinformation on the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant cases of virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown case group of pneumonia, and an investigation began in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market for Huan seafood, so the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, pangoline coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to have symptoms became ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to have a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019 of a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei might have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and 19-year-olds accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of persons who submitted to COVID-19 tests and obtained a positive result confirmed according to the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had carried out tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to perform tests in people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86 % of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 % of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths corresponded to people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refer to deceased persons who were positive in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The number of real deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died may not be included without the test, for example, in their homes, in elderly homes, etc.
Part data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official registry of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimation", a statement corroborated by anecdotal sub-content reports in the United States. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths occurred in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths in all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators were generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of people who died from an illness, and the mortality rate for infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from an illness.
These statistics do not have a time limit and consider a specific population from the infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections in its entirety is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the case fatality rate.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
Peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without guests available.
But, at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
China's chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that "it could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow WHO's recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, as it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "may become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of the recurrence would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 %) and dry cough (68 %).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, spawning in the airways (flemish), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptissis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, pressure or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blue on the face or lips; in view of the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The greatest advance of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, do not have clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore the researchers advised carefully to monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected individuals in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more frequently it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spreading are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when talking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are near or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then you touch the eyes, the nose or the mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although propagation may be possible before symptoms are manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in the tests of the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few asymptomatic case reports confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not entirely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, usually one person infects another two or three. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed to pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that might have affected infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgeneral sarbecovirus (line B) together with two strains derived from the bat.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other samples of batselago coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangoline viruses and those of humans.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the pangoline coronovirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92 % of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pangolines are the intermediate guest.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed by the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan comparing the chain reaction of polymerase with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first published on 17 January.
The test uses the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed with a nasopharyngeal hisopus, although a hisopus for the throat can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be precise enough to approve their widespread use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of computed X-rays and tomography (TC) of symptomatic persons include asymmetrically illustrated peripheral glass opacitys and absent pleural spills.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by chain reaction of polymerase has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study conducted in China compared the results of chest computed tomography with that of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable cloth and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the community propagation phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register the proximity of one user to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. Wrong ideas about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nasal washing and oral rinsed gargas are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands visibly dirty; before eating and after ringing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDCs also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60% volume alcohol when no water and soap are available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a surface of stainless steel), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and iodinated povidone at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDCs recommend that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cashiers that have been used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with flexed elbow or with a disposable handkerchief to cough or sneez, and that they immediately discard the handkerchief.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, since the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the respiratory droplets that disperse when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people make cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited leaving public spaces without wearing a mask or without covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam called for everyone to wear a mask when they were in public places so that they could protect and protect others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks on the part of all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks a day since mid-March, on 1 April demanded the use of masks by passengers on trains and interurban buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to get out of the open, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical detachment) includes measures to control the infection designed to stop the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of health that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many Governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was reduced rapidly from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encourage them to keep in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person to live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-inflation was recommended in the home of those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions on appropriate self-assimilation. Many Governments have demanded or recommended the self-contained number of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter self-heating instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a generalised transmission are advised to self-contain for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are restraint or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
Where it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are transferred to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through the reduction of the basic number of reproductions to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk that health services will collapse and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and autoquaranteous; community measures geared to physical distancing, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass competition events; community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its gravity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to make quarantine and imposed great fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. The simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and deaths in half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The elimination may be preferred, but the virus must be maintained for as long as it is circulating in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), since, otherwise, transmission is reactivated rapidly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free-sale medicines for cold, drinking liquids and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on gravity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids may make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" may alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing the capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolate positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through training of staff and increasing the amount of available breathing and beds.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the patient called zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale market of Huan seafood, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, that has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a number of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed from those in charge of Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police advised eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reproved by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of unknown-cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and a major railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have been recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as home orders, shelter orders at the site or confinement) and curfews. On April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, comply with some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1300 million people are confined in India.
As of 26 March, 17 billion people around the world met some kind of confinement, increasing to 2600 million people two days later, about one third of the world ' s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan issued a public note.
WHO was reported on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police advised doctors in Wuhan to "cast rumors" on the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission at the outset stated that there was no "clear proof" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of mankind", on 23 January a health cord was announced prohibiting travel both inside and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Celebrations of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshhenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) faced some kind of restrictions on outdoor outlets. After the start of the global outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted to mainland China at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler returning from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was essentially blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, the travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the confinement had been imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended as from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The Council of State stated a mourning day which will begin with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10 a.m., coincidering with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to submit their respect online to comply with physical detachment in order to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a Daegu meeting of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of alert.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea remained quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and were therefore modified. South Korea presented what was considered to be the world's largest and best organized programme to test for virus detection in the population and isolate infected persons, as well as to identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with available results the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test by up to 20,000 people every day.
The South Korea programme is seen as a success in controlling the outbreak even though it does not adopt the quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon's removal, which they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad must remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for virus testing from 121 different countries.

Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday's prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five billion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic among cities as a result of the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a post-China virus propagation center.
In the midst of the assertions of a cover of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissidentity, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest recorded number in the country since the beginning of the outbreak.
As of 17 March, at least 12 Iranian expolitics or politicians had died from the disease.
On 23 March, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times as many cases as reported in Iran.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the relief of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed in Italy, when two Chinese tourists were positive in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading to the Italian Government suspending all flights from and to China and declaring the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of labor activities and sporting events in those areas has already been ordered."On March 4, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All important sporting events, including the Series A football matches, were to be held in closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanim and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy surpassed China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 pandemic deaths.

As of 5 April, there were 128 948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and most of those cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus so far could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The United Kingdom’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any type of social or massive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticisms of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he rejected social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' salaries to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social detachment measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those considered strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through fines and the dispersal of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware, gas stations and workshops.

On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank initiated emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the control and containment of the epidemic.
WHO pointed out the difference between the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004, when it accused the Chinese secretism authorities that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided regular updates to prevent panic in the New Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, although "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most concentrated place" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of the transmission of human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak of a public health emergency of international importance (ESPII), SPII sixth since the first action was invoked during the 2009 influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that SPII was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low and middle-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that interfere unnecessarily with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO made use of the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, and cited the urgency of supporting those countries "which do not have systems to detect those who contract the virus, if any."
Tedros also made statements stating that "we are just as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future."On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which WHO says will enable them to “focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the social, economic and broader development implications of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was launched to provide international experts and WHO on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and communicability of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to carry out site visits to assess the "impact of provincial and county response activities, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still very early to call it a pandemic, the countries still had to be "in a preparation phase".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent there a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "high" its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus can be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, as well as by the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received important criticisms, therefore considering inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed that the rights of all persons were respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group noted that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform for providing comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, in addition to viewpoints and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker and aims to help countries learn from one another and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were dismissed because of their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger for the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the U.S. or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the United States referred to the coronavirus as either the "Chinese Virus" or the "Wuhan Virus", and stated that the "Censorship of China overfed a virus that has now become a world pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distracted from the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a strategy of communications with apparent origin from the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All About China".
We have been told that we are trying to transmit this message in any way possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. "Communication media such as Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent aid to these last two countries.
On 3 April, U.S. sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And disputes relating to masks have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China answered bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" stating that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of engaging in a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and equipment cover impulses, they can also correspond if necessary."
The planned NATO “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will take place on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the 20th-century Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also those of the people of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian Government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as other fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, saying that his country is having difficulty combating the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election opportunities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any person from South Korea would remain in quarantine for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korea at the outset was polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand the removal of Moon, which they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could enable Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and the elections and punish those who are believed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
The outbreak of coronavirus was blamed for several cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased use worldwide of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand of consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left empty shelves of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which caused the shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for darigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, and have avoided a sharp shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not had a substantial reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the town of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to maintain reservations for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a newspaper report of 16 March, China's economy was heavily affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of considerable destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that the markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could exceed those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on supply chains in the world that could last for up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "revolved" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to China's lowest demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the largest drop in a day since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
The three indexes ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed the sovereign credit rating of China, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the greatest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lowest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Regional Flybe airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise business sector reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to the holidays of the Chinese New Year.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's Holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80 % of GDP and 90 % of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected worldwide, with reductions in attention schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The retailers of North America and the Middle East experienced a fall of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a 33 to 43 % drop in pedestrian traffic at malls in March compared to February.
The operators of trade centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as more hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 million and 22 million people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than they had been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million migrant rural workers from China were swept away in their homes in provinces of the interior or trapped in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates from the San Luis Federal Reserve Bank. The Indian border has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. About 900 000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the completion began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes supported by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and arts organizations tried to carry out their mission (often financed from public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the security of their employees and the public and support artists when possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated pace of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian Lent Penance.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than participate in the Sunday Mass; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcast over the Internet or television, while others offer places to pray from the automobile.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the sanctuaries, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to sacred places in La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019–20, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming sites around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and Asian origin, and towards people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports of February (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside.
Following the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at the outset signed petitions for the prohibition of Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and ancient.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, who study in the main Indian cities, were harassed in relation to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese Consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "misleading." In China, xenophobia and racism were increased to non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign stronghold" and intended for "desiration".
Many newspapers with pay walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory disease and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase, which detects the coronary artery DNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Tests of antibodies show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had carried out tests at more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be greatly overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hysopate or foam samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours of 2 days.
The chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hysopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In those infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by means of a suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the tosser (spute) may be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the company of South Korea Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Find the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency approval from the National Medical Products Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic chain reaction panel of polymerase with inverse transcriptase in real time for the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits produced unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a failure to perform tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and it was only since then that state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As at 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 tests based on chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Centre for Research on Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the FDA emergency authorisation for a test which takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermic amplification technology of nucleic acids rather than polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to carry out 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronovirus, hoping that it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur".
Typical features in the CT include bilateral multi-lobar opacities in glass illustrated with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, pattern in impedation and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with the computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a front-line test for diagnosing COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDCs have recommended the chain reaction of polymerase as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system reaction to infection is antibody production, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and population surveillance. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For testing at the point of attention, one specimen of blood is usually obtained by means of a puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step prior to the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that notified the agency as appropriate and can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of viral RNA polymerase.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits into the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time. The British NHS announced that a pilot program is implementing to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the tests at drive-through centers for the COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes the samples with the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians Stationaries said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to perform 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample was positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, BGI opened an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (chino: , or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10 000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47 per cent higher and that the corresponding cost to face the quarantine had been doubled without this capacity to carry out the tests.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multiplexed open-source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid-manufactured robots.
By March, insufficient and insufficient quantities of reagents affected massive evidence in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to do more testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more testing of coronary virus per person in its population than any other country, and was headed to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of the drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI level (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of chain reaction tests of polymerase with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that sent low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea tests helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private laboratories of the United States, and supplies of hypopods and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs had "defects"; the government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits in China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
The conduct of tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contacted those who had positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of those who had positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from outside, testing and quarantine, the Coronavirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore moved much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend residents staying in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the 23 March holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less strict confinations, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, the countries that have done more testing, in relation to the number of deaths, have lethality rates for much lower cases, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who only have mild symptoms or have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that are not able to carry out tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience at COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of Tests" column is influenced by the policy for conducting proof of the country.
A country that only performs evidence in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positives as % of evidence that a country that performs evidence in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are equal.
Washing hands, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Handwashing with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral pathways.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as common influenza or cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose rings, cough or sneez.
After touching animals, feed for animals or waste animals.
Hand medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can generate small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce almost 50% the mortality rate for these diseases.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by approximately one third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48 per cent of the decreases in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as self-contained behavior in households, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are charged.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together represent nearly 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the death by diarrhea and one-quarter the death by acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin resequence.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand-washing may cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin become squamous known as eczema of the hands or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common in health workers.
Washing hands too frequently is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fetal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (to urinate, defecate), after cleaning the tail of a child (to change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other occasions where a proper hand-washing technique should be practiced to prevent transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families were doing handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States was about half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviors, to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Group hand washing of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwashing into child behavior.
The "Essential Health Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote the health and education of children.
Disappear twice a year, besides washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms improves by adding soap or detergent water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
Nevertheless, the CDCs claim that "liquid soap with dispensation controls is preferable that do not involve the use of hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been actively promoted for a health conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics should be used to preserve organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as it is promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent and which protects the skin, the sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mintol, extracts of plants). An exhaustive analysis of the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to eliminate bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to eliminate natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and in the first part of the twenty-first century, the agents for the hygiene of the hands without water and with alcohol for the flotation (also known as alcohol-based solution for the flotation, antiseptic solution for the hand to rub or disinfectants for the hand) began to acquire popularity.
Most of them are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickener agent such as carbomer (crylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol resequency.
Add diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95 % alcohol at least eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants for flotation eliminate bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-floating disinfectants containing 70% of alcohol remove 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4-5 logarithms) from bacteria in hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Enough solution should be used for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands to flotate, as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The tip of the fingers should also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommend handwashing before disinfectants for hand to rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid activity of removing microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for the appropriate handwashing unless water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfectants for alcohol-based hands may resuscitate the skin, unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol dryness can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emollients caused irritation and dryness of the skin considerably lower than the antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to provoke contact irritation was attractive compared to washing hands with water and soap.
In spite of their effectiveness, waterless agents do not eliminate the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for hands without alcohol depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rub.
More recently, it has been found that the formulas using benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land instead.
Ashes or land may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if land or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Fry your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps eliminate the germs of the skin, and restricting for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Dry well with running water.
Drying in a container can again contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The most frequently forgotten parts are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the fingernails
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from resuscending; dry skin may cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand-washing when there is no running water or soap, for example, pouring water from a hanging cane or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if needed in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home farms" and other economic options.
A homemade tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jug of a rope and a lever with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective drying in public baths.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towels industry, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, 194% in the finger buds and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42% in the finger wells and 15 % in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in the finger buds and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment was possible as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit to speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and potentially pollute other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study carried out by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers have been compared to the drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with disinfectant hand towels is an alternative during travel, when you have no water or soap.
The alcohol-based disinfectant shall contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The handwashing of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
The handwashing of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be held together by interlacing their fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a brush of pigs to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from recontaminated by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the medical care environment is to eliminate the pathogens ("germen") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that the correct hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating the hand washing and standard hand rubbage in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if evidence of normative compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for handwashing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
After taking care of patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (medicinal or antibacterial soaps) gives you the possibility to eliminate the hand-washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very common. To wash their hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a gryphon that can be opened and closed without touching their hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry their hands after washing, a sterilized brush to rub and another sterilized instrument to cleanse under the nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical rod is placed.
To reduce germ spread, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20 % of washing and that there is little additional benefit when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than triple the incidence of food-borne bacterial infections compared to antibacterial soap washing. By comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand-washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol-flotting reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective for reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and hard-hand Clostridium spores than alcohol-based disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of disinfectant for alcohol-based hands, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the various health-care environments.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few taps to wash their hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can also be the result of deep-rooted habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a change in behaviour in the long-term population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective to increase hand-washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns for hand-washing that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that seeks to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-2020 konavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand-washing in developing countries in relation to avoidable AADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who had just been born or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more active hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters were hanged with "right hand washing techniques" next to the toilets of the public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "handwashing" is a statement of not wanting to take over anything or sharing the complicity of something.
It has its origin in Matthew’s Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, which represents her awareness of guilt over the crimes she had committed and that she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after recalling or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more elements for handwashing.
Moreover, those who have allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilá and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend washing of hygienic hands, in particular after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to wash after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to be washed before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace before COVID-19 relate to the application of hygiene and occupational safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of COVID 2019 disease (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the workplace and are based on an assessment of exposure sources risks, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be likely to contract VOCID-19.
According to the U.S. Administration of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), work with a lower risk of exposure has minimal employment contact with the public and colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand-washing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Work at medium exposure risk includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with persons who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by the current Community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective blankets and individual protective equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral services workers, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high levels if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in persons who are known to or suspected of having COVID-19 or who take or manipulate samples of these individuals.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 may have several consequences at the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, because they have to take care of others or because of fear of exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded and the means of purchasing such goods (such as buying in non-peak hours, by means of home delivery services or by car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at increased risk of adverse health complications, maintaining commercial operations and minimizing adverse effects in other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to the behaviour of workers and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard for the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to pollute.
According to the U.S. Administration of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), works with lower risk of exposure have minimal employment contact with the public and colleagues.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory hygiene rules that include coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper cloths and containers for waste, the preparation for telework or phased shifts if necessary, deter workers from using other tools and equipment, and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medicines to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick relative, and that employees know about these policies.
According to OSHA, works with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or close contact of less than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person made an international trip recently to a place with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a large concentration of people and certain large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective decks and placement of a service window for the customer to be able to request from the automobile. Administrative controls for this group and risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replace in-house meetings with virtual communications, establish staggered shifts, suspend non-essential travel to existing COVID sites, develop emergency communications plans including a forum for workers' concerns, provide training and updated training to workers on risk factors or in individual settings and preventive behaviours in relation to COVID, which are not essential to the existing COVID-19 outbreaks, develop emergency communications plans to respond to workers' concerns, provide training and training to workers on the risks of individual living conditions, and conducts of prevention in relation to the existing COVID, which would be able to be able to the work of workers and be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to work, to be able to be able to be covered people and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be covered, to be covered to be covered, to work, to be able to be covered, to be covered, to be covered, to be able to be covered, to be able to be covered, to be covered, to be covered with the work, to be covered with the work, to be covered with the work and to be covered with the work and to be provided with the work and to be covered with the work, to be covered with the work, to be covered with the work, to be covered with the work in the work in the work, to be covered with the work and to be covered with the work in the work in the work-hoc
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a member of the crew to assist the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper cloths when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a hazardous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by illness, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical center on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal thing is for medical check-ups to be done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between the desks, stepping in and out, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it is possible to consider extending the cancellation of classes. For the staff of police forces carrying out daily routine activities, CDCs consider the immediate risk to health to be low.
Officers of police forces are advised to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers should clean and disinfect their work belts and their equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before reusing them and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health workers and morgue workers are within categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the works at high risk of exposure, are those of delivery workers, support, laboratory and medical transportation who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become works of very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they are now at very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or COVID-19 suspicions, even when they are performed aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be adequate in some medical and morgue care environments.
Samples should be handled using Biosafety Level Precautions 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with a filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends only the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, they pay attention or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, robes and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use it, replacing it with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the access to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only those involved in their direct attention, using the same mask without removing it while providing attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

Subject: [Covid-19] To lighten the load and prepare us for the future
DATE/VIEW DAY: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we meet in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents have no precedent, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community-building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing are the people with whom we are lucky to work.
I could not feel more grateful and proud that you are all my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues receive their payment or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this one, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timelines
As mentioned earlier Robyn, the C team met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place at present, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, shop or go to a doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say so, we say so.
There is no need to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just report to your manager and help your team review the schedules and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and ensure that management is aware of your situation).
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and colleagues of staff who work per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is your personal care.
What we ask you to do is communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
Site Confidence Engineering Teams, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery, among others, carry out critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and change our approach to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic ends.
Extra hours will not be expected to be worked on deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new objectives and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To meet our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning and pressure loads throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will report the next steps to the delegates and teams we will hardly have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning equipment to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral hospital use solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own care duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to come back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the patterns shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still under way, but it is possible that they will stop.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who were already working remotely from before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of not more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Set up a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare refund for refreshments.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The RR. HH. Operations team is analyzing the ergonomics guidelines based on web seminars to support increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we asked all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the publishing houses, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to comply with their share of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Later, CRT will be working to set up a page in Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintain contact with COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., coordinated universal time/7:00 p.m., Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take advantage of this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information about this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries currently being heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you might need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have sensitive or confidential matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are an acknowledgement that, at this time, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and give the world the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and take place for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that they can find themselves in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is an enzyme that adheres to the external surface (cell membranes) of the lungs cells, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic diana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptide M2 and a C-terminal domain of renal transporter of amino acids of collectin.
ECA2 is a unipasus type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is removed from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is attached, mainly, to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to the arterial and venous endothelial cells and to the blood cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The MARN expression of the ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, the strided body, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract the ECA.
The ACE turns off the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 releases carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
The ECA2 can also burn several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, apple, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes of the transporter of neutral Amino acids SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronary artery viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 strain protein of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomas within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the guest's TMPRSS2 protease serin, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing inhibitive therapy of ACE and standard BRA .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in lechons with lipopolyaccharides-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to assist with tracking contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people ("contacts") that could have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register the proximity of one user to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to admit these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore a app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open-source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia it was launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol from Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through the coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat is passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the expansion of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital monitoring should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protections against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse should be implemented;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporting on one Grenzen, RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used, rather than applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out the tracking of contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, something that is permitted due to wide-ranging changes to the privacy laws of information after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well established concept, with a large amount of published research dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to register the proximity of one user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never emerge from the device and all the matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location data or route intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Out-of-control applications: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was originally founded in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly-matched protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for achieving broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that they assured would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the major technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of adoption and persistent surveillance by distributing, first, the system through updates of the operating system and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with the binding.
The analysis of these union sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, NRA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, protein S, and ribofafatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several medical-interest compounds that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquina is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York Andrew Cômo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent authorisation of use (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to a US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctors said they used the drug when "there's no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are under way.
The NYU Faculty of Medicine is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was administered humifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or who try to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, critical has emerged regarding the allocation of resources for the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial Solidarity.
Redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that remedesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple phylovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus, and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate illness and one for those with a more severe illness.
Three intravenous vitamin C trials are ongoing for people hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York started trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclosonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is under way and 200 severe patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin to reduce inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registering 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who breastfeed or do not have an affective birth control method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on their use.
On April 14, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-COV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying a lot of attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a mortgage vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five potential vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the ECI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the dianas of the main platforms that went to phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
In total, 115 potential vaccines were reported to be in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (it is presumed to be planning or developing).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active developing vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (following the preclinical investigation).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work in a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-sarrolling an oral vaccine with his biotechnological partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology used in the treatment of neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that the tests were starting.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he was starting a project to create a peptide liv-key vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emerging Bioslutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although moving forward fast, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported on the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine", before which the German government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an RNAm-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in the Epidemic Preparation (ECI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research partnership for a COVID-19 vaccine including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of the ECI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
The other ECI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing animals of six potential vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding from CAD 275 million for 96 medical action research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Faculty of Medicine at Pittsburgh University announced the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from the specific antigen antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, together with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomised essay in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, show the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SRA and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing SARA research could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovir vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory that the causing virus of the COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the ARAG coronavirus.
b'Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of the smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress with viral pneumonia and multiorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time inverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hysopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use masks, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of WHO.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms on the upper airways, such as sneezing, nasal drip, and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, the preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases were asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The China National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both the spit and the saliva can have great viral loads.
Speak loudly releases more droplets than when spoken with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can make droplets travel 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside the dorms of people gave positive in viral ARN.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR) may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through stools, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear the ease with which it spreads, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if they are used properly. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus as it relives its protective bubble. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, due to the virus entering the host cells through the converting enzyme of angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31 %) and venous thromboembolism (25 %) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died by IVOD-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrations with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells expressing the ECA2 of the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that the T lymphocytes secretory of pathogen GM-CSF correlate with the recruitment of secretory monocyts of IL-6 and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time inverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of the airways obtained by nasopharyngeal hysopate; however, samples of nasal or spout hysopate may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain from the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but they were not widely used.
The experience in China with the evidence has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 to use it at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan suggested methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular esmerinated glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disordered empedrate (lobulillar septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of VOCID-19 are available.
The main pathological results of autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exuds.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying in the home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap often for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDCs recommend covering their mouth and nose with a tosser or sneezing handkerchief and, if they do not have handkerchiefs, use the inner part of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of cloth taps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling mass public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as very soon, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
The CDCs also recommend washing their hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, in particular after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in time. For areas where hand-based disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antiseptics."
Glycerol is added as moisturizer.
Patients are provided with support care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those who suspect that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (MOEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and neurologists in the US compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of the symptoms, some medical professionals recommend simparatamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised in order to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care environments when procedures are carried out that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (IIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDCs highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP's coat, mask, protective forearms and medical gloves. When available, the respirators are preferred (instead of the masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by an urgent user authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but they do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When no masks are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective blankets or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of the cases do.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure on the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two offers the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are reported mainly in older adults (up to 60 years of age and, in particular, older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, limiting the ability of the health system to handle the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADDS) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators need different modes of pressure control and PPTE to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, a number of medicines are already being tested for other uses or are under advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in efficacy and safety testing of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to the covalent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also alerts local health officials. Analysis of cell information macro data, facial recognition technology, mobile monitoring and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data on mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data of the location of the telephones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect violations of quarantine.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera told you that mobile telephony operators have informed you that "40 per cent of people are still on the move anyway".
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global application for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience anxiety about quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can follow a slight evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will appear to other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as common cold.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of having a serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARG and SROM virus, but the COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most serious cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress to the respiratory distress syndrome of water (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorganic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorder and heart, kidney and liver damage.
The alteration of coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been observed in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal function impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30 % of people with CODIV-19 have high liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the mean time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, a mean period of seven days was spent between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the mean time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the male mortality rate was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Cytopatic viral changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from March of the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had pre-existing conditions; the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or to die compared to non-smokers. They worry about long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease of 20-30 per cent of lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and the images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of the COVID-19 have been reported that they later gave positive in coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was December 8, 2019.
In general, a number of measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of evidence, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of ICD-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The figure varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of persons diagnosed who die from a disease, and the mortality rate in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence can provide information about how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected young people, so there was a relatively low mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004 % of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only narrowed at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of smokers and the fact that men have common conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were males and 72% of those who died by COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track information on sex in COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARA, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and have more potential for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of persons, in line with international recommendations rises name to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer both to the disease and to the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasal hysops and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the required 100 valves during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were rapidly spread over the Internet emerged.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY TEST" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds on efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-COV is being used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, this research focuses on S protein that helps the virus get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (dNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of either of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the virus's genetic code that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute the largest part of Chinese research, including nine phase III tests on redesivir in several countries and which should report in late April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccines and possible anti-COVID-19 drugs was under way. Several antiviral medicines were evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of an attempt on the effectiveness of remedesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquina, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
There are, however, requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that double that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
It has been recommended that more in vivo Nitazoxanide studies be conducted, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial strain of S protein that performs type 2 transmembranary serin-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-COV-2 through interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. China's National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment patterns after completion of a small study.
It is found in a national test not randomised in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood analysis to identify cytokine releases, these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system is being investigated for people who have been recovered from the COVID-19 as a passive immunization method without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SARG with unconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies, for example, are being developed using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, who later died by COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
