European inflation has slipped in food
Accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, is primarily due to the dramatic price growth of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced by the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely to give 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "must negotiate" on inflation so that it does not subsequently have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, struck the 12-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Quotations at the end of the wheat increased by 88 percent and soya quota has also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost 100 dollars a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months about 3 percent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats significantly increased, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe electors of the parties - due to the strongest of the voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth for the socialists (about 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary scan: their support within the entire population is about two per cent.
Between the safe voters there is one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 per cent believes that the situation is quite bad.
The families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population has a deterioration in the situation and only a tenth of the population expects improvements.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, considered the President of Government to be rather bad than good at his duties.
13 percent of the consultees trust or very much trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent support.
54 per cent of the population does not trust the Chief of Government at all and 27 per cent does not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation is that, what proportion of society believes it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the disturbances in October last year 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (about 33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question about participation replied that they would surely participate and another 20 per cent said that it is likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday", only 55 per cent of the population would participate safely and another 15 per cent would believe their participation. Based on the current intentions of the electorate there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service, and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electors would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
The average price increase of 16 per cent remained the hypermarkets of the Budaörs Gold Commercial Triangle, with the difference this year that VAT has not been increased.
Napi Gazdaság article
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the thousands HUF.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared", so there was no dramatic increase in percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is evidently terrifying for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price far below the nine thousand HUFs, today they cannot even do it for ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 this basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in pechua, nut and poppy seed fillet.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a resimitable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the most expensive basket values of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so last year's Christmas price increase was felt by VAT.
Just this process was the one that destroyed the trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, it may lose an important benefit on the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The price increase in the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was more expensive with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not occur such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent the price of consumer goods was increased.
(But this does not necessarily confirm the Central Statistics Office figures: this office, in the case of some basic necessities, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month range.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was registered, in the worst of cases only 10 percent of price increase.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose the drastic price increase even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial golden triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three shops visited no longer care about prices.
Of all products, they buy large quantities, taking preserved foods by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, the three shops formed large queues in front of the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income falls below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, first of all, due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the chief doctor of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
A infection with MRSA has recently been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA and no significant surgical intervention has been performed since then because of the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10, this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - said Karolina Böröcz, the head physician of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been recorded safely in hospitals, and there is no information available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methylline-oxaciline.
One third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, infections of wounds) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are over-applied or improperly applied, bacteria that usually react well to antibiotics become very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and quickly become infected with inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, such as infection of wounds or septicemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with a weakened body, to elderly or to people with little weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic Resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff serve them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, but current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of formation and contamination with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients carrying MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological samples are not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This fact is also due to the fact that these medical examinations are not funded by the National Health Fund.
So most of the cases come out in public light when MRSA infections are already occurring visible in the patient - the head doctor of the department of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union is making strict commitments to the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Antibiotic therapy should be undertaken, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less common in the case of outpatients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health care personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, use of rubber gloves and masks is a very important role, but also in this regard considerable shortcomings are experienced in hospitals.
The MRSA is infected by drop-out transmission and direct contact between individuals, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, you can also experience - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favorable economic conditions is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, there are fewer such infections or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection is an enormous expenditure for the National Sickness Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
It appears that the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholemia of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the deadly accident caused by the district police commander XXII.
The possibility of drunk or in a state of shock may be ruled out that since then the dismissed commander of the 21st District Police, who hit and caused the death of a transponder, reported on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case was prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary alcohol control that he had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of police station in the 21st District, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle by bending Kossuth Lajos Street in the 21st District, struck a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, in other words, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give in by bending.)
The transistor lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest for a total of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be made from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit contract worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit contract of EUR 150 million is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the Fourth Line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary completes with the EU the details of the Metro financing, they will again discuss the subject whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this will take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for maintaining the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, which will grow faster?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is no doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach cottages.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most popular, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people search for real estates also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of the real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia may be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, so it can be a remarkable destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already shopping, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category is chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 German holiday destinations).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate is considerably higher than the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are deliberating on the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Discussions on the particulars of developing and industrialized countries are currently taking place.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to reach the agreement that, compared to the situation in 1990, up to 2020, it decreases by 25 to 40 per cent the emission of greenhouse gases.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to the developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a 16-member management board, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent to 2020, regardless of whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit itself to a reduction of even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatory to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol were committed to decreasing by 5.2 per cent, thus 15 EU Member States committed to achieving 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period 1985-87, which our country will fulfil - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is much that is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its latest report by the IPCC, an international scientific partnership of the United Nations dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C of the average temperature on Earth, which would, according to scientists, have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
British Army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) first took advantage of YouTube services: Special Units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headsquaters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, both the Ministry of the British Community (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence, they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda practically costs nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the BBC told the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - but inevitably they have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the highly edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear on the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of the losses, but do not present the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way of recruiting shooting video games, downloadable for free, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tomb and salty pie at the Christmas party of the ministries
The minister of work Móika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with pastry and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited to the families of the soldiers who currently perform missions abroad. Likewise, a reception will be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday environment at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious holiday with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320.000 HUF and of the six hundred ministers in the ministry, the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty are expected.
At the portfolio party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also act and there will be tombola draw.
The birth of the ANF cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the over four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANP departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the words of greeting from the minister and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [orgo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to dress suit or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Labour Minister Monika Lamperth does not expect her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
It is counted on the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will only take coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply give his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget you will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The farm portfolio will offer a New Year reception on 20 January, and Christmas will not be held in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the Minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments have communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
Gathering the forces of the giant strike
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law - the labor stop will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be stopped completely and workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike up to 13 hours.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machine Union will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will take an indefinite strike, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the trade unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only public health law may be voted on at very late nights, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways it will cease to work indefinitely, in the morning there may be some part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the inter-urban bus transport of Volán companies.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some trade unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach agreement even on the minimum services, but as Christmas parties approached, more and more people were traveling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m. will hold a four-hour strike of the Liga Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educational Unions called a strike of 2 to 8 hours and the Democratic Union of the Educators.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) forming part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and submits a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, for early retirements the possibility that the occupations that deserve to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk by the Hungarian Guard increases
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Capital Policy, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
The company's "risk warning" is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is that "with the worsening of the ethnic tensions existing between the Roma and non-Gypsy people of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - the representative of the Research Institute added.
They stated that this was due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave public debate of the Gypsy problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they believe.
Moreover, according to the Research Institute, the activities of the National Guard, as a result of the high attention of the national and international average, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that since the fall of 2006 there has been increasing publicity and momentum for the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 many organizations have been formed in the country to define "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they are self-defining as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defence, defence of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - they add.
They said: all of this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give him a civil presentation of different political aspirations, based on the disenchantment of society with politics and with political parties.
We can highlight civil society and the form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighboring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard,
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way that, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, over the past 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes which certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced will be their own guard to resist.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, the Research Director of Political Capital, told the news agency: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk change, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holiday days - that the coming year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America are the parties united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national parties, state parties and holidays.
The holidays are mainly linked to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest those who have spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It was a national festival on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May the celebration of the work, on 1 and 2 November we remind our relatives and friends who have died.
In addition, there are two-day parties in our country on Easter Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national, or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends so, during the previous Saturdays you cannot leave work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when you have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
However, it is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work may be altered only around the end of the year parties: from December 24 almost stops life in the country, because according to experiences, most people "make bridges" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid-term or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in the working hours than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the work party so that, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23rd: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming at the end of the year can be rested, since from December 24 will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to bitterness your colleagues' lives
E-mails we forgot to send, sound messages we never received, innocent lies that pass us unaware: they are all part of our everyday Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to the minor discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that might irritate others.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you they've been looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a date?
In the best of cases you feel it and try to fix the matter, you might as well call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to loud explanations, it is worth meditating on the things you can hurt your colleagues' lives with and consciously strive to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you don't find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly be mad at you for removing their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Chismeas about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
It fills in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, though others also know the things about him.
Are you on sick leave unwarrantedly?
When you call the office over the phone and say you're sick and it hurts your head unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel like that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your unstoppable tasks, your work in the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something will happen to you, so you have to stay at home, tell them, so that your colleagues or your boss won't have to face you away the next day.
Tarareos, laughter, phone calls
You're in your job, but you're suddenly getting rid of him with your colleagues' laughs?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to it?
Do not bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them above their heads), pataleos, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontent in a loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished anything in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Do not mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, nor the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable room for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Do not see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation permits!
Don't be disgruntled, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing daily, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires!
Lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Changes the rhythm of music and to the previous tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true gem intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the Wings of Love song in Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually changing the image and although again in fashion the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are developments under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played on the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, electronic and pop music, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that in the beginning only acted in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trends trainer, able to sell in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The new album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title itself intends to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and tendency of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with The Puzzle ensemble.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of radioists the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song may arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Outside, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There are not only the fifteen-year-olds and twenty-year-olds who attend concerts, but also the oldest ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made his career more than the West of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow their path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work together, trust the musical presence of the other and let it evolve.
At first it was inevitable that we compare our works with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we started another way.
hvg.hu: On the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Have you consciously opened up with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B: We did not intend to make big hits and sell our album with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a jospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists in good voice from our own national musical scene.
This is how that choir of six women was created - namely Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodesi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly compose the song or the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the album, we think there's still something missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited at the time, but of course I also needed the Divas.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the disc looks like the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they all sing together and not stronger than music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
However, we consciously did not want to distribute papers from soloists.
The song also covers it, about which we forget a moment our ego, who who from where he has come and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love rise.
He would have wanted to make others too feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What more work did you do?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when mixing, there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little everything went to place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with concerts and because I've already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous bag runner risks billions for its inferiority complex
Disloyal evil man.
This is what his former employee Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good skills.
Long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard of his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what comes out of Kerviel's answers according to what the French media transcends, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a gain of over 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her coming in early this year.
In February they began to hear some news about the sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, his earnings exceeded the 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already won my first 500 million I don't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, "it has left nothing for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that the records had been falsified in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in their business.
Risk became a benefit
Was he afraid he'd come to find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought that I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much will to risk that way?
My position was to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was between 51,000 dollars.
Two years later he was already a stock broker, and in 2005, he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Even so, I knew I would never win as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already observed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this came up with a boot mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost billions of euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase any fingerprint.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they track him down?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who has no vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file" Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of achieving 365 billion
The Czech Government Ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be produced for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State's transport infrastructure fund, which will amount to 90,800 million krona next year.
The Business and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that less use them.
Twenty-year sentence for Nicaragua's president, the court ruled
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals decreed on Thursday the 20-year sentence for the country's president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the clearance of $100 billion (almost 1,800 million crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency that, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in line.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on prison officials if they let German finish his punishment at home or if they make him go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that German was constantly transferring government money to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictional and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German set up to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote on trust to the government this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential one, quietly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with every chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it conceals the rivalry of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media to devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last Social Democrats governments have suffered from three shortcomings that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenses of the representatives who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved before last year's elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not the deficit in the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the bank's tax, tax and credit money, often issued disproportionately disproportionately obligations with which they owed their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks that have received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we follow only the official facts and verified, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, from what is boasted ČSSD.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
That is why there is no need for the massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have in recent years been unnecessarily carried out with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform will not change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, governing who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that politicians who rule will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on normal expenses of the agents.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what it could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who rule to become officials only for that reason to be patient and to grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Marking will receive more than $100 billion through invitations to tender.
In these tenders, banks undervalue the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid for $4 billion, and then another $22 billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it was the first time that central banks from different states agreed on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his customer report, a consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"The central banks must really fear what awaits them even when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's leading economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to pay more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," said Reuters, company Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to lighting up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus expressed himself again with regard to the problem of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that environmentalist debates are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, "I often only find myself with the caricature of my ideas."
Now the stakeholders can be informed about their diverse views.
Klaus recalled that he is not an climatologist but has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianisms, it considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which it feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained to these questions that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people didn't get to change their driving card
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and thus did not succeed in changing their old driving card whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials can take them from time to end of year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the meat hasn't changed it primarily those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in peoples there is a rapid decline in the shift of meat, the metropolitan offices are full of requests and the interest in the new sheep has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers a day.
The queues are expected for half an hour.
In Prague the new card has not yet been taken out about 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay for fifty crowns.
Drivers who must change their carnage and not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid carnage will be at risk of a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infringement with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be paid to that person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to receive fines of up to 1,000 crowns in moderation.
According to the transport ministry vocals, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving card is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over the driving card.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meats issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of drive.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty to the complicit detectives in Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with delinquent David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in jail.
The High Court of Prague decided, as a definitive expiry, to reduce the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department were fighting organized crime, which was going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this, in other processes it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 persons and today the higher court revoked 16 of them.
The majority of the defendants' allegations were rejected by the investigation because they were invented cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims were seriously affected by their health, but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without arms permits.
In the home registry, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change some children: 12 million
For the change of children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the families concerned, Igor Veleba, wants the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers no more than 200,000 per father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal is not in principle in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
"That demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"So that we can get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report from the specialist that the counterparty had to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a reciprocating value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month they didn't raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the expert's report, except that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress from different levels and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by the nurses at Třebič's Motherhood House last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 crowns as compensation costs for the error committed at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors you have to extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily you can ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far recognized their proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valakia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka was not present today at the oral hearing.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will resort.
"The complaint is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," said after the trial, Polivka's lawyer.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valacia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the complaint is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could therefore also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polivka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a matter of directing it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later at Harabiš he was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic source, it resulted in a lucrative business and business activity of which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in passports and even offered his owners discounts to the visitors of his farm and assistants to their shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"Of course Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who have dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized official coronation in Vstin for Polívka.
From then on, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "king Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš's mediation, came to the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and its society which has been rejected by the court so far.
Something clear could bring to the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal even more data and dates.
"We have no hurry.
It would have to be something like the King's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can be introduced," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: extreme prejudice
I really never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its walking characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is his successor, Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and to me, I'm just thinking about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the header space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi bodywork means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I'm going inside fast so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the invention of design even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
In contrast to model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the bodywork measures have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned scarcity of space in the header.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This I must value as very accessible (thanks to the abatable rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, under a basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the same kind of vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that Peugeot falls behind its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or by placing the child’s driver’s license their value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that is pretty flat after cutting the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a 1.6 l capacity and a 88 kW force.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would look down on the family five doors.
It is silent, consume little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the škodas of that time that seemed as if the exhaust tube was covered by a cloth, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 per 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it has the additions of the team in the Fabia and will reach a fairly similar number.
Now we have to decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools and, therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and tantrums between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was hitting a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist-tone insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two minor girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls slapped him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began spitting at us.
When I told him to let him do it, he made us the practice of throwing apples and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools starts to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
palm trees and everything enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea Island you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island is there much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards had taken from America and brought to Europe.
And then the American time came.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 1920s.
He ordered him to build one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore banned) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita they left their signatures the stars of the world of show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abanense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel, the cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those cars already in worship of the 1950s, so far they continue to work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even when Havana, in particular the ancient neighborhood is deteriorating noticeably, there are not many wonderful colonial monuments around it as well as there.
Other places were metamorphous in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly valued by railroad lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories by narrow routes in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for tens of years have not been discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose fraternal models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that reason, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in Hemingway's aforementioned estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they must not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on soils of limestone rock.
Mogotes, limestone pilns and steep rocks in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rockets are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is grown, probably the highest quality tobacco in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure habanera plants can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone seems interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad
Old town abolango that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who later arrived, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that joined it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places around such as Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the west end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed on its own path.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pure, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicala, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all this could be filled up many pages.
However, as it is said, it is best to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American defence minister Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of troop-contributing countries in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement flourish today, the eight participating states discuss plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to pursue greater activity, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone," said BBC station Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, the fourth of whom are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit as for the organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We'll have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we'll achieve them," Gates said.
Today, too, NATO Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, spoke in a similar sense.
"I am not glad to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's a little bit," De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Whoever's passive
Among the countries present in recent months, the controversy is that all allies do their utmost in Afghanistan.
On the basis of passive criticism, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as in our, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vaguely.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159,200 million crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns by improving the evolution of the state budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic grew to 842.7 billion crowns in late September.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, it has decreased 13.4 billion crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its debt data on the early October state.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the State owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year, we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz server, the economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees this: "We could pass the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene had changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
Doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns.
The external debt for now has grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of State debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to third quarters creates 13 percent what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is primarily generated from the obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It's bad that debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it's going to negotiate until there's a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
The state debt and debt management strategy for 2007 was drawn from the government's plan this year to lend 159,200 million crowns.
In early December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152,800 million crowns as a result of improved state budget developments.
The amount is, above all, made up of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, 43 billion crowns for financing the state's obligations and 1,800 million crowns for payments of the European Investment Bank's loans.
I was comparing today before a court to Jartúm for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan to insult Islam was convicted on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm 15 days in prison and the expulsion, his lawyer indicated.
The British was accused of letting 6-7-year-olds give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when every representation of the Prophet of Islam is unlawful.
It was a penalty for whipping.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School of Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday in her home and indicted for attack on Islam and sediation, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed " the principal of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of every 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the bear's picture with the caption " My name is Mohamed ".
The bear himself did not bear any labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that he asked the children to vote for a name " , it's only an " innocent mistake " .
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " she never talks about religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name most given in Britain, is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
An agreement on the future status of the province was not reached on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished a sixth and final discussion session in Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not anticipate violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, pointing out that "obvious tensions exist ".
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated at 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika was in charge of a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
The United States and Europe consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked independence in Kosovo from the Security Council, insist on the pursuit of negotiations beyond this date.
" Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found ", announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these " negotiations of the last opportunity " have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of Kosovo's rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has been part of his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was part of a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered a compromise to be always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia " , said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: on the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the West.
Bush starts an Israeli-Palestinian agreement
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he himself met on Tuesday to Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
It was stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old litigation between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must stop its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides of its obligations with regard to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main pelagic problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
Going back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the coming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the end of his " vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States " coexisting.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to this direction by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace for Israel in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , estimates Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate-General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 pm, Luisa-Miguel Street, at Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without rotating light," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to drive on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the ceda the step to the right," the police needed.
The control of alcoholemia on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the front part disfounded, rough windshield, torn parachutes) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary murder and denial of aid " to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that IGPN's investigation at this stage ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the police version, namely that this minimum totocycle arrived relatively quickly to its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the fruting of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed the time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious misconduct " concerning this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, on which one must be very prudent," said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of your windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We come down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw " a policeman completely terrified, who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone. "
Faced with the tension surrounding the scene quickly, and it seems, to the certainty that the people present the unexpected situation of the young, the police have been taken by their colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the reliefs arrived " about twenty minutes after the march of the police officers " .
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that police services did not bring assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor underlined.
Tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been sued.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (norwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of urgency and the waste to whom they swore an oath in front of Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise no longer meets "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of derogation declared on Saturday afternoon.
It had to be delivered in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court judgements " , the judge declared The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " is no longer valued " after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday to the assistant minister of Tariq Azeem Information.
It was expected that he would leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unintended
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36 %) pregnancies are not expected, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception, such as the pill or sterileet, still have a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better " fertility domain " according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women between 20 and 44 years of age has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
He will have needed more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew colleagues at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to their duration, their distance from the living modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuceed" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece that was soon to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a solar panel-powered power generation module, already present in the ISS, with a view to putting it in its final position.
After displacement, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a width of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a wire that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who had at first made a control exit of the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go snail at the end of 30 meters of length of the teledirect arm of the launcher added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been charged with "operating" the "inherited" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the faulty cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had remained close to the air lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-basket of insulated hockey to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapuceed" by astronauts aboard the station.
Upon completion of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday evening, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently down to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its forecast of operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of reducing the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion of which more than €1 billion for Airbus " , announced the parent house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more accurate accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new burdens is consistent with the delay of six months.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another programme, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery from the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putine, Russia united.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about public chains, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to hand over a new burden against the West accused of interference - his topic of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far away from the truth.
It denounces a pressure-mangled campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Zioganov says there is never ever had such dirty elections, until the Eltsin era.
After the crackdown on last weekend's demonstrations, the former World Jaque champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, is banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two more open questions:
Who will happen to Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative elections as well as in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel owned by their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada independent center.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, went further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic eviction " , says María Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " willingly renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had recently given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What should I reflect for?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, neither will they vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? ”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consulted only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his legal guardians.
The 11 States in charge of their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for searches " particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the public opening of these nominees because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or the mental scarf of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war in a practical way: to find the nationals deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest to a part of the scientific community.
" There is nothing fundamentally new that needs to be expected from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University Technische in Berlin, declared in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now nearly EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free-trade agreement in 2008, said the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The Foreign Ministers of the European Union had given their approval in April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will do tremendously both economies " and " India will improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. Asian and European giants change annually to " €47 billion of goods " and to " ten billion of services " this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for its eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at the base rate of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its planned provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , says in a statement.
The bank specifies that £10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market so on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10th.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain interbank lending rates per day in line with its baseline index.
The interbank rate per day was on Wednesday 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was set at 6.6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with an important penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the pound change over the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the European Central Bank's market, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of the PS Party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouvelle Centre group refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to a rejection of the text.
The text was part of a socialist 'nice' (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), which declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including an increase of 50 % of the employment surplus, the re-establishment of the Fleet Domestic Petroleum Tax, a cheque-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of Articles (180 to 115), the meeting was held at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes live, between a majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The head of MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the Bill of Correctional Finance discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Republic Festival of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," told Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republican Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republican Festival created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as a " most inspiring event " to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked persistently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of the city of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-grade policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that recently took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the landscape of festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours is being held rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression to the European and urban way to the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very big", such as that of the 80 000 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the rock taste, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 comrades who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the duties of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"It must be prudent, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The race for festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is, however, the promotion of cinema here.
The Oskares race has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and ensure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in a poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally in stock? Experts, divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks to dismiss the closure of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, the month of December in stock exchange usually has positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties affect markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of taking the alley bag in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the fledgling effect to quality values both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the probable decline of Fed types is not known, given the high level of crudeness and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, sales manager for BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"There's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4 per cent from the peaks marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Yet not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert regrets that things will be something different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a bounce of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the United States on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of values that will be the ones who will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it's about great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
In the meantime, Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco ensures that the climbs will come from the bank and from the industrial sector.
Constructors may also benefit from this rally, if any.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their same path," the expert explains.
The cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a Bajista month.
The real rally at the end of the year was in 2003, the exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the cutting of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent relay.
You will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (for the time being Ibex rises by 8.36 per cent since January) and if you can count on your rally at the end of the year.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew most of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular Max brand, represent for the bank a great change.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and to open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedule of its branch offices, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the People's experience will be crucial for other entities to focus on this second trade time initiative.
This is precisely the goal that popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move around these areas to carry out their purchases, to SMEs, autonomous and street businesses chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling the existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize branches that already have in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers from different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The head of the commercial bank, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not entail a major investment, even if more staff are hired, since some six employees per site are changed to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be with success, according to Rivero.
The population currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
At these PopularMax premises, they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with outside staff at the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the value in Bag of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain that ran doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect of her joy was: 'It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' she said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday the day with an advance of 2,54%.
This gain places its loss on what we have spent each year at 15.66 per cent.
The value in Stock of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His opponent Antena 3, who gave in to 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a downturn of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (the Five-Day Editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we cost it in terms of hearing'.
Telecinco announced last week that it is planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1. billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa, the subsidiary managing the group's advertising.
If this information was made real, the television channel would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million of the financial year 2006.
For its part, Antena's net billing increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already given value to 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing certain fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the cut in expected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability by dividing and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Box Madrid: see Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintener) for the 'multiple attractions' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends in both cases to be infringed by having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective that both of them will enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best rules in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of entities to ensure that markets operate efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, is the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encourages cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial service signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial instruments operations, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and orders internalisation systems, which will compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all operations they carry out, to facilitate supervision by CNMV.
In its passage through the Commission on the Economy of Congress, several amendments were incorporated, among which it highlights that debt securities are considered as a financial instrument "complex" given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be performed by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the Royal Decree delimiting professional functions reserved for economists was passed in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of CNMV and will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and for the collection of customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to match the final data, which will be made known on the next 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise in IPC 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the Congress halls that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We were hoping for a figure about 4%," the Minister of Economy has acknowledged regarding the advance figure today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have dropped more than 50% to £12 billion (16.800 million) since it broke into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, record deposits were piled above £25,000, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee for that money offered by the Government and which will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the target of 30 billion.
The group of the magnate Richard Branson, known for his remarkable advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested mayor of Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) in the early morning today for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot established this week.
In addition, one of the secretariats of the Consistory and the Chief of Police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then director of the municipality, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Agents continue to register municipal units and the Urbanism Council and no further arrests are dismissed within the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' counsel has been charged, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption that was uncovered earlier this week.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore outlawed, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the purpose of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy by Toledo and to chair Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list by Toledo for the forthcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in the press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting that was held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
Moreover, he has pointed out that "yes it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on 15 November his decision not to present himself to the next general elections and to leave his career in active policy to fight climate change in the university.
The former minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he should return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He has also pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "home of respect and not of insult or scream." and make it "more and more look like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and with rest is Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good doing" and has not wanted to see him already occupying his position so as not to fall into what he has pointed out his opponents might see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to persecution both by the sceptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, in what sectors has occurred, and why has not been avoided by his Government, the government of the contract with the planet.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to explain with the utmost clarity what measures will be taken to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits must be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences will be.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has never been or there will be those explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costumes, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerously electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that he does not speak or denounce nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move by bicycle or cool with the fan.
The mayor and chief of the local Totana Police were arrested for a alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a tenant entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have reported sources of the investigation today.
The building was arrested at home and has been transferred to the Consistory, whose units are currently located with numerous agents, who have also attended the Town Council and the municipal management company of the Land and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galicia Nuaria company to build 4,000 houses, after payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought to court today.
According to sources, the former governor of Totana and today MP for the PP, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, like the current girlfriend of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Immonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Civil Guard Central Operational Unit (UCO) Group of Urban Crimes, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven records, most in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

If it seems to you, let us let the Book of the Month rest, see if there is another ‘premiology’ and other competences in the meantime.
I'm already perchating something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way in the head of the PISA report on education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, on the same day that there was curious criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet discharge offences:
A. The download of a song would be a crime of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal records in the store for less than EUR 400, it is simply deemed to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the tax on discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty continues to be lower than that of the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous kidney has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than dropping a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films by the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague's right, someone's going to get his hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor takes me long one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings that the workers' monthly pay generates depend on what their peers earn.
The study has been carried out through tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
Researchers observed that if both were right, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if it took so much science to conclude this.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly chasing Balkan war criminals since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague for eight years.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agriculce flavor, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former general Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain free.
His names are on that list from which he takes his title the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla' (2006), not premiered in Spain, who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to persecute the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What are you sure I'm okay with?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the car, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is reflected in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the carne, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or use by the car, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the cost to pay.
That is why both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of unestrality due to their prudence.
The companies have also concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percency.
As the frequency increases, the odds are increased.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation carefully to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, it will offer a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a number of disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, there are other more cost-effective options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would imply that the customer pays part of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the amount of the sinister that the customer provides will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be the lowest the amount," says Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in First Europe Spain, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is secured protection from damage caused to third parties, even if not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the sinisters as much as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basis.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can be allowed to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old strip drivers have it easier to hire insurance, since the index of unestrality is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to hire a full risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when dealing with an accident, and even at the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but has no children yet, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation permits, of course he is.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with lower rates of unestrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (possibly that of EUR 300), or, where a high rate of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of taking on a greater amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to take all risk insurance with franchise (which is EUR 150), or one to third parties enlarged when they have a high degree of bonus.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to study adequately the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic is looking for a point worth eight in Milan.
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the champion league, as the Italians serve to be first and Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives the Benfica, which has four, does not carry it forward.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to fight the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on 13th in semifinals in search of a square for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and would ensure a better crossing in eights.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could serve even a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at nine points equal the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
So, the Milanists will try to make the Scots bitter at night, who trust to get into eight for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the trip.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the victory, in the event that he loses Celtic, both to get into eights and to continue at UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert on the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brightful".
About 20,000 people exhausted the entrances to witness the concert that included a video that recounted the history of the group that made rage at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Vooooo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience who had crowded GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the fifth two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, they were expected by an army of babysitters.
Of the five, seven children come.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California, U.S.A., San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (5-7th December).
They will be in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of affecting the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rocket between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute prior to last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolistic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine might pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters News Agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of traffic rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record of employees from outside Europe, said a vigilante.
The recommendation of General Auditor Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed its concern that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign staff it has.
However, his report noted other controls carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the amount of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, as a result of the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi physician at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep on the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged bombings in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The general auditor's report recommends, inter alia, that the boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign personnel."
BMA President Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what value is added to the recommendations made," he explained.
Scottish health authorities declare that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number can be higher, partly because the boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out widely.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualifications check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and guide of pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
The Health Secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, stated: "It was of great interest that this work would be carried out following the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates Film Awards · Global Voices
Control, the biographical film about the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award to the best film.
The trophies also gave themselves to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal."
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the Variety Award to put a British film on the international stage.
The prizes were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to the reputation of Curtis with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film -in black and white - that has the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But also winner was Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded with two awards - to better director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The prize to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian Mafia in London, in the film of David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50th, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently film the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of Crystal Skull".
Winston said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
The awards for independent cinema, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell activists planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the largest oil supplier in the world said that one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have waged a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, reported the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed attack on Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said that militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis who travel to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the Allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunies.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as objectives foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, for five months at work," the Minister of the Interior spokesperson said to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "the Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing financial support and support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the Earth's future
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, declared scientists yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like a twin of Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by stormy winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Physics Department of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It's clarifying why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when it's two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police seized "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was uranium enriched but said it could have been sold for $1 million ($480.000 sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is unworthy that the presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency may agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters and currents record video questions and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday evening 28 November were more ridiculous than the snow monkey that asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in front of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, co-sponsoring the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-on-one issue, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas that they would like: the emitters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The most difficult exchange of words at night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of toxic toys in China and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became awkward when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble on the position that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, now against all expectations, first of all in the latest survey of Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, the Laughter said that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two have come out of the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
No influence seems to have been sold, nor are these exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor are extramarital fingers sucked.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has made contributions to the English labor party, of over 650,000 pounds sterling (US$1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister chose to call an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has changed from being Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative hat.
A three-thirds of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
It is now the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably on his way out.
Governments may reach a point of inflection after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials are starting to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I'd like to deny Tony Blair, it was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions Brown made as a director of the era.
And even though it is not directly involved in Blairish's counter-times - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been cheated directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but he does not make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fundraising to whom he was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these proceedings, even though the bulk of payments was made after he had taken control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making on a family matter, a committee of inquiry into the matter - largely led by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of the police.
Furthermore, there are other things Mr. Brown should do, like finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require the hard cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to win is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins are born excited around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis suppresses other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion you can see.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of undepreciated or over 30 days late, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in charge of its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morosity and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in fees can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of persons (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of lateness) would be growing again, or may happen that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are falling.
But credit card issuers look more at the liquidity flow than the active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the lending capacity of borrowers.
They can even work to conjure the emitters.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing mortgages will decrease if properties are less than the loan value; and as a result, card debt payments are on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or changing credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retaliation.
"We're not gonna wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and credit contractions push America to recession, industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who tried their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for collapsing with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of the employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of U.S. district, each was convicted of fraud collision.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kipper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a company of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped their spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests at zero, but the three British knew it would be valued at rise.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers paid 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges at the collapse of Enron.
The three-year British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of fraud in accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business failing appear successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with reos last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Fier, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one wants that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents."
Mr. Fier was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, an orgy of four days of consumption held in a centre of events in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract new Russians wealthy into all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in caoba to the diamond-enriched car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the next stand to his own."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplied with fuel by the rise of oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was at his feet.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some well-known Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, the rich second grade include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think think think.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, some15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London Jewellery.
She attends the fair for the first time next to the Russian brand distributor, Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are perfectly prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in late costume, two agents of real estate, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who re-elegated off the design suit that he used as a veteran dye network diszing with Joan Rivers.
The purpose of the fair is to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum quartz, Mövenpick ice creams, pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears in Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting on a stand of the Dutch Royal Porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, salesmen said that the richest Russians with the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the brands of limited editions, which would not be exposed at a commercial fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, millionaires or tourists emissaries, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, General Director of King Koil Beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, in charge of sales for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170.000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car pairs in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in colour crystals Swarovski, so that he resembled a roller wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, won't necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Non-millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone cabins (British style) filled with stacks of fake bills of $1 million.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on lots of money, or wrapping up a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
"chapuza" surgery could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, there was a car from the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I heard someone died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Av.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test even if the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that is hanging on the top ranks of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo had been assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said the house was near 3 P.M.
From November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
It was declared dead in the place.
It has been over a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door in Mrs Castro's home, where a marchito rosal is located in the front of the house, and a dalemata bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the door of the cab, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch this one or that one," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's embarrassing."
It is expected that the federal reserve will cut rates to raise the Stock Exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions with interest rates, which were increased with the tranquilizing comments of the vice president of the central bank of the United States.
The scholarships were held in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, President of the Reserve, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing credit exchange samples, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement in late September and October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets and to make subsequent cuts of interest rate, to stabilize credit conditions.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as the sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total labour force, in an overall cost reduction to compensate for losses of its investments in US subprime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close of 13.289.40, while the S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to the closure of 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of Britain's first-order companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was over 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit tension in markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, stressed the credit and the three-month "Libor" loan rates among the British banks, meant the largest increase since September, of 6.59 per cent, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England Judges Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit England #6 in Kandy this weekend, Owis Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important in the face of the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's desk, director of England, is beginning to fill up offers to become a national selector, and if not, on a part time.
The one who does not get the sixth bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport also.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than by ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, they would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to grasp the Captain's eye while taking a "wicket" and a drummer to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who would probably play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared himself to fit and bowls like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each trial and did well in the first ones, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to settle at the same time who became a major player, and despite recording a double hundred against Australia in Australia, it can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of them.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of the 88th in Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races on his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his home as Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" some momentum that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He caught up with nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flew his vehicle in an exhibition for the British car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was bring out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say with excitement: "Did you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it is including its rhizome pass to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who were left without cash, without extensions of the visa and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni physician.
"I returned today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he states, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to stop temporarily.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped Al-Qaeda out of its bastion to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging the citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops grew up groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many stated that they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave a voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nuuri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until Al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring about sectarian tensions and the struggle will begin.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international guidance of its higher schools.
As in the whole of the country, the Scots lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftyth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic motion on himself from the smallest federal state for his fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system that in a study by the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was merged in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillaryate.
"The system of vocational education is exploited in the Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Economics Institute (IW).
More than five young people make their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced the higher schools to advertise more for the engineering science specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether students have increased their performance.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late school development students decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Sarre didn't get much better as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they can achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez lets change the schedule in the South American country by delaying the half hour clock.
Presently Chávez is staying like a comic in Spain.
As reported in the Venezuelan State Official Gazette, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
Thus, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed on his day the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the action with hostages.
Left nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", it's the phrase that's already downloaded half a million people.
This sentence was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by the leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
The experts present a great deal of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the rise in value added tax and the pull-out of food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomy and Research of Economic Cycles.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be for employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent over a year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German Social-Democrat Party politician.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the rate of inflation with price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3 %.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most like the Earth, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and rubble in the poles, the same ones that also appear in the winter on the Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays run from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the Venus surface there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface are 500°C temperatures, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin of the Earth, but he remains a twin," said Russell.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so much like the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers' opinion, stress not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had imagined," the ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds the windflows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piconi of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called sunrise star or evening star orbits around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its 92 bar atmospheric pressure is not much like the Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had become crowded that remained on Earth in the oceans, but in Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth had become carbon stones, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insisted on ending the match between the parties for the Dalai Lama reception in the Federal Chancellorship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democrat Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end this fight for the Dalai Lama reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, he stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received when undertaking a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional Una China policy course.
China also knows that," said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its unimpeded foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellorship caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbreeck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Chief of Government, demanded that the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Fighting with police on the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
The vandals were barricaded and shot at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We need to be aware that our country's social problems do not take the form of violence."
"That we have to take seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It is still early to sit down at the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same edificatory and sociological problems as in France.
The young people were involved in serious riots on the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolose.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded more efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an impersonative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
More vocational training posts have to be taken care of.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"You must provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a light helicopter overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolose.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the death of young people was not because of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far away from the Federal Chancellor's reality, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that there is no need to expect anything more from it.
But what country does the Chancellor live in?
After her desperate, indifferent and unconcerned performance in the general debate of the Lower House, we must say: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
With regard to the criticism he was subjected to repeatedly being devoted to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive sentence.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was made very clear to all that such criticism was appropriate.
There could be no minimal interest, no feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Ángela Wolke presented himself this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: climate change prevention: it was very much praised for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow so much modesty.
Well, he's committed to expressions to get people an impulse.
And thus damage your public image by the pragmatic conception with which you solve the problems without leaving the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are low-value appearances.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-paid workers?
The only thing you do is talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It starts tripping "as if it had been in an unknown territory," when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, confronted a heated debate of Republican presidential pre-candidates on YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have already been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have turned New York into "a haven for illegal immigrants."
This, for his part, replied with grave reproach: "I want to say that his own home was a "port" for the illegal." Giuliani answers to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group has no clear preference, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, do not have much content.
"With this isolation we let Hitler come to power," John McCain reproached his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding ", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown in death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important themes of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded when praising conservative values and denying the rise of taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," explains Romney, composed and apologized to the people and the television audience for being an abortion defender in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's the end of the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his military chief's mandate to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the United States.
Eight years after power was made with an incrusted military coup, the former general for the first time ruled the state as a civilian leader.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there were many supporters of Musharraf. Last week, the Supreme Court of the country rejected all remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North-Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s is still active: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a reestreno was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written at the best time of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the feeling.
Each of them has before him its box, its cables and above all its buttons.
In the middle is sat Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his or her sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band was making music again.
What is to rebel here is the following: the precise questions have shown that the band's name was falling back on people's minds, but it wasn't something as special as that after 32 years the audience would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of the Can 2003 band in Cologne for their work of life, they could see the surprising faces of German pop artists in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Roth spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the three existed only two years and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Roth had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973, Roth followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, a Bander of Association of Otenstein's Harmony Song appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griesem. Someone recalls that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
So Roth expressed his desire to promote harmony and to do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on esoteric themes and assured his existence with albums like "Flamende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia had since.
The live album recording in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company set itself as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was rediscovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by the special music fills the hall: "This music is the only true music, to it belongs the future."
There are pictures where Harmonia shows up with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where you see instruments with cables.
At the bottom are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is just as it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere he coughs, whispers, and at a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
It was not looking for the origin of the genre in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever's here is shouting "68!" he's right, too, but harmony now keeps calm.
In the scenario you think very well about what is already obvious.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
That can break one's nerves or give you some quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Or the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkan mountain, but just there, in the dark interior of the country during the war in Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was rediscovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the prettiest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his nice roles and of little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the movie titles have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and industry of the cinema had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decade was still preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to love her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm out Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was actually never a good movie about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story of American reporters in the war going to detect a criminal war Serb called "zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that can't be done by the army and every time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they do not let him simply be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian who will later kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's heads hunters could not achieve, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to get revenge in a fair way.
It is so bad, that they urge to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human being.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and points out that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to the head a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In the movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the gender of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all of the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fias.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star goes through a region of crisis or the mines, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred within a short time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood asks for a good movie about the holocaust, taking as an example the film "The Schindler's List".
Some films already need more time. Classics like the war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
Whether or not they were or the great dictator were so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that so bad was actually the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic look away from an artist.
When they asked him about the parallelisms between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he said, "That is only because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympic Games.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that it is necessary to be realistic when estimating possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city has encouraged as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, we could not maintain the political, sporting momentum at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympic Games were not to be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Federation for Olympic Sports," von Beust says at WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) which is expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we have so far thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have any chance."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to give up the chance, if the plans are ruined right now," said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement made by the Senate head at a reception at the General Meeting of the German Public Federation for Sport of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as a "replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the Federation of Sport of Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democrat Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) appealed to the Senate not to take advantage of the time so valuable for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed with the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, MPs of the German Social-Democrat Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games sparked a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Those who relate the terms Sweden and the wooden box, think of Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" "bright box" on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museet Museum of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the Modern Museum Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of the "Stocolmo type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that they had soap dust "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works of 1968 at the Modern Museum Museet were exposed hundreds of carton-blanks. These did not make them Warhol (because of the costs), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only some objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed Sweden to produce some wood-boxes, but they were not exposed at the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Stocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén Museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died 3 years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the private Swedish property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and crushed their tight silvers and then painted them to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roll without printing directly the pressed silvers. Moreover, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Light Boxes," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museet and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which these are soap dust boxes.
But from then on everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had enlisted in a hotel in Manila were surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The loyal soldiers to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been intertwined a few hours ago in the building.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the Thursday trial for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
It took advantage of the negotiations, so that it could suddenly be deposited with some 30 sympathizers.
Obviously, the military policemen who were supposed to watch him had moved on to their ranks and followed their riots.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Councillor, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People are flat," Trillanes said.
"We invite people to move on to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite army Scout Reangers, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great government critics called on Thursday a major demonstration against the president.
His government has been reproached for corruption for months.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours for the army to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versailles.
United Internet ensured more than 20 percent of the actions of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
It's only 20.05 percent of the capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options to further increase the financial share of Versailles.
United Internet reported that with this step, it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (digital subscription line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its participation to the network operator of Duesseldorf by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains the participation securities for a third partner.
United Internet already on the previous day took part with almost 10 percent in the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch to the extent of capital expansion placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies began with negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," said the spokesperson for United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP company together, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be content with the participation of ten percent of Freenet and do not use their right, i.e. they participate in 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant both companies kept all the options, especially participation in the freenet anonymous society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet holding and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to make the other four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
