Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about “seeming muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly are bewildered by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This uncertainty arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that I should stay with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means caca.
A member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "de discontent" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party claimed that his group was "open" to a change of name, but noted that MWP's leap of pronunciation to muppet was small.
In this context, the wording of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of Yorkshire's letter or English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of Members of the Assembly shall be a matter of its own members."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option gained most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly appear to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should be sending the bill on change in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disabling of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of what they should call when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's change of name
Voters will vote on Sunday about whether their country's name will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of San Martín keep quiet because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's neither one thing nor the other."
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"Now people socialize in another way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors go regularly."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the sanctuaries that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and, therefore, will speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation was in the 1930s of the 20th century.
A black congregation that rendered worship close to bought the building.
A black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street merchants 125, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in San Martín, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the carriage called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, pointed out that he was the world's first coach used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who went to play Riverside Church's biggest coach 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the secular leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, commenting on its concern that the diocese "seek to pass costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California the day the lobster season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that "he was shouting that he had been bitten

He had the clavicle broken," he observed Hammel when he came near the child.
"I begged everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel said.
The child was transported in helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press conference that saw a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to the Swami beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plans Promote the United Kingdom's Beauty Market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their stylish and beautiful establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with growth going up compared to the fall of fashion sales and household cleaning, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will do the same in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household household cleaning.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also restart its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something more and more demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will test your concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly inaugurated in Croydon, in southern London, last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the shift to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local shops force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has stated that shops will look more and more like shopping malls while the chain of supermarkets tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount establishments offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted the sales of edible and profitable more these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues from the sales points of pharmaceutical products into their supermarkets.
The new strategy is developed following the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "furiate" after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "hot" after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke an agreement of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly accessories.
This business had compared to the Gwyneth Peatrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced that she was abandoning the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative life-style business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furiate" when the TV gold girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double the fortune of Willoughby, of about 11 million pounds.
While 37 - year - old Willoughby announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his vacation homes.
As one source consulted commented: "Truly was, differently, Holly's main priority.
It was to be your long-term future, which would keep you in the next two decades.
His decision to quit left all the involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a store full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready to put on sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the major investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and possibly further delay their launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said that last night "there was no talk about business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a little presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice as a "newsreader."
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the US continues to impose sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded stadium, we would have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing out to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move, there was no national emergency, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not apply for international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," says Mrs. Suungu.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo converted the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has devoted a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing a re-election next year.
It must also address the pressure of the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the marker in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the minute 89 on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri a little over 27 meters from Chelsea door when the marker was 1-0.
He put the ball in his left foot with a touch before throwing it into the second pole.
The action directed it over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell on the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave her a touch. I didn't think too much, I just fired the shot."
Chelsea was going to win 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the minute 25.
The Blues midpoint made a tacón pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning on a stream near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle field.
Then he made a beautiful pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball to the second post network with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will take place at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country ' s emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday, and that unleashed waves of up to six metres, said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, which assumed the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to come to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend that anyone, especially the taxi drivers, have been able to pick up something in Dashcam to contact us, since they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and found within a property.
This afternoon some people who believe to know the woman came to the scene of the crime to know where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He became perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to enter again within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was treating himself as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cord and one more outside.
Several agents were standing inside the cord controlling the block of floors.
Any person with information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewrite history"
His prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "intent to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell of Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The iconoclastia of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice himself to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of the view of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese herd
A pig attacked and killed a herd in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a well of the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou, as reported on Sunday by South China Morning Post.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder is prepared to inject pigs from a pocilga in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby well was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig nearly 250 kilos had attacked the herd until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin, who is headed for his last name, "Wu," to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed their pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was closed to stop him from attacking anyone else, while the police picked up evidence on the spot.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Even though they're weird, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man wounded of gravity.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 kilos ran to a farmer in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten at an Oregon herd, a Manitoba herder told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disparatizer".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rain widespread in the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all north of Mexico and southwest of the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday to 5:00 in the morning (East Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which are moving eastward to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to boost the intense tropical rains in the north, towards the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure approaching, there will be heavy rainfall widespread in the south-west over the coming days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture in the desert on foot.
The strong rains could turn the cannons into rivers that are enbroidered and storms will cause rusty winds and clouds of dust locally.
The low pressures approaching will leave heavy rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to two centimeters of water, which could cause small debris flows and make the roads rock.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and first hour of Monday, before the rain is generaled at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will spread to the Four Esquinas on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense changes in temperature in the U.S. may be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this implies drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a warm beginning of October is expected, with widespread temperatures that will circle 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average, could be reached in New York.
Our long-term forecast indicates high temperature probabilities above average for the eastern US during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the overwhelming testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued to standstill and the media disrupted their usual programming to broadcast the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake, to get the FBI to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that she tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football match of the playoffs or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, a great interest continued to be shown.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement informing that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras captured how protestors shouted at him when he tried to get a lift to attend a court hearing.
As he received these complaints, transmitted live by the CNN, he was shot dead.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would count more in his presence to the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting television channels broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidature to the Senate to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated charges made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the talks he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The first British minister, Theresa May, arrives in Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for brexit, claiming that one proposal for Britain and the EU to collect the other's tariffs was "all absurd".
Wayde's Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death · Global Voices
The police arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree homicide, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police pointed out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, WAFB, CBS subsidiary reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Instruction Judge of Baton Rouge District This published a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound on the neck that had come to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitives unit, the State Police criminalistic laboratory, the Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU sports, thanked the police forces in the area for his "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
It had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a departure from the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, basketball coach at LSU, declared his team "devasted" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade said.
A ashes dump volcano in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has arrived in the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several earthquakes and shakes.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico's center in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the riots while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coincidering with the first anniversary of the polarized referendum in Catalonia on the secession.
A group of hooded separatists to whom the antidistorts had cut the passage threw eggs and powder painting, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours, and the police used pores to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independent groups, with messages such as "not forgotten or forgiven", faced unionist protesters with the cry of "Liva España".
Fourteen people were treated for mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
The voters elected independence by overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as the persons against the secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempts to prevent voting at polls throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy in being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital, albeit narrow victory in the regional elections of last December, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been revived by politicians on both sides.
"He's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after repeatedly getting used to a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that they caused damage to the accesses and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a bullet.
A Menga attack grants 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as a coach at the Iberox Club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's ones went up a post, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard's men have not yet won any wins out of the house and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Before, the Rangers received the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his six-game victory race. Holt, the lead coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston leaves opportunities in front of an overwhelming visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the door. Later, Alan Lithgow was shot astray after he was hospitalized to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the door.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to visitors with the ball-playing games.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an entrance, with a combined play of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and set from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn't pass the host's defense and the doorman, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continues to the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, Rangers' porter rejected Scott Pittman's shot of a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston play.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always cleared. Two criminal requests were rejected, one after a Hallett entry on alternate Glenn Middleton and one by one hand.
Livingston "phenomenal" (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they did an excellent game that continued to overcome the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
His style of play and his staff have hardly experienced changes since his ascension, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was enormous and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerard, they stayed short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the field opposite once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday September 29 there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations among NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterward, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers stood in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurdish, were also heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These manifestations reflect how divided this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran off to Childers Street, almost two kilometers from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut down and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and affect a pavilion.
The officers were assisted by minor injuries to the face at the site.
A prison spokesman commented: "Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received injury health care.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
Long Lartin ' s prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (rid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early in the week that comes when the latest collections of Hurricane Rosa crossed the southwest of the desert, at the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada and southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression on a radius of 321 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Hurricane National Center provide between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarve, in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places where there is no risk of sudden flooding, Rosa's rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the conditions of drought that are currently being experienced in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported atweather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit the peninsula of Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and travels north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected that it will recede in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Strong torrential rains could fall in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"We expect torrential rains between 7 and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching the 25 cm", as reported atweather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Subsequently, she will travel to Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," says the Hurricane National Center.
These rains are expected to cause sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old had been found with white gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18 and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who could have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the "Americans saw the cunning, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the legalists with more achievements of today, a jurist with an admirable history at the service of the public," he told his followers in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"Five weeks to go for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, reported a high position of the leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged through the huge waves that swept through the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported on Saturday by the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its acronyms in Indonesian) in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, blew up everything on the ground," said Nugroho. The tsunami had been displaced by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the ruined buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the officials claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social networks, a man was heard on the last floor of a building telling the people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, facing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities declare, but the evacuated persons still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has reopened to open itself for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under a canvas set up in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they'd seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while the aid groups launched disaster assistance gears, some people regretted that the displacement of highly experienced co-workers was not being allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only be used if the site concerned is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial catastrophe," said Auli Arriani, spokesperson for Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
At the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of those who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that brought some light to the desolate stories of natural catastrophes.
On Saturday a small child was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing paragliding players for the Asian Games, which had concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were their students.
"Because of my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to Palu competitors, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only one gray mark, not two blue.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves carry $26,750 during an automatic cashier recharge in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed a Brink employee who recharged an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, bringing $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic cashier located in the center of leisure and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy on the note.
While he was busy, another man "he got close to running behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag for recharging.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the premises, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Change His Name to Ye
Raper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
For some time now, in the 41-year-old West, he was nicknamed Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change arrives before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel his performance by "emotional reasons", as the program creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of this year as he spoke about the album title with the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers who has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator from West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were intensifying throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments later appear on the I.A. announcements from several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the US lacks a strategy of I.A. official.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicating the budget for research on I.A. would be a good start, since all other countries go a long way behind the US. We have our look at the next progress in the field of I.A."
Double funding means double the possibility that the next great achievement in I.A. is achieved in the U.S., as Lee declared in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editor Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that won the best American player in Othello. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave recognition to the previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to make a lot of effort to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired prominent people from universities to work in I.A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the US intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The China State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research by I. A.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday about whether their name would change to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has prohibited its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the required minimum 50% for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum paper asked the following question: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU joining the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to seek access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one afternoon, irregularities had not been reported.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last elections held in Parliament in 2016, when 66% of registered voters took their vote.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Macedonian prime minister, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko put their vote in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name for the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of the campaign shops planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter into Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO would provide the much-needed investment in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43% of the voters were going to participate in the referendum, which means less participation than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, dodges the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling rescinded Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the minute 65.
The Argentine mediapoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, it was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He escaped a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He took a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English front used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with the right foot to avoid porter Mathew Ryan with a shot that got to the right side of the network.
"Aguero has some problems on his foot," said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to journalists.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to score a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League count.
The goal arrived in the minute 29.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very inside the Brighton territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touches before heading to Sterling to the second pole.
Sky blues' front threw the ball to the net just before he left the limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take the party to the Rockies.
With the Nationals removed from the playoff count, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to step the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed before Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first title of division.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that Denver's audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't he want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and returned to his normal break on Sunday.

Trump's doing a West Virginia rally.
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when discussing the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we've done is at stake.
Five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a career, so I'm going from place to place fighting to get great candidates," he said.
And he continued, "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see meskinity, wickedness.
They don't care who hurts or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were angry, they were bad, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission appointing the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the mayors of the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you want to filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer, your body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour Party Members who are told that he is not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated like being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. It is ironic that they were matters in which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "most kind and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it actually applied at some time.
It is increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues he once thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect that he would change his mind radically and take positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diaspora of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing a stream of sexist or racist insults daily, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of views and, with each motion "of censure" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice that recommended keeping my head low and not making me hear so much and that it would be "good."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my whole school class literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councilman or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for someone in Nottingham East to ignore my political positions or areas where I did not agree with the current leaders.
All I would say to those who promoted the Friday motion is that I do not understand these desires to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country heads a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invicted Ayr climbs to the top
Two trials at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining party of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now they head the board and it's the only invict team of the ten who participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to make better use of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We've been tested in all the parties and we're still indicted, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than we."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the party, enabled Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot obtained an unconverted trial.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a penalty. Previously, just in the middle of time, he marked and became a solo essay, leaving the marker in 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to pull out in the shirt, and, after the game resumed, the Ayr advanced with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of another man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for plaqueing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a test when he was in the back of the maul that was moving forward.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the party resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent to the wing Gregor Henry at the bottom to get the fifth rehearsal of the premises.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to guide his career towards the sector of restoration
Ford Kieran, protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the catering sector after it turns out that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphilll.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craigang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "floating restoration market" of Glasgow.
"The Sea Belongs to Us": a landless Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors watch a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings waves marine blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing for a return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution from the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice resolution arrives only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the Bolivian cause, it may have been impeded for the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
He also suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "putting an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never renounce her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted in the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Norwegian Foreign Minister, says that his nation will never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if it cannot be trusted in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at a Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic talks in paralyzed nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to submit to the north is a "chemera".
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without making any significant disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, widespread scepticism prevails over Pyongyang's seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the representatives.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a street of shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or totally protect yourself from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric large hats for their 2019 summer spring collection on the walkway, dazzling the Paris Fashion Week style.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large additions were sands with jewels, a witch hat and even a pine, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seams.
One creation reminded a complete dive team, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
If you like big fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to look in shop streets.
The big hats arrive by hand stepping "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind this so impractical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation on the walkway: a beach bag as big as the bathing model that wore it.
The dark orange raffle bag, decorated with raffia flecks and a white skin wing, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer season 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
As the designer of famous Luke Armitage to FEMAIL commented: "The next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large complements."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a career of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by individual and collective successes gathered in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (CIS) are striving to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak a man in a language you understand, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to her in her tongue, she reaches her heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot depend solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the classification tables, being the highest approved rates in the independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
Data, collected from the 74 SCIS centres, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French, and 63% of those studying Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages because they consider them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At present, as a subject, languages are considered to be at the same level as the CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Competition Commission revealed that 17 % were attributed to the shortage of language skills for entrepreneurs in terms of the difficulties they faced in filling jobs.
Language skills are therefore increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities requiring languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last his whole life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. Furthermore, it was established that the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language education is now important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, independent schools can always choose from a number of languages provided by specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scotland's independent educational centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens to them in the future.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of fans who expect to see LeBron James debut in his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season to be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' reporter, Mike Trudell, posted on a tweet that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session early this week, James was asked for his plans for the six-party Lakers' pretemporary program.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-time parties to prepare for me," he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump's scheduled rallies for the next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to fill the pending vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to obtain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see it online via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearance of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who were tense because of allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left in wait an early vote of confirmation of the Senate for, at most, a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections to take momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that the next week's five rallies intend to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," Reuters told a Trump campaign spokesman who didn't want to give his name.
Programmed at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena Stadium tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as being covered in Pittsburgh's media," reported West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is falling behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team demonstrates that they dare to fight to keep the hope alive for individual Sunday matches.
After three individual sessions, the forsoms of Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of impulse is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost," Jordan Spieth said when the day was over.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind for the sake of being excited, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and preach with the example.
Guts of celebration rose in volume as his round advanced, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the party in the 15th was received with a similar scream, from those who transmit that they believe the American team hasn't been left out yet.
"What needs to be done to redouble the efforts and focus on the party," Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe wears four and nothing can hurt them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That crack and the way their energy flows with the public make it clear that these are the players to which you have to win on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched to Sergio García, the hero of the four balls in the morning, after forming a partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the ones they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a great advantage in front of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team dare to fight, something some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe is advancing by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe departs with a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods who saw himself in trouble, advancing four points in the Le Golf National classification.
The European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to shorten the distance.
The American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, his magnificent union served to defeat a disheartening Woods and the American novice Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who in the two Saturday matches had not highlighted too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourballs, again became Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwestern Paris, Europe did not have everything on its part.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2-1 win in front of Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4-3 in the forsoms after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a four-point difference in individual parties has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the trophy owner, only needs a draw to preserve it.
Although they have been the best seconds for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that they will first be unilaterally disarmed if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its confidence in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared to the Annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as quitting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will first be unilaterally disarmed."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-out denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapon.
Washington has also resisted calls for the smoothing of international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of termination of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chemera of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader to the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea leader in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in a similar stagnation."
Even so, Ri's speech tone was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to lead North Korea missiles to American soil after Trump's "evil president" on a suicide mission called Kim "a rocket man."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in advancing disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that further sanctions were needed until North Korea became denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, like U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, reported to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize the definitive and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed unanimous sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been progress, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced that its "requirements were that of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "related measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing Machist culture to study all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that college number one students in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of his class in the United States.
Their motivation to launch the course emerged after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students only slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, an icon on the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it's not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride for "during the night sailing" still exists and added that modern technology and increasing pressure to which students are subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good dream should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired to extend it to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal grave to Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression out of the house, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's untidy team from 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
They wanted to get their first home win since the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points away from the Hearts, demolished leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
The Menga attack took place minutes before the half-time and the Rangers' uninspired alignment was not at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, the Livingston goes up to the third, behind Hibernian for the difference of goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as the line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after, supposedly, someone threw an object from the visitor background.
Gerrard changed to eight of the headlines who won the match against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who pulled a point out to the Hearts last week and would have been pleased by the way his very organized team drowned the competitors at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga took a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs drew a deep flaw for Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out on the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there were more hopes than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been sentenced in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two shots to carry in the first half, but the former porter of Ibox, Liam Kelly, was barely in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the target marked in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep game of Jacobs' standing ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher cashed the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and spent it Menga to mark the goal.
On the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block him.
Even so, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halfett taking off one long pass after another.
Holt's could have gotten more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that didn't enter.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, demanded a penalty towards the end of the party after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the counter Geiger
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 when he was about to be 63 years old.
But the invention bearing his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how their ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung, or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded on a deck in favour of Trump with a MAGA cap after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was bullied in the Saturday Night Live study after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself to the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used his cap with the message Make America Great Again, began to despot against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and ask me how I might like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the sketch program by Matt Damon in which Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not retransmit, comic Chris Rock went up the recording of West's bronche on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that it had been wrong for him to wear that hat.
"They got in with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat.
They got in with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," said the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that "you were going to put on your superman layer, because that meant no one could tell you what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were received from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study remained completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West bewildered many when he went out to the stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: Thank you for resisting MACHEDUMBER."
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in BallyhackLove, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday in the Belfast Trial Chamber.
The D.A. will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Throne Game Star, Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, Throne Game.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that these on-screen roles often convey to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his tronos game partner, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that it seemed "very important" to him to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems to me pretty important right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can have part of the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any precaution or sequel to Tronos Game when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "a maple of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will take the lead in True West, Sam Shepard's theatrical work that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he's got out of Throne Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820 000 people in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were some 40,000 new cases notified.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which implies a change with respect to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in full practice, declared the Chinese health authorities at a congress in Yunnan Province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the China LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB group suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of his staff to leak data from Republican Party senators and asserts that it is "dangerous liars" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these accusations were prompted by commentators and "extreme right" websites.
"Taxes, lies and more vile lies," Waters commented on a Twitter post.
Reportedly, the published information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration took place at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not at all responsible for filtering this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement gave immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"Relieve this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the temper necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
You mustn't rebel.
You must not question the motives of the defendant.
You must maintain calmness and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the Waters reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of being too angry during the Thursday appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent charges”.
"We will make sure that the authors are found," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English: Again in Action. The parody of Rowan Atkinson's spy remains short
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit guineas in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is appropriate to do with this new delivery of the parody franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfying about how clearly outspoken we are the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes jumping and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put his leg for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation conceived for non-English speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to overthrow glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that guy who played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveling man and international represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there is one or two good moments.
I was delighted to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor while the propellers clashed against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into view, but humor remains quite short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises of "serial" films like 007 and Mission impossible add comical ingredients without problems.
Humour seems more directed to children than to adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd misadventures are not as clever and clever as Atkinson' silent jokes in Mr Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and corraled character who is seeing how his political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are at risk, you will have to resort to anyone who is withdrawn.
That has to be the torpe Johnny English, who now teaches at a lean school, although he gives off-the-job classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it's a spying academy similar to that of a rock school.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his suffering former Bough colleague, re-represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a multi-millionaire charismatic technology world that says he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they dress up as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, put the chaos out hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; and, in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
They were definitely used in depth in that last sequence, but, as funny as it may be, the whole continues to convey a somewhat childish sensation.
A fairly regular product.
As with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help wondering if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but covers five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to devote the savings obtained through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "would fit" in the plans and economic agenda of the party to tilt the country for workers.
This change to a week of four days has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take part in the changing economy.
Just as a high office of the Labour Party commented to The Sunday Times: The announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"You won't get one day for another, but the four-day workweek is definitely a question the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said, "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
The shadow minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "acquired" from companies providing public services.
Among the plans of the shadow minister is also the idea that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their participation, since a labor government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive property funds for which 10% of private sector companies' shares are to be allocated to employees, which would require annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and if they could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least one week's final vote for confirmation as Supreme Court judge and also raises the question of whether the outcome could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring out information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course, of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, had the allegation come out and asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, tagent."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I have already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and would overlook the charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the persons she has appointed have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where there is an impressive star poster for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay for a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved at the age of 12 to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it nothing more than a form of the so-called "clictivism", which is called the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim that world leaders will be able to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from their actions, of which, have already been disbursed or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executors based in the United Kingdom united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with their full potential." To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens' collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, having undertaken more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from interventions related to nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard way and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements have already achieved before and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will count on at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy to block Russia's energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from rocking markets, including the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the Russian alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the instance of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the best supplier in southern Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the seaways remain open and, in the case, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels," he warned while indicating that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to release Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, Trump administration members, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has at all times insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only economically motivated and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russia's Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The American stance has, however, been met with Germany's rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting that was recently held between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he will consider joining the presidential career after the elections in half a term.
During a presence at the City Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally for women to be among the leaders," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during a meeting at the City Hall and said he was "leading the country on the wrong path."
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke untapped about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
Thursday was published a survey in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that they should be present for the 2020 elections.
Some 58% of Massachusetts' "possibles" voters stated that the senator should not be introduced, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Some 32 per cent of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The survey expressed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since he returned, is well known by the other families who suffer from the effects of TEPT and other wounds with which our soldiers return," he told the public that he was gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is such respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to his country."
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, who interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, says Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy to the new United States policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum-seekers facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name has not been revealed in the "Grace v. Sessions" case that presented in August the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied his application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine made a few statements on Friday stating that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be failed by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the demand and, instead, this exception infringes that principle," is stated in amicus curiae.
The lawyers also stated in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "responsive to a necessary labour force".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People leaving their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a particular political opinion may seek asylum," said Sessions when it announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to address all the problems, not even all the serious problems, which people around the world face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of deaths in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few annulled possessions left to them in an effort to recover whatever is possible.
There are hundreds of people injured and the hospitals, also damaged because of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, rested on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous replicas, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when I told us about the violent earthquake he was living on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's pay supplement at the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-sale newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to get involved in the elections at the United States Congress on 6 November, something China firmly denies.
The accusation Trump made about Beijing's attempt to influence U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington-led campaign to pressure China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports on both sides.
China's countervailing tariffs applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, the Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is further intensifying this pressure with advertising publications in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish an announcement of payment at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few differing voices and no real reflection of the differing views that people in China may have on the worrying path that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China failed to offer to publish" his article, although it did not specify what newspaper it was about.
Analysts point out that Republicans are moving away from women before voting in half with the Kavanaugh debacle
As there are many reputable Republicans who are closing ranks for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there can be a fallback, especially by women, in the forthcoming elections to be held in the middle of the legislature.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to continue with the vote.
"In this kind of matter it's not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to stand in favour of the FBI's investigation is enough to calm the voters who are disgusted with this matter.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive MoveOn group, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the Senate gates were calling "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with the Kavanaugh candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes out of all odds," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, so is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who don't usually vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he had detailed charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a setback if Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former president of the National Republican Committee, earlier last week, reports NBC News.
"It's no longer just a question of the committee's vote or the final vote, not even if they sit on the bench at Kavanaugh; it's also about the way Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, but there are a few more who stand on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony in a definitive or probable manner, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitively or possibly.
In addition, 38 % claimed that he believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same to Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her when she was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project. A company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "on-line personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in the storage of personal data is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills needed so Solid can reach the whole world.
For the time being, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not you are going to introduce a radical change where all your business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite being launching Inruptt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergy from the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I have been honored in their home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been granted the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "great courage", moved the line forward before reaching a cannon with one hand and down to three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions that his grandfather carried out were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very entertaining."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be a part of the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is evident when he is shown such a great support."
The followers of the MMA were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay all night awake to see the entire Bellator 206 so that at the end don't let you see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was going to broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face, UK viewers were amazed when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having had to stay awake until early in the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication vice president of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they're going to modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
"When I think about the broadcast option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a large number of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we have usually done. We try to offer more than usual so that the amateurs were happy and we pass.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up to feel inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this in turn was what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us he didn't realize until he got to high school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention to talk about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made it begin to emphasize the fact of winning in the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be away for a few months by illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lower" to the rest during his childhood, because "you didn't accept socially that you liked boys and girls."
He said, "Even today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really been what has given me the power and the strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and its image has been used in this year's Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass that "hope" on to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year with the winner of an Oscar, who took him 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much from so young" (I went to my first 14-year-old Olympic Games and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has been through the same heights and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is undoubtedly Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is whether they had the passes to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell him that I couldn't be in the front row," he said.
"He had his hand among mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him in choosing his first song, Heather Small Proud, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played the event every two years to get a record for 12 times, was released by Captain Furyk for the Saturday fourballs and forsoms.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so many times done for the United States, the five-time champion of major tournaments had to be made up to cheer up in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest moment of your career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best way for the Le Golf National field, where long-term rough punishes continuously with mischievous blows.
And if the field is no longer disappointing enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday game, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual matches, started in an impressive way, Mickelson's party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, couldn't say much more.
"She fully understood the role she had today, gave me a slap on her back and, surrounding me with her arm, said she would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine it playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out, and that's how we think it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it's great to have it on the team," he said.
"I think younger players have loved to have it as support, too, this week; it was fun.
It brings much more than just game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you come with a substantial advantage in the last days of Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 party in Valderrama, where a band captained by Seven Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to eliminate the others by weighing the heels for a minimum margin, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we made a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it at Brookline and lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little time," Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that that team isn't finished.
You have to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not more or less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what your players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would not want to advance.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test all your ability as a golfer.
That's the message that we have to pass on to the players, get the best out of one tomorrow.
Now move aside your partner, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, which added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Milage of Medina".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super-important matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did on Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the entire tour," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The German Navy's new frigate should have been charged in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the coming year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the boat that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, as cited in the newspaper Die Zeit a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery bothered the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Fragates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as very small radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have led to the fact that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its overseas power) will already be obsolete when they begin to serve, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate took over last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It has been the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other class ships that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, has also posed a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the €3100 million (3600 million), instead of the initial €2200 million.
The problems awarded to the new frigates are particularly relevant in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, recognized that the Navy is "missing ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old boats were low, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the Daubenton river bats and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special tape recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds that are collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of bats and what species they do.
A report and a map of habitat will then be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests must be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bats populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the topic of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in this field, who are dedicated to carrying out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, sometimes, rescues.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reserve dedicated to bats of Scotland in the state of Three in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Three, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as it can involuntaryly destroy a breeding colony and eventually kill 400 females and females, which would mean annihilate a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people "wanted to meet" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Juventus he is accused of violating an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is charged with having paid $375 000 to cover up the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, took over the story as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as ever.
They want to get famous by just mentioning me, but that's the way I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges that have appeared in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy," Reuters reports.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damages for a amount corresponding to the gravity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of his personal rights in recent years."
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, he allegedly, Ronaldo and Majorga, went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her, according to documents recorded at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga stated that Ronaldo was kneeling after the alleged incident and told him that it was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had let go of that "one percent" left him.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but was consented.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and made photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to arrive at an extra-judicial settlement because she had "terror in reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, as she continues traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he changed to Juve, a large Italian football for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret its entire life" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit," said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" for Toyota UK to inform the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily stop at its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of customs delays on a Brexit without agreement could result in the loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced some 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production parons at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears regarding EU exit without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he will close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns to which automobile manufacturers refer revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted mode of production (just in time) or at the latest), where the pieces come every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture cars by charge.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and the supply of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory on his Derbyshire plant, the company said and, in that case, the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers Plan of Theresa May, where future relations with the EU are established, is "calibrated precisely to avoid such controls in the border crossings."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the step right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsoovallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesman said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan in which our future relations with the EU are delineated."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with General Deputy Physician Rod Rosenstein could "possess himself another week," as the dispute over the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The expectation before Trump decides to fire the deputy general or not and thus compromise the independence of Mueller has fed Washington's cocktails for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his talks with Trump with a microphone he himself took to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (at that time at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "not" fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to postpone to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, but this would mean delaying the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide about the march and I'm going to inform the press, as I do."
Some journalists would reject that statement: Sanders has not conducted any press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what were the reasons.
Sanders said that the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who act with great discretion, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are bragging."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president carries out more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, at the same time quoting without proof: "We have contrasted those numbers."
Press wheels will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the President of the United States directly, I think it is much better than doing them to me.
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in recent weeks, so that this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press wheels with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why it was so, where he made an angry appearance and, on occasion, strangely before the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State of Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU staff working at the Scottish HHS to express the country's gratitude and desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of EU citizens' requests for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which she chose to make the decisions expected this fall have continued.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue relying on you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, player of Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically emergency after a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it to an in-depth examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the kind of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners shall be subject to a higher estate transfer tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected with this measure will be used to cover "without ceiling" according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the income tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to be used for the "without ceiling"
The additional money raised by the increase in the tax on the transmission of estates to foreign buyers of properties in the United Kingdom will be used for aid to "without ceiling", announced today Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters who have higher incomes.
The increase in the tax on the transmission of farms will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also includes the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the most wealthy areas in the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large builders of maintaining very high prices in the properties by buying eagerly unintended land and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "problem housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive reforms for housing, including rental controls and the end of unwarranted evictions.
It also proposes to empower local authorities to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland coach says that his "primary goal" is to become a coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots are excited at the possibility of revitalizing the Northeast Club, which is now the third place in the League One (the third division of leagues of England), at three points from the first.
He passed to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," said Ross on Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it's something that has always made him want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a successful club."
Ross' predecessors as Head of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he moved on to names so established in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, the success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can get back to the club where it should be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, having spent some time as an assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical body.
Then, he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren go from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought that management was the best thing I could do, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I was able to make a very good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel fine.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life in which I felt better, no doubt."

According to one survey, the perfect time for a look is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits in the British pubs fighting for survival, but it concentrated all the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Pub and bar groups saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, as shown in the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA company consultancy, which was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England remains in the World have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in which the pubs increased by 2.8 % their profits, but the restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8 % in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered with heat, although not in a drastic way as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, drinks sales rose to 6,6% during the month, while meals dropped by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM's hotel and leisure analysts said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors with regard to sales in the out-of-home business market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8% in sales compared to last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing pressures at costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell whether the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief you need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurants, bars and pubs sector, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined billing of over £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One in five children have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted at 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on the fake Instagram pages
The news has exacerbated fears of sexual content being published
20% of students said they had a "principal" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in false Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has exacerbated fears of sexual content being published.
Some 20% of the students said they had a healthy "principal" account showing their parents, while others had private ones.
A mother who accidentally found herself on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate me."
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC director, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish athletic federation directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland's track and field and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from their great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the entire world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit by relying on it in its directive," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to bring things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and now is a regular BBC expert, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or to what extent I would do so.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the cockroaches where it is compared to mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A sales company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares to mothers breast-feeding with cows to whom they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent school in the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie published an ad inspired in a video with some ironic music where it is shown to mothers who count the freedom that gives them the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I command myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Sort them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, you have to get pregnant before you give birth to be able to produce milk, except that they take their babies away days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie milk extractor is discreetly adapted into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Truumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Go ahead with a more headstrong ad."
However, other people defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted that the song turned out to be "distinguishing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still had breast-feeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little allocated, but I don't give it any more rounds.
It's a genius product," one woman told us.
Another person told us: "It's a funny announcement directed to mothers who use a breastfeeding bomb (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement does not praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who are milking with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly coupled within the lactation bra, which makes its users move, hold their babies and even get out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that one deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, we intended to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in a entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded through the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of displaced minors discreetly at a camp on the Texas border
The number of juvenile immigrants detained has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx on the border has almost been maintained at the same usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are making it difficult to teach these children.
Traditionally, most of the godfathers, who were also undocumented immigrants at their time, feared that the proposal to host a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking office of the Office of Immigration and Customs, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to teach unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the sponsors or their families are illegally present in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we keep chasing these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute the fastest minors, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers at the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for protection shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers in the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent arrests or attempts to flee.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as the Tornillo facility, where it is more likely that, because of its size, signs of discomfort in these children are overlooked.
In addition, moving to camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the topic "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must retire immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been torn apart from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that adequate conditions were provided for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "segregating irrational fears" that caused refugees to decide to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib's last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault on the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear steps" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (connected to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
The UN Special Envoy, a Mistura Staffan, expects to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a removal or scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would be without doubt "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the rates reached at maximum hearing times have doubled to 1.05 million for the NNC and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded the rates of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we still don't understand," says Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survivor", a dramatic series of the ABC on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip you made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
He asked her.
"Because it makes me laugh," it was the answer Scovell received.
The chaos is always rising in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments emerging from Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families could meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of the "deep-back" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather hunter ("a defiant pride garment," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the scanty descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's in part what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he tells us about the alternating distribution of Trump's show and his daily spins of the plot (either entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was refugee inside the house watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He could not get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when in those days we did all those crazy programs and people told us that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss tells me.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the House of Representatives' most adjusted midterm elections
It is no surprise that the influx of money is reaching the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a district of Congress with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former district 12 of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated for Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a fund-raising account for the campaigns among the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the Congressional District 18 in Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, even though after the fall
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a nice meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners moved to the Trump administration team.
The State Department officials decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, who had already received help of about 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other matters, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence plans to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatic, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction to Trump's justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public register.
It is believed that Mueller is also leading to the possibility that Trump's campaign will work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Trump will see himself accountable to that camera, just when he prepares to present himself again to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic which will have an effect on the duration of the continuum.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to give a coup against Hitler. Only it was necessary for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We missed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans now face several of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Trump sacks Vice-Fascal General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has seen himself at a good time since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording to the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times isn't exactly explained.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans de los Rangers, optimist at the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to be classified in the Group G of the League Europe.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season to the 2 to 2 tie against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We managed to make a good point, as the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party believing that we could get something and get out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved the victory at the end, but, in general, the tie was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year it was definitely hard with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice a general environment that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying a lot and we're having good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season behind and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide study said that they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation," Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company, tells us.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
I work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
It incorporates in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Its long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a high-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or ensure yourself with your own savings, provided you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: stick to the legal battles.
Take care to obtain a health care power to designate a trusted person who supervises your medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes in case they cannot communicate.
It can also prepare a notarial power for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and ensure that his bills are paid if he is incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors should you deal with?" asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
We must have everything planned."
They shoot a man with a carabine several times in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a carabine several times while he walked home after nightfall.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not deadly and the police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, attendance officers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, a zone of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and led the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of deadly casualties on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami affecting the south coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regime in Aceh, causing destruction and panic by recalling the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings resulted in the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of massive earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, aged 29 and citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaskan State Police.
According to that police report, when a well-known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin was ordered to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he was brought before the court, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when he was asked to make his statement, he reported the chain.
Palin faces three minor Class A crimes, which means he could spend up to one year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor crime of Class B, with a single day penalty in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and of possessing a weapon in the state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had said he punched her in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking your child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deadly victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which lies north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out last October an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, overthrowing pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of the intention of requesting a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 charges that included eight murder charges with the help of organized crime, which usually use federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atroz, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," is specified in the Notice of Intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time the South District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York went to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be set up in his hospital room, the police said.
The indictment of 22 charges has been found not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction of guilt with life sentence without the possibility of liberation, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "enforce the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should take care of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham's concentration that the United Kingdom would have "come out" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile his divided ranks has been highlighted even more when a Tories group in favor of the permanence have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the plan of commitment signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks of the Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "caos".
MP Bone said at Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added, "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where he told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and it is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out to the streets and voting us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers hold office when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told concentrates that they should make politicians feel "heat" if they saw that they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favor of the stay walked the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved banners from Tories Against Brexit after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus, for the harmonized border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will "consider all possibilities of presenting himself for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will present himself to re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chair of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Much has been speculated about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes that there is a woman at the top."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims player with a gun
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect was arrested for death shots by Wayde Sims, the basketball player of the LSU, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who sees himself in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head that eventually caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got a shot at Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, an original player of 1.98 meters tall Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches last season, being held in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Since the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position on the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton run in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went hard again later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after an action with the nearly-peaked wheels that made Ferrari's pilot have to give up the free interior badly at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, started from the last row of the grill and stood in the seventh square at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tires to achieve a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes in round 44, but could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen the fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein in a meeting on Saturday for his insistence that he failed to filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the Supreme Court nominee.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention directly Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, repugnant and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't filtered it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and so I did."
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night meeting commented: "I will tell you one thing: that has been a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense with the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the wickedness and repugnance, no matter who they hurt, who they have to hit to gain power and control," the president said Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equaled for the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just defeated the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) with Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance for Beauvillier to double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put the local team looking forward to playing in the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a gorge in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen to give Dundee the leadership for the first time in the party upon the end of the second part and assured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as he approached the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home before Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people has managed to safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunanang General refused to leave his seat at the airport control tower Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. This tower was being affected by a strong swing.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling down.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll can reach several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency states that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people have not been contacted," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
A few waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, who will celebrate a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being delivered to military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we do not know what they will find there
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said the CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely and safely the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be counted.
The airline said she was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers followed Saturday in the hospital and that everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane got very low.
"That's something extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who carried out near a spring improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below water.
Aviation safety network data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents from air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the presentation of its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with that of Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they had only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis erased the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip hop wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop moved away from its origins from political messages and from addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop conscious popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl demands a couple to say goodbye to her after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after they get a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA PERSON," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Maurice twice.
After realizing that his lega was mixed up, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice saying that his former African American baby girl had done a terrible job and that she was waiting for a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for one day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now asking the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the six-month position of internal work for which he had been hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," The Post said on Friday, adding that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that the completion of Maurice's employment was most reasonable, since they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife had sent him something I didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go for someone like that?
That's not a very decent thing," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put herself in the place of someone who had read it for the first time before its publication.
It's very nice to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before being inspired by a toy to write the book for children, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "gridulce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to brag," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son that achieved something important: you are proud of him, even if it is not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was transferred urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me she was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the pumping of his heart were slowly exhausted and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was going out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I could not hear, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperuse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane next to the other passengers, other than the terrible experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew," he said.
"I lay down my head and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy by Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and she committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his life away.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it may have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people you can go to and who you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
You don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything like that," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed her change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs from a thread at the time the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what we were asking for (a limited research in time, limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "getting to a pike" in the middle of a partisan paralyzing.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation carried out?
Their refusal is entirely due to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the choice of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of deserters in North Korea "fall" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seuug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unity, said that last year there were 1,127 deserts, compared to 2,706 of 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this matter.
The vast majority of deserters in the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) heavily protected between the two Koreas.
China considers that the deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which generally agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historical" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelesi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival (Texas).
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she's an hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh gave on Thursday to the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During her initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and attracting while speaking about her family and her years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , grading the accusations against them of "serious and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, the Kavanaugh testimony proved that it could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed its bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements with and the way in which he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won't be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won't even be in the court you're in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible Kavanaugh rulings against the Achievable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would cancel certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to find everything okay," Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It's a justified diatrabe, it's months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
He continued: "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive at some company and told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I followed what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an unspeakable rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the elbow and dragged me on a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential career.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital adventure aboard a boat called Monkey Business, which had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, it occurred to him that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would present herself for the presidency.
"It wasn't a premeditated decision," he said to me in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow Whites and the seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she only gave $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he gave his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by the emotions (gratitude for those who had supported him, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), which attracted himself.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember I was thinking, what are you gonna put on my stone?
Did he cry?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were startling, and although there is still much left to finish the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by placing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect $200 billion (£15 billion) in products, thus charging taxes to half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying tariffs from five to ten percent to US products worth $60 billion.
China is committed to equalizing U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will come to light soon.
Making Washington back would mean yielding to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing plays its letters well, US trade war pressures could help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible to start a drop in the economy in either of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than the spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, associate researcher focused on Asian issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has been more than seven years old.
In a speech earlier by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return to the country of the refugees who had to abandon it because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people who still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe is done with Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now had six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team achieved the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his point of departure into the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the beginning of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2 and 1 in English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became European with more tournament victories of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't know how to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a really tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to get the drink back.
It's an achievement of the entire team and I'm very glad I could have helped," said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now he passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Rahm, who has already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday for 2 and 1 in an individual game.
"I feel an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, as I've grown to see this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we're gonna lose him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will continue.
I really want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's our turn to tilt our head.
They've surpassed us."
