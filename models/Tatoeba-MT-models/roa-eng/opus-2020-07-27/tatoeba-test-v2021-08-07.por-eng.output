White: tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang throwing the tower in a6, after which blacks will only have two options: take the tower in a6 or play their bishop for any other house of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and give mate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn of a7 with identical result.
