Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the exclusion of the minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signature of an agreement with Russia disadvantaged to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is still not final, the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there had been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal for the withdrawal of paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code against the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be defined who the winner is
As is the custom in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it's about diluting whether it's about moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional Sharia law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will cut off their hands.
Women can already be forgotten to get emancipated and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established which we cannot imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only or objectively the best and, probably, did not agree, on the other hand, with the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accept grateful help from unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks did not lead them by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When conquerors are being sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantee of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, locals don't have a problem expelling the "crosses"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get to do with Libyan black gold alone with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West will finally be able to presume to protect human rights.
Whenever the followers of the Sharia don't cross us.
A New Age of the Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are hunting for investors.
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the four-month period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today the bond market has broken records.
Investors are no longer set alone in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's 0.4%
Both countries have made the second quarter data public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), although in France a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-quadre-monthly period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and ČSU has defined the trend of gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development.
The results are even worse than the analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Internationally, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to data previously and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen annually by 5.2 per cent.
His ten-year bond interest is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem also starts to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bonds at 10 years of age remain at 4 per cent, although the situation is worsening in the area.
In Germany, voices are raised saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They beat 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium 200 million.
The football team is fulfilling the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, the victory was won by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defended from the attacks of the local team, so that there will be no shortage of the European championship date.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough reporting.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won for 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who passed two great occasions.
Also, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the eleven Czech will not miss the quote of the European Cup, so the arches of national football will bring you a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
It's been a good offensive game since the first few minutes.
Both teams were only committed to keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks to the other camp in defense, just what the Czech defense could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students went to pray on Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then ran death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahán human shields around the nuclear technology center where they work with uranium.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a recent report noted that Iran, according to all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
There is talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students went to pray at noon at Isfahán's nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be possible, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isphahan plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and dinner filled
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5 per cent.
Obese children come in most families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It shows again the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children are fed at least twice as often as children in families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a chance."
In families of overweight children there is no custom of practicing sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and took part in the same nearly 900 primary education children from all over Czechia.
It was already the second edition of the "Obesity of Not a Chance" program, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
An adequate diet and well-exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obesity children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," she collected one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with dinner wrapper
Experts warn that in healthy development, details are important, too, that they also have, for example, a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Czechia, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has its own breakfast.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing gets lost.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that among families of obese children, fried potatoes are consumed more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet refreshments daily (70%).
In general, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed do sports, but among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age, from the point of view of healthy nutrition, are far from ideal."
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," the final report of the study warns.
As a main meal, the pasta takes the palm and follows closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject vegetable and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence," in many cases a significant change was made in favor of the principles of healthy eating," the results of the study are pointed to.
It calls attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also choose in the questionnaire the poultry meat and the fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals support
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final reviews, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pinhead.
We are once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone's a cricket, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must be able to optically smooth wide shoulders, stretch a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given certain tricks on how to make the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth getting at least one piece of extra fabric sewn to fit.
They will certainly not repent, for the clothing that feels perfectly is priceless.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or flagged.
There are certainly many kinds of diverse information and body information, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to whom he will have to design two changing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect, the style of fashion that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
He touched me to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Crying inside, for me, is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently will have fattened a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them from the magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, and then produce them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The designer therefore did not see only physically, but also dealt, for example, with the product pages in the magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, pockets, shelters, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník spoke to us about all of this.
But it's all over for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same clothes in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in classics with cows and T-shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just fix it and climb the neck to get a totally different picture.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, first you need to know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
I finally find it clear why we memorize all these formulas, which is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not about the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a designer has to have more types of clothes on the reserve he's trying to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all different to those used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style assume they alone, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetine have made her a world star.
In Czechia, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of the designers.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not that important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to keep in mind that it is very likely that they show us a size very different from their real (less).
Then it is only gagling and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/dellegated, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the designer does not just focus on fashion, but that he has to understand of outfits.
During your work, you should mostly communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't care, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify him as a garment and completes him with beautiful clothes, you cannot take and throw away all that was and say, "how ah what a horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them in," says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, quitapels, or imperdibles. There is also nylon thread (which serves the designer during the photo session of products such as handbags or caps), special clothes hook clamps in front, if it was larger (alphires and other types of hooks are not allowed, because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the soil could be damaged and much more the outside could be damaged.
And we did nothing more than dress and dress.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me joy in praising my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all those we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle unoccupied, is complicated because of a number of improper neglects of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent, the expectations were met, but this was of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to do.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, has aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
I promised that I would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, it appears like a game that shouldn't end up being once again a kind of action without more.
We are also curious to know how the embedded scenes would be, where the main character comes down from the car and walks through his own foot.
As usually happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much as to what we expected.
There are races that can be taken as acceptable, but in the total count are lost points because of absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
Actually, no mistakes can be called, but it is more about the incomprehensible gap of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely feel that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant at the sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very nice visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, try to advance a number of required rivals (the normal one in a classic race), then try to win time (timed classic duel) and then wait a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all of this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game than could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The model of driving follows the traces of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a career conceived with a lot of action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better between the games of competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, this is no longer the same as the collisions.
Of games like this cannot be expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it's completely destroyed.
Thanks to the rest system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The refreshments are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, there are only five receptacles available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's nothing but help in case something goes wrong, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, neither the re-reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you find yourself in some place "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you have arrived five minutes before or after.
This angers especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent moves forward without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or either slow down.
It's the same when you arrive, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the match you will reach places where, without considering the moment, the same opponent will always lead you to the same place.
Furthermore, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes before you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car papilla.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it's a pity, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens and where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't upset boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You need to be attentive to the gas station next to the road, because right there you have to change the car, although in the vast majority of cases it will suffice what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and super-deportive exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know for the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both the challenges and the stories.
By reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting from the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is connected an Autolog function online, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you get to run dark through the tracks (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the subway convoy and takes you forward without further.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity it is, at the most tense times, to reduce the quality of the image and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of the image continues is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please the majority of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is secure, but prepare because mistakes will hit you in your eyes with the force of some airport reflectors.
The choirs of the Carolina University will participate in the concert "Terciopel Students".
The joint celebration of the International Student Day and the anniversary of the Terciopelo Revolution as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festival Academic Festival.
During the same period, twenty corals will be presented from secondary and university centers.
The festival revolves around two concerts on 17 November.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negatists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a barracks to be waged."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation settles a little, calm and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vinová, began with conviction at the Faculty of Law.
How can we not take seriously his "clear and openly about Europe" motto, which he already said at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also laid down the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first arises criticisms, which if it is insulsive, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I must say that he left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them, and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us Olomouc cheese
Vice-Nová has also taken up the agenda, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czechia.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments for the time being.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good break", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being addressed.
On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, must be approved, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and what less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms or jerseys that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive rather the negative aspects than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the limited support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and I am approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman at my side tells me, "What, you've already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it turns out he doesn't do any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting new tough budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real from the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to and those who do not, stay away."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen the Europe of both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czechia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU must be debated among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the nearest one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as present and, however, has been 100 years since its foundation.
The basis for this long-term approach was put by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many of the world's problems have solutions if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal journal that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even further in our second century," said the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano during his anniversary.
A fancy system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Ba the Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first U.S. operators who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps it IBM in the relationship with the customer.
Already from the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (as one of the first global companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, so Palmisano will replace it next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working for 30 years at IBM, where she's been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, of which there is infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that ideas emerge, since nearly half a million people work in the firm.
An Institution With Good Reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise," says the economist professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering into the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the United States familiarly because of its logo, it has become in the last 100 years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (development of both equipment and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents in all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the automatic cashier, payment cards, financial switches, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technological firm for market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just met the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not post for its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
So IBM has no problem building their bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, leave them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first head, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far IBM has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown strategically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
The currency of IBM is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM history: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions like the famous "check clock", which allows to control the entry and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over his supervisory council until 1930.
Flint appointed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are sustained).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat cutters and cheese to registering boxes.
During the first four years Watson ran the company, the billing doubled to $9 million and began the large expansion of the company across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost 40 years after occupying the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide space flights (in Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous Moon flight).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classics "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came to the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and services of high value added.
The strategy that has been paid IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example in the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia from then on, the first country he had in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic centre for outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. Here too, there is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and have established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové in her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after , and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even fired from him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife lies with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with her arms open.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our home, no one will throw him away."
"But here I would live not as my dear and old borrico who was wrong, but as a man to whom I join certain ties," Rychtářová said and added that he had already disengaged from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph so far does not care that his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set this up as a marriage on the role and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases."
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, where she goes or even if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, each of them will usually name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where are some female vices that are able to boil the blood to the men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your orange average that is dependent on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trip in the week?
Do you like to buy often on scraps?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for purchases, at least a little.
But let's see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk all the way through the clothing stores, look for tight clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women going shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you'd better wait in front of the door.
Unsatisfying Constant
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to relax at least five kilos -- should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
He's like an infinite Jew.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the bathtub and all for at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for treading the clean floor with a dirty foot, for her children who have soiled a freshly cleaned toilet and a shelf with glass doors that cost her so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleaning surely should not be a primary concern in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make disagreeable comments
"The used panties are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to put those used socks on tomorrow as well."
"The wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If he makes those comets his couple more times a day, he knows he'll get it out of his cages.
Of course. You don’t mean anything wrong, just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slanders and sparks
Some women also go slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
At best each of us is sometimes escaped by a small and harmless chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are noisy women who are not in control, who love to whisper and often do so, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female workforce.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
Jágr's hockey front participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assistances that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 to Carolina's court and put Czech players back in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared the party's best player.
Two attendances were awarded to the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vraček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I had already told him before the party that I would make triple."
"I introduced him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance he gave Giroux a goal, following the first rake of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the album behind the Hurricanes gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored goal.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After working with Jágr he placed the third goal, after his shot ran away from Wayne Simmonds' room store.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the court, but he's definitely among the three best," Jágr told his center.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my peers played for me, and that now produces results," Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, to a long-distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"I took off the record, I took speed, and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to get on the record and I'm glad I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the party as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also a two goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but it's just that nothing can be done against it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much turning players turned against us, we couldn't resist him."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the disc out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," said one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory on the Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold travel only to the socialist bloc in most cases, as travels to the West were very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime bowed to the west and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend all night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Yet not all was won.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable person", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way in which the Czechs travel has suffered since 1989 has been a genuine revolution.
While until 1989 it was not for us to spend vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989, could not be travelled freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to the neighbouring States of Western Europe, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see any tarts from the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czech groups in the parks were sleeping in tents, as our income back then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take the food with it (conservatives, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living increased, and with it also average wages, which led to an increase in travel demand around 1997.
With the increased demand for travel the agencies began, starting in 1997 regularly, to prepare the trips using charter flights connections, which led to an incredible decrease in travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs were travelling visaless to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have been leaving each year, making distant and hot countries. This winter will now fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit them about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, so our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses on the accommodation site.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly this Thursday will take place in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, it will not even be possible to vote for the three candidates.
The Czech football presidents are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June not without having to call on his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knows how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smichov, because the talks had been blocked and not just about the method of choice.
No consensus was reached, as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the Statutes, in the third round the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he or she will apply will win.
The Moravia Region is prepared to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system", as Svoboda understands the objections of the dying party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, it also agrees with Tomaš Paclík, although it is supposed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like to have the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen, owner, who applied for the first time as a candidate and directed his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be relaxed with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will be the protagonist again, and so it will be more cooperative," said the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in managing football, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope you reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not about the conflict between bohemians and residents, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time left for all sides to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the ranking party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be held at the ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the parties divided into the most powerful sports organization in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new address to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
The pact will strive to reach the presidency, because it does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfied all his ideas on the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be nominated for such a relevant post.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not present me as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day you have not been able to find such a person," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I might consider."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he says.
What is supposed to be most troubling to Paclík at this time is Pelta's relationship with the President of Pilsen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status will be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with caution his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning Thursday's elections, Paclík could come up with cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion, the other candidate, Rajchl, has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as the manager of an association."
"I don't even put my noses there where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September raised a lot of attention to supporting the suspension of the Committee of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities of private companies, as since last summer it has also been the Pilsen Director, who, with his support, celebrated the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to spend more money on the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be devoted."
"If gambling taxes were to be increased, as political parties say, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where this money is going to stop," he says.
Additionally, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "no supporter".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in the fact that I give in hypocritically my actions from the Pilsen Club to another person and then come back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the post-election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of its election, it would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve disputes regarding the electoral rules in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting on Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in the event of being elected, on representation and raising funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement might be good for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels are already taking care of football a long time ago and expect to meet this Thursday to the new President."
"They feel the time has come for someone to manage the association," the man thinks who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, you believe you have enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria prevailing in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a pledge to win delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer if this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, he tries not to get involved with his opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respected his legal training, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík, who, unlike Pelta, did not leave the puppet with his head.
"It's been over a year in the football world, and it's already made some successes."
"His attacks but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That is why many of them doubt his true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who continues to be faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions to higher ones.
The latter should be a football promotion shopper.
"Asimism, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would immediately become involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," ČTK told the 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as chair of football would not result in any personal changes in the staff.
"You should first know each employee's duties," Strahov said, where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
In spite of the current catastrophic scenarios facing the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," another two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would begin to work passionately.
If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected to the Fourth General Assembly as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would certainly be reluctant.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of high-performance young football players."
"With this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I'll assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of impulse."
"To many people this will probably not like it, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not re-enacting as a candidate.
"They all know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have said to me that I must not give up, because then others too would be defeated."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, without more," he said.
He is also encouraged to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work is over that I don't want you to lose now."
"There are processes that have started and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the Hašek era.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I may be reproached for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only so will everyone feel well and not only the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind doing the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and other town, whose winners would go to the first division."
"The current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams would not be given, which represents a problem for young Moravia players," Rajchl said.
Although the Presidential elections were in the hands of Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl did not stop believing in his ability to be elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, whose successes include the saving of tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, the negotiations on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "unqualified to regain trust in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the staff in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for my sake," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from incredible optics, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Anyone visiting Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being in the water is.
When Iris Meder made an investigation trip last year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in his luggage, a bathrobe.
Fallen back onto the water, he looked at the art dome on the high, swam towards the marble angelotes, who waited for it on the edge of the pool and was amazed at the modernist indoor swimming pool meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectic historian Meder explored over 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathrooms palaces in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and the Czech Republic, respectively, in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, he says, only water is different.
It only bothers you that the bathroom enthusiasts have to make up with blue tiles and chlorine-heating, while the running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of the forest of fir trees or listen to the happy trins of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools must always be so ugly," said this Viennan resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The boating in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all senses are cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the floor, the bathrooms have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything folds up optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-sized photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly it is willing to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding examples in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, you will find the waters with nitrates in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline waters and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: As the whole city puts its eyes on the Zurich indoor pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps more extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs climb steam in winter, while deep the Ötztal mountains rise up in the sky.
Alhambra on the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békscsaba, Hungary, gas oil fever is so strong that people think they have come to a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo is glued to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful bathing places, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked plot.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demolished windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the curse grow among the tiles.
The decadence contrasted in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can you discover neo-Roman elements of its construction times in 1844, but also an Arabic hall of the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its emerald modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank renounce its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, to 84 percent of Germans it does not seem acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents claimed that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensified the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a consumer organization Foodwatch survey.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock bets raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer defender's campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have declined bids and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deems to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "Early food-priced bets are especially drastic in how wild banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank manager, especially in terms of obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money into stakes for food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of people who go hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the Board of Directors will change something different from what was not planned on the Board of Directors.
By abandoning the controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to hardly care about any losses, that's what his successor will do.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1.001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were set.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from being known, 49 percent would request, after reflecting, cancel his account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The pavilion transferred
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high elevations and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now it's reopening as a showhouse.
Modern post-gerra architecture loves, clear forms, crystal halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels universal exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is considered to date a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became known internationally.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition construction, rose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and in the opening of a museum of the 20th century called "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the proper spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
At present, architect Adolf Kristanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic skater about ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation should be exhibited, there should be a coffee shop and a bookshop and also a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Kristanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only did he significantly reform the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he enlarged and was awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "great and huge place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew about the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devourer," said Kristanitz.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, a glass fiber reinforced insulating crystal was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel coming down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly what it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find materials that were good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of a rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "that Brussels wine" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the proper consciousness."
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened an urban luck hit. The totally new and planned " central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another lucky blow happens: House 21 could be strengthened by another construction of Kristanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city over a nearby place at Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent the wreckage of the trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What's costing millions.
In the fight against wreckage and delays of the winter trains, Deutsche Bahn spent more than EUR 70 million this year, according to a journalistic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the investments planned until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
In order to achieve a better availability of vehicles and the railway network even at an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and the Andeans.
The goal is to clean snow and ice and 90 per cent of the needles necessary for the operation at the end of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Deutsche Bahn’s president, Rüdiger Grube, warned of train failures and delays also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travellers, since, among other things, he lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train had broken down an axis in the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR106 million) in an agreement, to end the content due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA financial market regulator recribs to many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimised risks.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to come to the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA, welcomed the departure of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy in order to protect customer investments.
NCUA is attempting to reintegrate the losses of millions originating.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also called for accounts for other large banks and in summer proceedings against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
They are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the high point of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have engaged in countless processes to receive compensation or to punish errors.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of claims.
It reproduces to the 18 large international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a FHFA demand, which is a business amounting to $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute respond to "substantial losses", without specifying an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared no investment in computer companies or Information Technology since long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's trade report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
It should have understood long before IBM offers above all services and seeks computer systems for the information technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed at the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has ascended to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement until now.
He commended the leadership that dealt with the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of calculation centres.
The older computer pioneer over 100 years of age also offers software and advice as well as powerful business teams.
Buffett has avoided technology companies so far.
He said he was just investing in companies he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, enlarged it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has provided him with the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock in stock came up one percent.
"The blue giant", as IBM is known, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that relives itself.
The killings of eight small, trick and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a phantom believed to have died a long time ago, since the fire-like attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned whether xenophobia exists in Germany.
The ultra-rightst network revealed a magnitude whose dimensions were not much less predictable.
"Will the bloody ideology be revived again?", titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right workshop.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil before the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The cohabitation was set in scene with happy colors, like a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media like a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" does not insist that this mental connection be drawn.
"It starts to smell bad," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
He stressed that the assassins were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the German internet forums of Turkish origin, police behaviour and their subsequent success in search are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long sought out suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on, immigrants are lost only self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the penalty to the whole network.", writes "Selen".
This means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravate the group feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press then mainly criticized the weakness of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the shooting in the form of a fire in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Germans are doing with the taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media is once again showing how deep it has been, since then, the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of a broad explanation and an overestimation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for frank words.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into the financial crisis and since then it has slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, it was known in July that in 2013 it would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the administrative council of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly glad, commends Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired strength and leaves to fall kind comments about its future companions.
"The USB has achieved revitalization."
"I am pleased to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and failed €1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, managing director of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the administrative board of the USB has since been considered equally touched, and they all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will be in charge of the chair of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counselor and has had a surely necessary adaptation period.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just re-tested that he deserves the title "the biggest bank in the scandal of Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the largest global asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slid from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset administrator, but also handy, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later bank teacher in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always rated USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders, how could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something went very badly on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, who had until then been considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was embroiled in high-risk securities losses and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some would look with contempt until just before: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 at the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its misinvestment, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought trouble values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a bond that was compulsoryly convertible, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was affirmed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of the wealthy customers, who had possibly failed taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves $780 billion, a refund of unjustifiable benefits for these businesses with payment compensation.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to helping tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition by rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through misconceptions and in the administration of goods by aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS would get it back, this tragic story of the operator happens, an individual operator failed 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, evidently, this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economy and finance at the Zurich University's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the risk controls."
So the idea of precaution arose, with which Swiss bankers had been presenting themselves for a long time, to be guardians of the world's greatest assets: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the Swiss private bank, it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat at the Bahnhofstraße Street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are boisterous, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewelry such as Tiffany's between traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through Credit Suisse's palace, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy swivel door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a great sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some time moved the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, opinal, mainly at the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have been accustomed for a long time to the customs of Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, handed over its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS Crash" in Spanish).
Politicians awarded up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How's it going with you?
You talk to Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, due to the merger, was too large for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of property administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely way with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bicycle run.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says Banque expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The deactivation arrived before the case.
The UBS employees clearly agree with the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
He had a few steps.
In foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares, it was at the highest level.
However, the business consultants in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed inme", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and sell them then, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks looked for the descent for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
Positions at the UBS have become projectable seats and are currently unsafe.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decline a lot, it is clear at the moment.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only 51-year-old Italian-Suizo was thought to be a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently direct the business of the UBS, communicated the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank back to its state in the mid-1990s.
It removes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is currently sure to ask.
So far he only says that he will first find a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the U.S. stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has made American investors afraid at the beginning of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remain ineffective.

General relief on government changes in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back to a close, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial assets are listed on the sales list.

What created scepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from recession, and there are further signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, only confirmed this precaution, is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with the CNBC.
That is why from their point of view it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws away a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. technology sector.

Smart grass spreads in cities
In many places grasses are considered "problem birds": they do not expel these very intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, fats have belonged to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of neighbors are accumulated by the dirt and the noise of the animals.
Although no medium has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Fats no longer leave cities, experts say at the first Graehouse Symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from across the country discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grassland; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
Fats are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for mass killing of district grasses was launched by negative press headlines.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by trappings for birds and killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"Expulsing and eliminating them normally does not accomplish anything," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper at Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or pulling the trees is usually unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies of divide and distribute elsewhere."
Running them alone is imaginable as an exception in hospitals, old residences or colleges.
"We have to live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination is possible to run animals from sensitive residential areas and baits to re-enter other places.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with aplomo."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the ashes of Ascheberger, where signposts report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion about the noise criticism of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, fats not only take advantage of the resources to access small pieces, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etologists at Cambridge University checked in four steps to where the intelligence of birds comes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must have dropped a stone on a platform to reach a poll larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning grates had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a polyline larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the tube shooter.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the 2012 Eurocopa.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.

Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54).

At the Stadium da Luz de Lisboa, Portugal started in a perfect way.
Ronaldo ran a live book from more than 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her strengths to score from afar and achieved 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the runner Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, English leader Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the carrier line (33).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Then Wolfgang Stark College of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the Helder Postiga attack in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card by throwing himself on the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark painted a controversial criminal record after an action by Fabio Contrano, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended with the last doubt in the minute 81. with the goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Bundesliga Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the porter Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in his own door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the front turn, very right at the Czech gate.
After the rest the Czechs had to protect the width of the world-famous porter, the front of the FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end felt the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not move from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat on the world’s third-party bank in 2002, Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the 7th minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was not able to send the ball inside the door.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him have any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the minute 62. took place Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa

Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with 4-0 in the pre-arranged party, headed in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied to the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had its first great opportunity.
From the very first moment, the defense has been avoiding possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense by the porter Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, getting the 1-0.

Massacre at a personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Grief of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatic person of the kind that can make one fall his soul at his feet.
Here are some tips for action: Gently boot this page and convert it to your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novel narrative, and this dramatic persona will function as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is a rare book, which accurately describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feels, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines experiences in times of war by about 20 ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, from Collegiants and botanists to escalators, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad or die.
Their lives blink here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones add to the mixture while others turn off.
Mr Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the deadly trenches war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intrepid problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war overwhelms the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of rope.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or running away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"Charity of fact," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Its stories have been obtained in most of its memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and fixing them with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Sucedaneos, everywhere succeed."
"Coffee substitute, false aluminum, imitation gum, paper sales, wooden buttons."
It continues to talk about the food that happened in Germany.
Describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed in beef fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and furskins of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There is, it notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own impulse towards savagery and expresses his attitude about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that that coat means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that slammed, slammed fence."
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
"Once you give up thinking of sacrificing yourself, you'd like to think it might happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "a convicted person being strangled in secret."
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the petriary of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced with clothes of good making that executes his butcher's while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to avoid service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococic pus, which soldiers buy and embalm with it their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often gives way to a life-blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war has "desired exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No News on the front of Erich María Remache, rather than full stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, ripped that page of dramatic persona out of your fingers, and burned it with a beer.
After a false step in advance, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturbing helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation remained secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, and his presence emphasized how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spray spray spraying on the demonstrators, violating the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
That is why the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters revealed itself after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves by seeing how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters appeared before time after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces throughout the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there was the least number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers gathered on the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
Pre-recorded lights and messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community business agents went to the park with their clear blue shorts, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesperson for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from getting into action at the park, and that they had been brutally treated by the agents.
Mr Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense chain of personal effects of demonstrators, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic packed with clothing, the Department of Cleansing team followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police went in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp sat between them through their arms.
And two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the candles.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The discharge operation was completed about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were by "change of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer in the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was there, "he wasn't running operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
There were barricades on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking off the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of backsliding came flying out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools attending poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its efforts to revoke the dismissals.
Seventy-seventy-two assistants from school, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders described as political revenge for their refusal to allow the city's access to a health care fund by working groups last spring to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities categorically denied that charge.
At a hearing at the City Council last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
A Council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be dismissed.
Municipal District officials 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the complaint, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black and Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the Legal Department of the City, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of layoffs in urban poor schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been insufficiently subsidized in a chronic manner.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools at the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs at District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired at Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which it calculates additional funding for each school student per poor student.
The union also states that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a school's payroll master to a scholarship, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators were dismissed," says the draft complaint, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and murdered, and for the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, when they start rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a claim of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress quite upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
Then, the Congress's indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee " congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "lauds the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the committee's main Republican.
The Lugar spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually results in a vote of the whole assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfil, while the representative José E. Serrano (Democrat by New York) wants to remove the two-mandate limit for presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to permit the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that the members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace was unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Fucked but not defeated," Giffords talks in his first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway melody "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
On his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard."
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special "20/20" one hour-long program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new couple's book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analyzed the Giffords recovery since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while the therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A flattery of lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "finished", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: You see the congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who has been on therapy for two hours every day, said he does not remember the day of shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article from the March 12 murder newspaper when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being arrested in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Duro, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, "Gabby, you haven't been defeated," said Kelly.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna get back and you're gonna come back harder than ever."
Troops make it feel worse than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marine children stormed into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them like an orphan," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was too bad.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over from the military and a distant American audience, sometimes a worshiper.
The troops are blessed with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public acts more and more as if they punish him with those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear unpleasant or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations on the pity are carried out in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be "an angry and violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding work in Washington immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," said Cancian, telling his children.
Military concerns arise, in part, from the indifference of the United States to the wars.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country with little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of claimants are organizing for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who wore a 12-watt beer package.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the Texas native left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd heard my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit against the former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in reducing widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or giving proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going to get the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of which could be part of future demands.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be prosecuted by current or ancient soldiers for the injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active staff.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely clear the front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time for the army to upgrade too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a suit against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of " personality change" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them the discharge of the service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
Its group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims of benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine bills have been introduced separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which account for approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, about 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were at trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he denounced the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a multitude of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared himself a witness in the name of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work -- I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed him with personality disorder, which made him unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was exempted from the service under less- than-honoured terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his lawsuits continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of Doctrine Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that it poses responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the audience isn't on its way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform occurs," he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack against his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't so hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
The personal information ally on Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then sent them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right matches in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a totally new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a sort of spin, "those who combine their activism in line with out-of-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like" messages on the walls and state updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the name of the site in the title up to nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to survey people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, from Wisconsin University and his colleagues, found that university students who talked about their drunken feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counsellors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with his drunkards.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child at the Seattle Institute of Child Research, Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "catching" its own population to obtain data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of election participation in the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago who claim that the site should make available to others its large amount of research data).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with the public student's Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information about a user's profile and the messages on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a tech researcher, Selwyn believes that a pen and pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Frio e Inhumano: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Temple Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I stand in opposition to the court, as it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognise the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Brevik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but to me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be informed that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview, Shown at a Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered to which it has been depopulated as the advance of a series of special projections in the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a young man of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the beginnings of his personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time they had spent only 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and already worked intensely on their new NeXT computer company, awaiting popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Crickey's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the manager's garage.
This archive material, slightly reedited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The lost 68-minute interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly suppressing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes out to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Crengely's questions, pushing him to go faster to the themes or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see to be doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and it did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"During the years in the business, I'd always ask, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it is done."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings to detail its efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disappointed by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here by describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and you screamed through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone next door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would ever have been an Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into jail just before the same Pope was awake to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and phone sales with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, after hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and called him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I'd make a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, he asked a customer if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while he was in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I got bored and went away and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and it was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led the renaissance of Apple, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"You say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running companies and people in charge of the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is rotten because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire IT industry.
It could have been his size ten times, it could have been the '90s Microsoft...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as artistic expression:
"There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at the same time...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it goes down to trying to expose you to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held in a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study thoroughly the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a demand by 26 States challenging the total health care reform approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the application and, in fact, a historical allegation of 5 and a half hours by March is expected, and the outcome will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General during the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm of lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon Code 4C, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, even if the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges who abide by the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were held in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have outstanding cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that they claim to mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
Emirates airline calls for 50 Boeing 777 double-pass aircraft with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a big transaction when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes rises to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future aircraft orders.
In a study on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order of history for commercial planes for their value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double corridor jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total selling price to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced in the Dubai Aviation Hall 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, who assumes a fuel saving and spectacular passenger services.
The sales price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the greatest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is making money by increasing the price of oil.
That's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps to keep the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air fair occurred four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more impulse after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares went up 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón states that drug traffickers helped his PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governor's count.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy for Governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the Sunday poll.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... took hold of the polls, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting up of a return, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have passed little margin to Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in charge of governor, remained third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A mayor of the PAN was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidatures for fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in front of next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BASD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, the costs of indebtedness of Italy have been dropped dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and have generated calls for major emerging economies to unite to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do its utmost" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility for helping rich Europeans when facing their own and profound economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the one billion million people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed enterprises, and generate losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens with "important chain effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with "low risk" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "continence plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's serious warnings about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts that are coming together could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghan battlefields, to civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already drawing the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional 600 billion or more reduction in cuts that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "rescue", would result in 23 percent overall reductions and a high to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects cannot be executed - you cannot buy three quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other efforts of modernization," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to leave many of our civil servants involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break the faith with those who keep our army and seriously damage the good disposition."
The cuts over time would reach combat troops, said Panetta.
"While the financing for wartime in the overseas contingency accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the contract that supports the war."
"Noma staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuttings on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which one can live, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of US national security, and it must not be allowed to happen."
If the Panetta letter and the recent warnings of senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify the calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts it is about to see.
Panetta has been more and more frank about the possible cuts, although she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential opponents."
"In fact, he invites the aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "cause significant operational risks: delays in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Detaining the development and additional F35 tests could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improving and addressing potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lying in daily life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging charges of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of the Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "pelled" with an open microphone stating to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
Congressman in New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his defiantly defeated quickly by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with offences in funding the campaign related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who would live it will ever forget the media circus unravelled by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are very extensive.
There have been cases in which teachers have given students the responses to the exams in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been overturned.
The liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, bluff, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the declaration, microfacet expressions, question formation and times.
I spent several years investigating scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
The good liars have the ability to read well for others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies", while women say more "orientated lies to others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their couples than those who are not married (but the lies they often say tend to be "enorms").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Notice the posture of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone usually hits with his foot all the time not to make unfair accusations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavioural groups.
Consider these behavioural groups as warning signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their history, can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly, or expose a "post-interview sketch" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have ended.
Interviewers often falsely point out that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his leg to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I haven't had sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... until I understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the unions, as it calmed the environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to take it back.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's director, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will be approved over time, but it is true that with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supply are studied.
"This is a real way of progress," said Representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State may separate any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed their full support.
The pipeline, from 1,700 kilometers, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suppressing legislation to force a remoteness from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle allegedly accused of causing a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the diva of the music record, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, landing his little daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade"'s 18-month-old singer, who suffered " personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when Tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes, and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman that she was angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He became angry and began to use bad words - word C and word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve went hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle leaned over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her environment and retreated to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but there was no reply.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family attorney Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a kindergarten teacher who takes an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate Adversity Slowed the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-named of change, which generated great expectations about the economic progress, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of damage to the ice creams, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was caused in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sinister crops were vegetables, corn and garb.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed accelerated growth, as, from January to March 55,053 signalers were unemployed, with a 4.53 per cent rate of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate increased to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of people dropped to more than 74,000 unemployed signalers, an increase in the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation passed at the congress to combat money laundering, already for people who seize dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the signal labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state is not working as a worker in any social security institution.
Added to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour revenues is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, far below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Direct Foreign Investment over the last 10 years has been recorded, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs from January to June of State FDI amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87,74 per cent compared to the $5 million,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos per year, mainly from tertiary sector enterprises.
Debt
In light of the economic contraction scenario, the State Government requested in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, the same as investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of revitalizing the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a sum of 2 billion pesos, and until November they had not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good already synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year ice-cream stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including ices, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that has not returned fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to refer the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefine, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better shape the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been working to achieve good results in different areas of economic development, there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has made progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marijuana
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of marijuana possession for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the village El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomendist circulated in a truck type pick up, white, where he wore a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to remain in the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Must contribute for works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have so far been advanced, they are at risk of failure by the Government of the State to fulfil its contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that up to now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of the works is made in force.
"It's almost 12 million that's about to contribute to them, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when they've had to give us a share since July," he said, "we've got to start the works and go very far, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million who did not provide the state administration on that occasion.
"We had already been in the previous year because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what was left of the State," he said.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to meet the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to step up efforts to ensure that their respective percentages reached them as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that's about to bring them, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't even given us a fifth."
Valid "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that precedes the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the project they voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The full of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand brought by the House of Deputies, without entering the project discussion, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President-in-Office said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the preparation of the public administration.
"I also do not think that if it were to be done, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would be the federal executive, who has constitutional mandate, the state rectory.
Replacement of analog digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and it translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to delay the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "for covering economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, according to the principle of economic rectory of the State, to include a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and had done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way violates the area of competence of Congress, since compliance with the laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative field, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a vote-by-vote count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PPR, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data presented by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (EMI), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacan did not approve its Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the completion of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the State's Official Journal Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the State's representative to constitutional reforms as invalid and illegal, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal stated that through the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be assumed that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and calculation in the case file or does not work with the President of the Chamber; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the election concerned and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition who applied to the second of the candidates indicated.
The total counting of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary calculation, the difference between the alleged winner and the second successful candidate is equal or lower to a percentage point, provided that the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate remained second, in which case the electoral packages which have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation the choice of Morelia is found, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Felipe Bacio Cortés was very young from the city of Saltillo to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.
Give him the last goodbye.
With honours, the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was dismissed in honor of Governor Jorge Torres López, who handed over to him people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of Saltillo Technology, where he studied in 1985 and stood out in both the study and the sport.

Locate three abandoned corpses on Cadreyta NL's estate
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shots killed in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, in an abandoned estate of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding took place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A presidential communiqué announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will assume office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the beaten trust in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The possibilities for Monti's success were considerably driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced the resignation on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the government of the most technocratic majority that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what would likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks came under pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started on Monday his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the forthcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections go ahead.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that he should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process that is forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The dew of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 calls came to the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranquin, account for a comprehensive record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain an intense activity each year in league and home cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Fury is added to the above in complicated eliminations of Eurocopa and the World Cup football.
Ticco footballers, on the contrary, possess a limited international rock in an area, such as Concaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, brain steering wheel from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other hundred years of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's rye, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tick side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come close at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
The historical golador of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on its two-decade tour of history
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years waiting, but the band ensures that for them it will also turn the dream of playing in the country into reality.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil last week.
The grouping is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete transcription is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, is it a dream realized that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica just once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I wonder because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live in intensity the previous days.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've had during the last 21 years have occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that this set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partially because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we've been keeping from touching, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years' journey.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for over 20 years now that it looks like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the grunt's rise?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it's a little unusual.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time in a city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends of all of them still and honor us to be part of that sound of Seattle that came up.
It is also very odd that a band like yours will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Camron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be alive and secondly, we all worry about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure that you don't stay on tour because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without being encapsulated for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and soccer and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The Las Robertas national band will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose it for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and have to be very entertaining.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics always change live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are their influences?
They're so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunt relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might look more light, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they may sound a little bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt they represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who has served a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of force of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It has been operated four times from cancer to the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added, such as severe erosion, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension, and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilater who operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in all the political affairs between the two nations", according to the South American Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France arising when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world since November, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the establishment of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ' gray list', made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotute fountainer passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at shops around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the characteristics of Nintendo 3DS laptop console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesperson has maintained that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook up the less skilled users.
Once it has been exceeded, the most experienced will be able to take a "second turn" at the playing levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, which did not take place since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes a guide to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting of that the moustache fountain will have to travel dangerous mined platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom swallows the extradition from Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he has made the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy for the washing of US$70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the northern country's request that Portillo be tried there.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account the fact that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he did not put his hands" into judicial decisions and gave him all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The fact of Colom is an executive process after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandate from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has settled its legal position in Guatemala and their human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout the fourth century.
This adds to the 100-long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance in an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradation or falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of heads of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the ex-con of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomà.
The great Hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by the current councillor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also so, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president set Trinijove as an example of knowing how to fight the bad circumstances and by giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Deflocate an okupada farm where macrofests were made
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday at noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51st of Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday's noon the building they were occupying illegally, where they organized macro-fests that were desperate to the neighborhood, in judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeated.
"From now on, there will be access control," said the administrator.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowd parties, which lasted for up to two days and despaired the lodgers.
Next to the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders of the farm made him unfair competition, as they sold the drinks to three euros, while at the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had had to respond to neighbouring noise complaints, while, according to the note, the inconveniences did not cause them by the customers of the nightclub, but the residents of the okupada house and, above all, the party attendants that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The disco manager explained that the trouble was so great that he even reached an agreement with the property owner and nine months ago he "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it has received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group at the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "at once to remove the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but over the last few months the okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and on almost every floor, and that in some even the thefts have occurred.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be forceful against the incivisism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos removed a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four persons had access to the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
The mountain park?
Architects coincide on the occasion of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Around the 80s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some pasquinas of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona metro.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again stood, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park is reflected in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the Jabalis in the role of Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Or that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organisational aspect and for what it is supposed to reflect on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring subject to which to hand when two members of this former caste of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between the views of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modól and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coast front "it becomes necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can start from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect sentenceds for whom the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal for "intellectual networks" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience experienced in the 80s and that it had in the forum area "his singing of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on which to build.
"Limitating something is to fix already the next step," that is, its overstep.
"There is a need to think about new urban planning instruments, because current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters."
More closely with the question, Modól believes that, simplifying, the side of the valley of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by a purely topographic issue.
Modól recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "should not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to its group to intervene in this project "from the first moment."
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is the one that must lead multidisciplinary teams ("all a hit", he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because at the basis of the contest there is a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-competitions -dice - have been called in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This leads, at least if any, to the choice of taking part in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his view, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately higher than the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, a zone of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal owner of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process followed by alleged blackmails
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal owner of the Casino Red has granted him forgiveness before the District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail process against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the city council would allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened a criminal proceedings against the mayor's brother, and on 2 September he was arrested and grounded for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
There he remained for 49 days after being given a second root order after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had dropped the crimes of organized crime and cohesive crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal allegedly for blackmailing the Red Casino owners with one and a half million pesos; however, only a few hours remained in the middle security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was arrested by the Secretary of District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the 1.5 million pesos collection to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for the operation.
This Monday, the legal owner of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; so within the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Judge Ramiro Arias questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the gambling partners was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim may be made regarding the proceedings that followed him; in addition to the fact that no compensation or punishment will be required.
Following the hearing of the legal owner of the gambling house, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
He shall also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results dropped on the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven others, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the ashtrays had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have results before possible; however, research can last several months, even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened in a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical norms, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The ICM reports placed adequate conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft moves towards the boundary area between the DF and the State of Mexico with low-level cloud layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the cloud conditions the crew has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and side path.
The aircraft's debris pattern suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the sinister, there is still no evidence on the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that he could have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was allegedly disarticulated along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented in structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit of the Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population to participate whether or not it is eligible, to attend IMSS sports units in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday starting at 8:00 hours.
He stressed that the protocol began at the Quauhtémoc Sports Unit (Posient Mexico State) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Mexico East State).
Once the objective of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is achieved, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
At the 14 November World Diabetes Day, the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of specific dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and inherited history of disease, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He explained that Saturdays apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the genes associated with childhood obesity are identified).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys noted that, in just six years, there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed,' the IMSS expert pointed out.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics results in the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, allowing them to detect any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (canthosis) in neck and forearms, which indicate the probability of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential way, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they must make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (matals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of UNAM would prevent beaks
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 boats each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphalt floor is the right one, the boats could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his conference A technological opinion of the Basques, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of boats.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight ones, called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weights, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
Asphalt viscoelastic behavior is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes broken down, he added.
The above means that in the streets asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphaltic folder, made up of small rocks bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitute the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
In transiting vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If they were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphaltic folder, there was plenty, a last layer called bearing folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e., a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, you should have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
As the part of the floor that is going to receive and disseminate the efforts, the treadmill also requires the appropriate thickness and the material that is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is wet, the water spreads into the inside of the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a blanching of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of cows.
In the process of forming a bowl, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only then is affected by the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of boats and therefore the thickness of each layer of the floor should always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid frequently forming boats.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the boats with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princesses.
Once again, the Caucasus Valley is left with the wishes of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to make up for being in the podium of winners, polishing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Fräulein Atlántico rose with the crown and the cetro, the department already adds 14 Princesa and Melina titles is one of the legion of Valencian women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what missed?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision of the jury to appoint her First Princess lies in that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Street.
When interrogating the caucacan valley, he replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is "The beginning," is a rather profound book.
I currently read "Crimen and punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood."
A response that little liked first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, he expressed calm and happy with the result, "The universe is wise is what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Beginner" is a great book."
It is said among the hypothesis launched that the favouriteism was burned in Valle.
A Bogotarian journalist suggested that as she was the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who held all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy, public vote for the best craft suit, and Mother Queen), "this aroused the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although he was sure in both of them, he was noticed to be lacking the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist from the "Como en casa" program, of the RCN Canal, felt that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "make sure that the candidate who wins the most wins during the competition does not remain queen."
In addition, Valle showed itself to the last very hijacked with the press, and there it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Contest of Beauty.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury precisely chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queen's Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very well known, lowered points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the vallecacana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"Surgeries are fine, but Valle was not able to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here she was charged."
For this prize, which for the first time handed over the National Competition of Beauty, after the parade in bathing costume came out a cruel Vaticany that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the container Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina has begun a year of reign since today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international certificates by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, was swept away the crown.
This was the work of the drawer that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lopcopist from Cali passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a CTI in Cali passed to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top head of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the cotejo of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ITC section, this week he was given the "availability" shift to Eliasar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
As he began his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in loposcopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliasar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for the Caucasus in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he should identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be of the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take Guillermo León Sáenz's deductible card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter, and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man who came from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the fingerprint
For a fingerprint reader of the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliasar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false papers or do not have papers.
We take the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator told him that in a case of theft, he was touched by a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Marks may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently they found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the killer, it does lie at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "prints are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the ITC expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is played becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective price is made.
The "indignados" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to the Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday in attempting to enter again, under the protection of a court order, in Manhattan square from which they were evacuated in the morning and in trying to occupy another park of the Grand Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access to a court order that allowed the "indignant" to re-camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to go back camping in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and we're going to continue the legal battle by returning to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the "indignant" response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg arrived at the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain camped.
Moreover, the "indignados" proceeded to occupy a new park located in the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already been displaced to show support for the members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned enclosure - is still closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for the same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced up there carried and distributed copies of that court order to these hours and even handed them over to the officers holding the square, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or forbid demonstrators from accessing the park again with shops or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The registrar personally defended the eviction of the Zuccotti Square in the early morning, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "because of their quality of life."
"This morning's eviction was gross and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "favoring respect for freedom of expression."
The Occupying Wall Street officials also indicated that they intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests lasted, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television Christmas
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian tops, it will appear in the TV program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improment", rescuer in "Baywatch", conejita of "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian TV Christmas special.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian top-notch, will appear in the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
Today CTV distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears together with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, an Indian-born Canadian comic who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas has Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "sorra" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Renace after the earthquake
GDP is growing 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ending the drop spiral that began in March.
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has taken place in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to pass the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
Recovery is explained in part by the respite of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by seism and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first downturn after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real reaction of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, trips and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September at the yen's quote.
While markets continue to be visited by the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower its guard.
"There must be attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that the majority of member countries had presented more clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator ahead of the world economy's impact points highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
Since he went down four tenths to 100.4 points, opposite 100.8 August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is at level 100, by falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by genuine political conviction begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the agreed 100-day period in his appointment might be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support any new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday in opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the staff's disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras leaves no doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his visa to any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which was still shocked by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek apple still has thread for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a world-wide preponderant place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the proposal in the last two decades in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose " essence" stated that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in the one whose goal is to halve the volume of people living with income below a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed.
Spain "keep working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assume this task with "responsibility", said Mrs. Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will extend to Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", would be the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many of the achievements achieved" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit raises not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that at the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will leave the poverty line in which they are placed.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Donña Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have seen the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero de los poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic goodwill, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believed that microcredit is "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work on criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to persons "excluding those who all shut the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its gates contaminated with the solidarity spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
On the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, it took place without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat party.
Initially, Europe's future had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was put on the table in autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too strict with the Greeks and could be too strict in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were recorded against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with his speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhil Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country's directive of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Looking forward to calming the spirit within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe focuses on the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The Incidence of Fraud in Disease Lowers
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are engaging in an offence against disease casualties.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and relief.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds one of the axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on disease casualties.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take down.
In short, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that would save EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of unpaid shortage in the event of a loss of employment (to date, they have no shortage, as compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also put the issue of fraud on the table, which is aimed at the abuse of low-work.
"The controls will be considerably increased and, moreover, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand speaking in the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-work fraud.
In fact, since 2002 there has been constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually been successful.
The French are only sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us look at the national figures in the first place.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million was paid in 2006 in employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economy, low subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and occupational accidents, while 54% are related to sickness leave, which amounts to 6.200 million euros.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of the expenditure on health care.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off by illness.
Another study, in this case of Sickness Assurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of sickness leave was less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, the French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch disease casualties.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (both for health and other reasons) fluctuated, in France, between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in disease casualties is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud is quite limited.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to systematic controls of disease dropouts of over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of falls of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adapted or unjustified; a figure of 1.2 million was broken down to 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have taken a sick leave.
Certainly a small figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his Government of union would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed Monday his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, reports the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to that end.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various areas, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient raises that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not match the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, which have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practised, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicated.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not entail a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear to face a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ills.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 can ask for help in committing suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Bachar El Asad partisans spoke yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad's Syria increased, with Russia's support, to resist and denounce that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a Syrian neighbour, have expressed support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "Abandon power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy leader Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East and cannot satisfy their peoples, they will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been "strengthened".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman of the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (SHR).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the sieged city of Homs, as reported by the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem believes that the country is "advanced towards the end of the crisis".
It had also reacted strongly to the Arab League ' s decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in its view constituted "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not flak," he added, guaranteeing that "the plot against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is contained in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to develop the implementation of the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of armed forces from cities in the hands of opposition and the release of detainees.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, judged yesterday as "inaccurate" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan of the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time to markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form their team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to recover the credibility lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a wide program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, having met with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament prior to Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he noted, adding that it is "sure that the markets will have patience and understand it".
Its designation by the President initially welcomed the markets, but then the concern was raised, in particular after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include "political".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he is in charge, he will work in the light of the urgency and the aim of Italy to "recover its protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn noted that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a fiscal balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stricter measures.
The "head of the Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him in matte, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "placed that a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great incognite will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some €200 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "serious concern" with a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
Your company's economic problems would have led you to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Later, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert who did not only know the technique well, but also, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of its career in that technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., by 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in anti-Jewish crimes and a 14 per cent overall increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, the FBI says.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that they have again increased this type of crime and crime," noted the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one organization leader, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and must strive to put an end to these abuses," he said, "as such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people to whom they follow, causing their service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twits", that is, those netizens whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if you follow up messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you like some messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its low instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiators, thus opening up a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the general public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users have debated "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom writes.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" budget into the Constitution
The Government of a large-scale Social Democratic/Democratic coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus to avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social-Democrat Chancellor, Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were to be reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest each year," said Vice-Democratic Foreign Affairs Chancellor Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries last October 26th: in it, the Heads of State or Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and of the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Prior to 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional States and municipalities should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced by 60% as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong one
A new threat to the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the mark of change if the yen continued to grow.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we prove that excessive volatility occurs" in the yen exchange rate, explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massive yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been rising slowly since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refugeal value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crises in Europe.
The dollar back on Tuesday is less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those that led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it enhances the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" following the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (norest), noted Noda, who fears that the root yen's reinforcement of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the right steps", suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion (EUR 47 billion), bringing to the 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
guys grow, bags flak
The risk of debt crisis contagion continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are sinking a little further into the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4 per cent and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and London 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions related to the performance of the loans of the most affected euro area States, the stock markets around the world continue to be part of their recent gains."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional runner at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent, renewing the concerns of market participants in relation to Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed focus on Europe and exchanges will continue to be achieved in a limited range of changes, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized", considers Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost courage after the match of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, is adopted a motion which provides, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types outnumber 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocating with the weight of their debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be his Government's "principal work".
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will take place on Sunday.
The difference of types ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has lowered the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate for an electoral meeting to be the time to reflect on such issues and on the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will double the electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be an increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case either of Belgium, which submits itss to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, as a few examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, returning to the construction of a disrupted power plant after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a speech.
The Berlin election will entail an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, harmful effects will be noted.
The case of Denmark must be considered.
Europe's wind champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest coal and gas users due to wind intermittent; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than those of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realism to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price which the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not show any opposition to that kind of energy in principle, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and which can create non-replaceable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would involve the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of the €6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when the downfall of its manufacturer is planned?
In order to solve the nuclear energy equation, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable CO2 solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing power stations and the construction of Flamenville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the reactor's design and to unforgivable human faults.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the death of tens of thousands.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
As all electric actors who want to build a power plant study, the interruption of their construction in Flamenville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waitresses."
However, it is rarely considered from an economic point of view.
The question is, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the right-wing case, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers," while on the left, the tone fixed Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountainists.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande merely includes trivialities, indicating that the codesarroll will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration undermines growth and harms employment.
The fears associated with the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly those with low qualifications, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are primarily engaged in occupations in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national and most skilled workers in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows represents a rise in real long-term wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of American Nobel prizes naturalized and business like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that an immigrant who reaches 30 years of age in Germany will make a net contribution (early income) of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to look for the points of growth he lacked "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which deterred immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy.
Democracy is a precious but also fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to vote and as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become a "instrument of oppression", as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
We must reflect on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now been displaced and, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer making good progress.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a high to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we do not want to bring out blows of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is in line with the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the momentum of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except to lead us to disaster.
Having fought against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today calls for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
Interest-driven Revolution would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "without contact" chips are generalized
The world lounge of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards phones, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transportation or purchases simply by approaching a card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with contactless chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent about 10 per cent of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 pay terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large surfaces work on four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
In order to put the top gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have undertaken to spread systematically in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the system without contact," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks prove payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out the transactions.
"They're falling back."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We plan to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The agricultural credit bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with around 200 customers and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is rising
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, over which it had been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and reports from intelligence services demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, providing no further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two figures particularly captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other one to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support from abroad and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting in Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of illuminators unworthy of interest.
A quick hit
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is polite and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants are launching the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and the attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and registered 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and then another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more and more succinct statements and shortcuts in foreign politics, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The often unsubstantiated slogans spread over China, Iran, help Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key theme in an overcrowded America for the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "pauses" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
Reagan-like
Romney has also pledged military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragged.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Employer Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he was urging to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "seeks to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. Army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to loosen his piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and their distortions in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he was suspicious of the military interventions that generated a sinking.
And, arguing that it takes economic reconstruction of America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Seabed, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the Baltic shores, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Netherlands counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned the steering wheel of the valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, each year, 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas will reach Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km communicating the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents a victory air.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding land travel by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it by closing its access to Western European markets.
At the high point of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact" in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater supply security.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and West Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against anchorages of ships.
It is based at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields that date from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream society.
In addition, extreme measures were needed to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform in the waters of Sweden was planned, but the project officials gave up on the project, seeing that the Swedish people were not ready to allow a Russian state society to be permanently established in the sea in front of their coasts.
"In case it fails, we'll interrupt the gas pass in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that an escape will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to forecasts, they will have a flight every 100,000 years.
Controlling the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which conducts external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates through the inside of the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one metre, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
She joined the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
Its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been brought to an end by 30 per cent with the contribution of the shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk of spending alone.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, with 4.5 meters of height, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
To total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a trademark.
Founded half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine chart is easily recognized, with its rectangular black pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskin books with the present appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a list of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, by that then company consultant, took charge of the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (top hair), which refers to a tanned cotton that was used, inter alia, to cover banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years has remained far away, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and worshiped.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its beginning, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks into bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the height of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer wallpapers... The brand covers a wide range of media.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the whole population.
Disappointed?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made for fifteen years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"But there's still a lot left to do."
It should be mentioned that the unemployed persons with disabilities continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are older than 50 (a 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not finished the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and "constitute the quid of the problem", says Christian Grapin, General Director of Tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Engrepreneur Association for Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge on low disabilities", with "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of 1987.
According to the latest available figures, they date from 2008, they reach a 2.6% ratio.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for raising the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the establishment number "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that increased contributions has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects true awareness, in particular among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have employees with disabilities in their staff, compared to 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
As we face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party gives them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace at the auditorium of Stade de France.
Five months after the resentment of his frontman against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for its progress and for it to be Belgian."
"I want to move forward," the front of Lille answers.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to settle down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Don't forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been your fan," he says.
That will undoubtedly reinforce especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We've just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Leekens has made reference to pride for his part.
I'm proud to play a gala game.
"Orgol" also to check, as "neighbours", that France "returns to be a very high-level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a wonderful job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share aircraft with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"They can see it in the next parties." Including the party against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal faces with great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selection, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the party of going (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given him the peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, to an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," he says an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 Eurocopa," the successor of Carlos Queiroz has, however, relativized.
The tie of Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could draw a tie, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we haven't marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to exert, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on Bosnians to "let them not think."
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
