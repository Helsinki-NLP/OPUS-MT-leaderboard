The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about taking them for monks.
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently known as AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate came up with plans to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid of being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that the new name ran with Twp and Pwp.
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "poor" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but he pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there's only one small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the English pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on its own members."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation held on these proposals which showed much support for the name of Parliament in Wales.
With regard to the subject of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the choice of MWP received most support in a public consultation.
The AM seems to be suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which he is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the AM disabling rules and the design of the committee's system.
The AM will get the final vote on what they should call themselves when they debate legislation.
Macedonians attend the polls in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent while the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders with whom I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or another."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
When it comes to churches, he fears that the cash in the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they'll be back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods to remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was made with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott at 125th Street Shops, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted to hire and ascend black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they took care of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the charillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world touched by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin's.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some taken by the secular leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the body that governs the parish and which is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "provides the cost" to the board, although it did not participate in the recruitment of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some nuns complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounds a boy while lobster fishing in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help to scream, when he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just emotion for fishing a lobster, but he soon realized he was shouting "They worked for me!
They've worked on me!'
Hammel said he noticed when he came over to the boy.
"I'll tell everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it wasn't a dangerous sort.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for safety reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the big warehouses full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the United Kingdom beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales and household products fall, the largest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that occupied televisions, microwaves and home products on their day.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also get more space with unique areas similar to those seen in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newest clientele.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates to buying small amounts of food daily in small shops implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the settlements will look more and more like shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced points of sale of Argos and Habitat in hundreds of stores, since it bought the two chains two years ago, and this has, therefore, reinforced the sales of edibles and made the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its departments of pharmacy and beauty was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched an initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute over how to divide the revenues of pharmacies into their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel who can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to suit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "furioso" after Holly Willoughby retired from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, left after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from an 11 million-pound business with his life-style brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Peatrow's brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing sparks when he retired from his life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furiate" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he no longer had time to dedicate to both Truly's brand of clothing and accessories.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby traveled to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was unlike one of Holly's priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left astonished all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and textiles for home, and that it could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter in the ITV I'm program at Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We shouldn't talk about his business."
A complicated conversation, and then we fell in love.
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unself of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting his voice as a telexornal presenter.
"I didn't give in."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a major step towards denuclearization in North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, he stressed, the United States continues to impose sanctions directed to continue to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his milieu speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping to free the hostages and bring back the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump pointing to the crowd who had just ahead.
The earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not going to ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumanga.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster management agency, made sure Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that constantly endure Indonesia, the country is extremely ill prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Although Aceh built tsunami shelters, it's unusual to find them on the other side.
Even if an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best case, traveling among many of the islands of Indonesia poses a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's electoral campaign revolved around the improvement of the deteriorating infrastructure in Indonesia, and provided money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line of re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the draw goal in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri still about 27 meters from Chelsea's door with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left leg before he shot the second stick.
The balloon flew over the area as it moved forward to the top left corner of the network.
The ball finally fell upon a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entered the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and gave a touch without thinking too much and I just fired. "
Chelsea won 1-0 on the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard had scored in the minute 25.
The Blue Forwarder passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near the middle change and running into the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the camp.
He took a beautiful step in the deep by driving Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second stick marking a shot at the zurda that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool meets Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of death victims from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning morning.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and which caused waves up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press conference the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman died knifed.
A murder investigation opened after meeting a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to contact us any person near John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera in the box of controls contacting us, as they might have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbor in Birkenhead who was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she found herself that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing relatives closer to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that they won't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
Residents just know they can't go back in a few hours.
He heard a police officer tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying on the scene.
He doesn't stop saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the block of apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at the phone number 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
His prohibition would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and to "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasty of the British civil wars was neither ordained nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell for the wrong actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still meriting homage.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether that is a complete representation or not is the object of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig smashes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a southwest China market.
Last Sunday South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery covered with blood near a cut in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig dog is prepared to put the vaccines to pigs in a stable on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent cut.
He said there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to kill him.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and broken," said the cousin, "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're not very common, there's already been reports of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, producing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos fastened to a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and spooked the animal.
After a farmer of Oregon had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs do not usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disparatizer.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the U.S.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes over the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States over the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, east hour, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane with winds of over 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is hoped that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical humidity north, which will penetrate the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the tide will create abundant and generalized rains in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, the rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west are expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially on much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed character of tropical rain.
We strongly discourage adventure in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and the electric storms will bring locally torn and dusted winds.
The wave will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause the flow of smaller debris and scuba roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season of the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona in the last few hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will bear witness to large temperature fluctuations in the United States due to the Arctic cooling, even though the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves major temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country is expected a warm beginning of October, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could have reached 26 degrees on Tuesday, consisting of approximately 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures higher than the average for the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that was allegedly carried out in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a last-minute Friday new: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, to get the FBI to conduct an investigation in a week's term.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made her touch when he was drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a party in high school.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that it had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other transmission chains, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching television from offices.
To get an idea, it's an audience similar to that of a football final or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on Friday on television.
After the moderate republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being hired by protesters when he was trying to get into an elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
It remained with the low-eyed look for several minutes while being rebuked, live television in the CNN.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said that his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to vote.
But Flake said he'd only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the talks he had with his friend, Senator-Democratic Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation for allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and harm national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the paper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspected Killer of LSU Player · Global Voices
The police arrested a suspected shooter who ended up in the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU (State University of Louisiana).
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the stage and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was charged with US$350,000 in bail.
The forensics office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued Friday a preliminary report indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that came to the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police fugitives' unit, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of local order for his "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 plane was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "buried" and "confused" by Wayde's death.
"That's what worries us all the time," Wade said.
Ash volcano on Mexico City
The ashes that cast the Popocatepetl volcano arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after they detected activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and gray emissions within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing a number of shocks and tremors.
Social media images showed fine layers of gray in the windshields of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers south of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook downtown Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Face between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by the anti-distort police threw them eggs and powdered paint that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that are usually teeming with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that same day with the police, who used the asses to hold the fight.
For several hours, pro-independent groups who ran "No forget or forgive" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independentist region one year after the referendum on 1 October held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters have chosen independence in a way that caressed independence, even though participation was low and the opposite of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop voting at the polls throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independent protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he remarked.
Despite obtaining an adjusted, albeit decisive victory, in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independent Catalan parties fought for the momentum, with many of their most well-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with her mobile phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"Every time there's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They arrest a man after a car had pulled against a house
three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car had repeatedly stopped against a Londonderry house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
Police investigator Bob Blemmings declared the fence and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a helmet might be fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston the 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The ascended Livingston surprised Rangers by taking Steven Gerard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach at the Iberox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to raise a level by place after Hibernian, second position.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they're separated eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be indicted in the sixth consecutive match division; the main coach, Holt, has not yet met the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston lets out opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team must have moved ahead a long time before the moment they marked it, because with its control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his crossfire did not cross the door; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett headboard from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the standing-ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston carried out a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but found himself in an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from rescuer Liam Kelly.
That pattern went on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
The Rangers' guard, Allan McGregor had a shot shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another shot at Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross-passes in Livingston's area were designed to be continuously cleared, while two criminal requests were rejected: one by one hand and another by an entrance from Halkett to the Glenn Middleton substitute.
Livingston's 'phenomenal': analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from stadium Tony Macaroni
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their ascending path.
His style of play and players have only changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of the merit is Holt's in the way he pushed the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led a superbly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath all over the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lacks inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard's orders, on this occasion they didn't get that level.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, a whole call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday September 29 there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany to have lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which seeks to resolve the relationship between NATO's allies.
They have spoken on many issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city congregates the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of their Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to receive them in the country.
The mourning of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was wrapped up in London.
The accident took place near the crossroad between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The car driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a runaway crash at Childers Street just over a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police reported that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison altercation, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m. (Winter time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "We have deployed personnel from specially trained prisons to face an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was known that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers had to go to prison to calm down a riot in which the staff was assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that it will happen in the early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert, leaving opportunities for sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service indicated in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a radius of 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide for 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in the Arizona Mogollón Edge.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Great Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible total isolates of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, for the region is greatly affected by the drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second largest category," saidweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch the ground on the California Lower Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 km/h.
The storm is running out of cold water in the Pacific and so, losing force.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch the land in Mexico with force of tropical storm in the afternoon or on the night of Monday.
It could rain very hard in some areas of Mexico, with a major risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2," reportsweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of her is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwest Desert of the United States," the National Center of Hurricanes reported.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden water trumpets and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder and found a 16-year-old boy with white gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable."
According to Somerset police, three 17, 18 and 20-year-old boys were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, respectively.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on his cell phone.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the pettyness and anger of the Democratic Party
"Vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the "Americans" that day were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an unpopular public service record," he said addressing the multitude of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of republican results in the mid-term elections.
"It's five weeks away for some of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to "oppose and hinder."
It is hoped that the first trial vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, as CNN has indicated an assistant from the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke on the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into the ground to the luxuriant, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
" Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they turned out to be dead," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a dam round in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, house, dragged everything he found," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs broadcast by the national disaster management agency showed many shops and buildings destroyed, twisted and torn bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, seated at the end of a long, narrow bay, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, shopping centers hospitals and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and there's no information" from Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the moment the warning was issued.
In a recording of a shared amateur on social networks, you can hear a man on the last floor of a building shouting frantically warning people on the arrival of a tsunami in the street.
In a matter of minutes the water collides against the kissing by taking forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that caused the cutout of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuated remain urgently in need of food and other basic needs.
The city airport opened again but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds the figure of 800.
It's terrible.
On the way that World Vision staff traveled to reach Palu, where employees rescued themselves in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, watched scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Dosebah.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of ongoing assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing Palu from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from foreign nationals can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Auli Arriani, a voice of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international aid, but it's not yet time."
On the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, relatives and friends of the missing were clinging to the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that alleviates the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday a child was taken out of a dumpster.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidingrs for the Asian Games, who concluded early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the crash of the Roa Roa hotel between the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
They steal $26,750 while reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigator officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car emptyed a cashier in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact the Newport police by calling number 859-292-3680.
Kid Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kid Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former being known as Kanye West."
It's been some time since West, 41, is known to Ye's nickname, which used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance at Saturnday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who canceled his assistance for "emotional reasons," according to the program creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," he said that same year West as he talked about his record with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only, to Ye only, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous foxes who changed their names.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced he would prefer the name Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator from West, JAY-Z, also picked up by putting and removing the script and using capital letters.
AMLO commits himself not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to use military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students comes.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he would no longer use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by giving monthly support to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag the boys into the criminal gang.
U.S. should double the investment in I.A.
According to the investor and professional of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who is employed by Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lack a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it intends to be the number 1 in innovation in AI in 2030.
"Duplicating the budget in research in AI would be a good start, since the other countries are much behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next big advance in AI," said Lee.
Duplicate funding might double the chances that the next AI achievement if it was done in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with the highest score and later he was executive at Microsoft Research at the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized old tech contests from the U.S. government as the robotics challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, says Lee.
"China is not who is leading academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the US push its efforts at AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in AI," he said.
The China State Council published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Foundation of Science and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include partners in industry and university, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee of artificial information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research in AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that was looking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not been moving for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wished to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and block applications for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was, "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU joining the agreement with Greece?"
The advocates of change of name, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to be admitted to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said that they would abide by the result of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state election commission stated that no irregularity had been registered at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters put their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko put their vote on the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Struma, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents for whom the referendum was boycotted.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not through the service door, added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev remarked after filing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required figure.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he'd vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to pro-Western government policy ever since it had access to power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, player in Manchester City, crosses the whole Brighton defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling told of Brighton's defense with 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
This made it ridiculously easy to mark the goal of the minute 65.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton's defenses before he headed to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green sweaters.
It turned out of a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch of the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan slammer with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems on the foot," said the City Trainer, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he'd score at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in confronting the Premier League.
That goal arrived in the minute 29.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass through the gap on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the counterpost.
The blues put the ball in the door before they left the field.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to welcome the Rockies party.
With the Nationals out of the fight for the elimination, there wasn't much reason to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still implications for the Rockies, who are taking an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies secured at least one wildling position with 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they keep trying to close their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opening on Sunday, but apparently Scherzer is the one who throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his number 34, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"We've played everything we did in November.
It's five weeks away for some of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something great, great... I don't have to, but I really do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Here you see this terrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, wickedness, and wickedness.
They don't care who harms, above whom they have to go through to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it to them."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And you've seen that for the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "anxed, valved, disgusting and liars."
He listed the Senate's Judicial Committee citing Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong public apospos.
"Remember your answer?
Filter Document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It's not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of Labour MPs that we're not well received, and all by saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he faced decisive anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the labor meeting in Nottingham East on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour Member, the Friday evening meetings of the committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the labor party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when fellows with whom he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect him to portray me and take positions with which he would never agree, both in terms of national security and in the single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and actually from a bit like that, there's a tremendous shock and attacks on social networks censoring center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just about me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that go to me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how normalized the levels of insult.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "untrusted" movement or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the past few years, I've received a lot of advice that I've been trying to keep my head down, not be so frank, and then "everything would be good for me."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 of them still in school, led by the neglect of Thatcher's government that had literally dropped out of my class, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as local concierge and government minister.
I never hid my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and I disagree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, all I'd say is that while the country is walking towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: A Ayr Indicted
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this pleasant party of the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they're leading the board and it's the only invict team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that the team took him to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've put the test into our party and we're still indicted, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You must recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of opportunities better than our own."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who gave way to the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he turned a solitary shot, leaving the marker 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose began well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the severe injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who abandoned the camp in the spade and, from the beginning, Ayr moved further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain in function of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose got away from having one more player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine essay, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plaque at Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a trial from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo marked, as he did almost since the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in the David Armstrong area and had sent him to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth essay from the local team.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphilll.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craigang.
According to the official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, even though a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosper restaurant business."
'The sea is our': the interior Bolivia expects the court to go to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval headquarters covered in appliances in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned by the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In Bolivia without the sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is still alive, just as the longing to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, since Bolivia expects an international court decision on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX ruling on giant screens all over the country in hopes that the Hague Court will vote in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, is also at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would justify Bolivia, and that it would change little if that happened.
The United Nations based agency in the Netherlands has no power to adjucate Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicates that the case "was not complicated," says the Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could be delayed.
"The topic of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined the good will left to Chile, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have had no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would make an unusually rapid decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open up a new phase of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never renounce her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong states that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it cannot be trusted in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He made a call to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among his leaders.
This comment comes at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to restart the stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War manages to bend to the North.
Washington is holding back from accepting the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalized skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you would like to increase your hat collection or to cover completely from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the walkway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that amazed the public in the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled out their most surprising creations to the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an overcrowded beech hat adorned with a wide fan imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other accessories of great size there were sandals soaked, a magician's hat and even a pine, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and the others a melted ice cone.
And if you're a huge fashion fan, you're lucky.
The trendy ones predicted that giant hats could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter fan that takes the whole world, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks brought to the gateway another great creation: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the model tied up with a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange frog bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the spring 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera in Paris Fashion Week.
The designer of famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope the big hats and beach bags arrive at the shops next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS for their acronyms in English), strive to offer the highest level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that comes to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that the languages are on the highest board and with the highest approval rates in private schools.
About 68% of the students studying foreign languages obtained an outstanding degree.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained degree of honor in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding degree.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Today, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of schools.
A survey carried out by the Employment and Training Commission of the United Kingdom in 2014 indicated that the lack of knowledge of languages constitutes 17% of the reasons why employers are struggling to fill vacancies.
So language skills are increasingly needed to prepare for youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more work opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey of YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others focus on languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that equips children and teams with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may be.
We cannot deny that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron starts with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team trainer, Like Walton, announced that James will play the early pre-time match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still about to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the beginning of the week training, James was asked for his plans for six Lakers matches.
At this point in my career I don't need pre-time parties to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events arrive in Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of 5 meetings scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in cities next to it like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a standing confirmation vote for your candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia to be followed by live broadcast via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the issue of the trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
So, these five myths Trump will give next week are meant to "danimize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible for the campaign season," said Reuters a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
The rally tonight, to be held at Wesbank Stadium, could gather the supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won for over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia in the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until individual Sunday parties
After three individual sessions, the Saturday forsembling in the afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of impulse is a completely invented sports concept but in what sportsmen really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I suppose we take that as a little impulse," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantage points with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a bit of wind in favor and much to be encouraged, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each count three points of four.
Spieth turned out lethal from tea to green and he's preaching with the example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a critical putt to draw the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below two.
By getting the putt that made them win the match in 15, he screamed a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team isn't out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing that's left for these players now.
18 holes to leave behind.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them how the rivals beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win a victory when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended up with the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they were never about to leave.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between the couple, the advice they give, the ones they don't and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe played better as a team until now and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this forsome session has also shown that Team USA has the strength to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on Ryder Cup's last day.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of the fourballs and forsomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to raise four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forsommers, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points of Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four of the four initial matches in Ryder Cup's story.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they fit perfectly to defeat a bloated Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in the modalities of fourballs and forsoms and five consecutives.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the fortballs of the morning, reconvened as his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes facing defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world.
Europe couldn't always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's story where a team picked up four points in the individual, although as a current trophy holder, Furyk's team just needs to tie up to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea reported on Saturday to the United Nations that the continued sanctions increased his distrust in the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing fields and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer from the U.S.," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first."
While Ri resumed the known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization by virtue of which North Korea would be rewarded as he took action, his statement seemed important, since he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump secured the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that first Pyongyang must deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its coercive policy goal, and even if it opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions aggravate our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the chorea peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "man rocket on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking disarmament measures, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that "it's two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council: "The fulfilment of the Security Council's sanctions must continue steadfastly and without exception until we observe the total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't work out well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, just a few hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-type demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students more sleep in order to combat the growth of the Machist culture to study all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic has found that university students number one in the world often know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleeplessness had on learning.
At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do you only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the basics of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a major lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour's duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine when sleeping.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know he won't change the students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the pride of spending all night awake still exists, he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who were involved in sleeplessness were a growing problem.
Ensuring that he sleeps enough and that he has a good sleep must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, marks. I even avoid fattening, as lack of sleep causes his brain to enter into insanity mode, which keeps him hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Also, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disbalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal overthrows Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerard's broken team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Iberox's team intended to record his first home victory since the 4-1 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points away from the Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and a low-inspired Ranger alignment never gave the feeling that it was drawn.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth position, Livingston went up to the third place and was only behind Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have treated for a head injury after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 Livingston that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized group suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the ball.
They might have scored in just two minutes when the short passage of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the camper's center wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful shot free of Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to tie him in the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have had to be penalized at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the old keeper of Ibrax, Liam Kelly, had barely had any trouble with the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the attack of Ovie Ejaria.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute might have been against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher cashed the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his blood cold to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard acted on a break when he changed Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, which almost had an immediate effect when the zurdo made a pass to Morelos, but the imponent Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston kept devouring his visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halfett collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have widened the advantage at the end, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty by cheating on Jacobs, but Thomson made the fat look again.
Almanac: the inventor of the counter Geiger
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACT... was the day that the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring some seemingly unusual cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of Bethesda's National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "pulse the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A approach similar to the removal of immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to approach cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favour of Trump when using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after his appearance in the Saturnday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was added to the studio after a confusing presentation in which he commended the US president, Donald Trump, and said that he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white guy and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I'd be out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire starred by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on the demands for sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Chris Rock went up the images of West's criticism of social networks.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
"They passed by with me on the backs.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
I've been intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to peak?" saying that I would "use my super man hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do." You want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments provoked a stroke at the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication, "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had been appointed to West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has left a lot of people perplexed by an interpretation of song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: GRACES FOR FRONTING THE MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "who it is and that's absolutely wonderful."
So I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the officially known being Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg boy had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last song legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast's restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged for attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhack Love, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in handling the sword like Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31st-year-old actor attacked the male hero stereotype, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems like young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo (#EuTamen) era.
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, when we're wrong about masculinity?" she said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we'll see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't do any precoculation or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to its end in the next summer, saying that enough of horses and battlefields.
As of November, Kit will be the protagonist of a replacement of True West (the true West) by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this program, so she somehow provided me with my future family and my life from here on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects over 820,000 people in the country, declared the health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, on an annual basis, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the disease's transmissions come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters disagrees that a staff member leaked data from Republican Party Senators, "dangerous liars" and "conspirator theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democratic Democrat said that the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultraright".
"Taxes, lies and more infamous lies," commented Waters in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the information disseminated included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a hearing of the Senate panel on accusations of improper sexual conduct against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a Waters staff member, the Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the filtering of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This lie was made with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"It makes sense that he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he mustn't be angry.
You mustn't be defiant.
You mustn't question the defendant's motives.
It must remain pleasant and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the Waters reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if true" shared on a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the entities responsible for compliance with the law and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
"We will make sure to discover the guilty," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Johnny's critique English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and comedy of action of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become the subject of the evidently stupid that we are at the new opportunity of exportation from the nation?
However, the incompetent character of Johnny's eyelids and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-angle cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre glamour pretensions, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean's and a piece of that kind that contributed with a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted Barclaycard's television ad in which he sowed chaos in his footsteps.
There are a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while he's wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor's steps make a brief crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into view, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these kinds of "serious" films, such as 007 and the Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant adventures are not as clever and concentrated as film jokes change from Atkinson incarnating Bean's character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's network of supersecret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent who is on duty, a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the height for a first pompous and in conflict minister, who's already suffering from a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that as all spies are engaged in active activity, you must get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives off-the-job classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They're taking English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meeting with their former, suffering fellow Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a captain of submarine, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batmans and Robins of the misdeeds of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting with the beautiful fatal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in a dangerous way succumbing to the charm of the multimillionaire technological charismatic who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falcons: disguised as chambermaids, set fire to a ostentous French restaurant; they create a tumult that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes total anarchy when trying to use virtual reality helmets to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
Of course, all the arrests come out of that last sequence, but the kind and scandalous way it is, seems to be taken out of a child television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it covers for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five.
Presumably, the party wants entrepreneurs to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers offering them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would continue to receive the same wage.
Sources say that the idea would "adjust" the economic agenda of the party and its plans to tilt the country for workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is hoped that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's focus to balance the economy for the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present the Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day workweek doesn't get into party politics and it's not being considered by this one."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr.McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their investment, since a laborist government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on business councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private-sector companies' shares to employees, who charge annual dividends for up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make you change your mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, in an interview, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring up something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the audience, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be irreplaceable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett roundly denied it," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission, end global poverty.
In his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people visiting the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the 12-year-old Global Citizen to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action or is it just another case of the so-called "Clictivism", people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, boosting a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that until now the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor society and executives who have committed themselves to "help children develop to their full potential", with a promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and supporters of Global Citizen like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history," said the multitude the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach five million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to perform a "block" to hinder energy exports from Russia, announced the U.S. Secretary of Interior
"If necessary," Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including that in the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government operates, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and the means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke then addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called himself the "voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to dealing with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, it's about the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuels," he remarked, at the same time referring to Russia saying that he has "only a tactic" with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "indecent" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "chain" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipeline of $11 billion, which was established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after the meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position gained Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI) called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for the presidency in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that he would carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency after midterm elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and notice the fractured government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
By November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet, "Of course, an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters don't think he's going to show up in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' voters said the Senator would not be running for his candidacy, according to the Suffolk University political research centre survey and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020 include former vice president, Joe Biden, and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, reported the Agency Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes or post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) from Track Palin in Donald Trump's myth
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
Monday night he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through, with what is happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo issue and that his son and other war veterans, "they turn different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for which militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time that he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18 state representatives and the district presented a friendly court report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, told NBC News.
The full name of the petitioner of Grace's prized sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States Union for Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officers refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The district attorney general of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislations."
"The federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be acquiesced according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the American economy, explaining that it is likely that they become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labor".
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"Situation is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of politics on 11 June.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubled in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the slaughtered town of Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured, and the hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I believe," told Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of using "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper asking for the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, made reference to the Chinese Daily payment supplement at Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, when China denies it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get in the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country played in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war as a witness to tariff levels in their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, stated that Beijing has prejudiced workers, farmers and American entrepreneurs.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by broadcasting propaganda ads in the U.S. press for free."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing an announcement of payment at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the post of newspapers located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the differing views that Chinese can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed that it is.
The Kavanaugh disaster causes the female Republican vote to be lost within a few days of the half-mandate election
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the different accusations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the forthcoming half-term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," reflected Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the opponents, in the grip of "Arrive November!", manifested themselves in the Senate hall, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic motivation and enthusiasm will overcome any expectation," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst at the news site.
"It's true that it's already high,
But it's still going to be more, especially among the undecided women voting in the neighbourhoods or those who are between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that it was possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the defendant's bank or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," pointed Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps with the election of the Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the Ford or Kavanaugh witness, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe fully or probably the Ford testimony, compared to 35% that supports the Kavanaugh testimony.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30 percent that thinks the same as Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a college party when he was studying at Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to select where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is an historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, To-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available on a single browser at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access what information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to President John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to enter a complete change that would change their business models from one day to the next.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Homage to Bernard Vann, a cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergy in the Church of England who were decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in their home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honor in a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that he deserved the title.
According to the London Gazette publication, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with a "great courage," led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without help from anyone, and overthrowing three people of enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson like this."
He and his brother James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said to feel "I'm honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll off MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you've been up all night to enjoy the full Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, six of which were the main ones, and was broadcasting live in the UK in Channel 5.
But at 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see their faces, the spectators of the United Kingdom were puzzled when Peppa Pig appeared.
Some weren't impressed after spending so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste."
"The state regulations ruled that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so it had to change to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they'll take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred I started to receive many messages and not all were nice.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll be limited to five fights, instead of six, we'd like to give our fans the most, but we'll go through and
We're very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic jumper, claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to win.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to school.
Invited from the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is sick.
As guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "it was socially unacceptable that you liked children and girls."
He also said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that people wouldn't be disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Australian Commonwealth games to ask other countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The world's three-time champion said he was in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and says the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age he first participated in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar riots.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change her perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
Your son takes the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was an entrance to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell you I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," said Daley.
"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that he was not really invincible." he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he confirms.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, because it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on top.

A Mickelson in low form ended at Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the forsoms of the Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times in the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of their career, at the age of 48 it doesn't fit into the appointed Le Golf National camp, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson is in the 9th Sunday match to the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual matches, start with a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a slap in my shoulder, handed me my arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," said Furyk.
"I fully trusted myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way it is and so we thought it should be.
Like everybody else, she wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual palm tree.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven minutes, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides the team with intangibles.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with energy and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he said.
"I like to see how well the younger players spent it with him this week.
It's a lot more than a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes debuted in 1997 at a party in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up arriving at the target line with a minimal advantage winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for little," Bjorn reflected, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for all of them.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This is not finished until the points are in the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we need to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the world's best players."
Delighted at the performance of their players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we faced another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a companion next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you put the most proof of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to pass on to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Bjorn's difference, Jim Furyk will look for their players to have a better individual performance than with their companions, the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been in both two extremes of those turns of the last day, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser after the European miracle at Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked to remember how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players face to face the last day.
"We have 12 major matches, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see the impulse goes in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We're preparing our alignment taking this into account and putting players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the ranking.
"I've decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed once more
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't arrive until at least next year due to defective systems and increasing cost, they informed local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman for the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will count on a powerful cannon, with different anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the newest frigates up to two years out of the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit rightly points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed in the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
Rheinland-Pfalz of 7 000 tons is thought to weigh twice as much as similar class ships that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed to have reached the amazing amount of €3100 million, compared to the initial €2200 million.
The problems of the younger frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is watering.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament defense committee, recognized that the Navy is running out of boats capable of spreading.
The officer claims that this problem is increasing, since the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new investigation is being carried out on a farm in Scotland's Highlands, which aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of the sound performed by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be drawn up to create a detailed image of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to NTS nature, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and aluminum also pose a risk, as well as trappings with fly glue, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
The bats are not blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, child inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization also has the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, state manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Three we have a large area for bats," he says.
"We count on ancient buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there's a lot of things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on property, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child may kill up to 400 females and females, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still much left to learn about bats and, in the case of many of the species, we don't know how it's going to its people."
Ronaldo dismisses charges for rape and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to meet him using his name.
His lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus front guard was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's good that the footballer paid the woman 37,000 USD so she wouldn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has caught this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, no and a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," said before the camera the five times winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the smiling player.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which qualify as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her annually, according to documents presented at Clark de Nevada County District Court.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying that he was 99 percent a knight, but that 1 % betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both of them maintained sexual relations between the two parties.
Majorga also holds that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later she agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she was terrified of reprisals and was worried about public sarcasm.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the agreement while she continues traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as the world's leading car manufacturing leader after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"You have to come to an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, in the event that Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border might cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for the manufacture of the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced some150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses to how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of EU abandonment without reaching an agreement on the functioning of border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case an agreement is not reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very adjusted, every 37 minutes parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU come in for custom-made cars.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border may be affected and delays and shortages of parts may arise.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace over a day at Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, in order to enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota couldn't estimate how long production would stop, but she warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competency and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsoovallaris, an employee of Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator of the United States, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might start over.
The White House stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and Assistant Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed one more week because of the struggle by the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between the assistants of Russia and Trump, and the possible obstruction to justice by the president.
Whether Trump sacks the Deputy Attorney General or not, which would endanger Mueller's independence, fed the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was late to avoid a shock with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee where they testified to Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of improper sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's allegations of Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
In response to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There's not a fixed date yet, it could be this week or delay another week, given everything that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, as Sanders has been running since September 10 without a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information sessions was not due to an aversion to the grandioseness of the reporters, although he added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not quote any sources that endorsed these data.
Informative briefings will continue, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than to direct the questions to it.
You are witnesses to how we've been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where we can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
However, single press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Secretariat of Health to calm the spirits to Brexit
The Secretariat of Health addressed a letter to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom abandoned the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Fellow members of the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's trainer, informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted when he reached the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a stretcher to perform a subsequent evaluation.
A technician from Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris, WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Similarly, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total tickets on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised to 18 his total season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people because of the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help people without home
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and to focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep in the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second housing and rental purchases, may be up to 3 %.
Fandanda hopes that the change will be able to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy for the first time a dwelling to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, became "Pantastic Cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy is applied just weeks after Boris Johnson requested the application of a cut in the income tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the large builders of maintaining the prices of the high dwellings by buying the land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on the moderate priced houses to fix the "demeanment of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of reform proposals in relation to housing, including the control of renters and the ban on evictions in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the municipalities the greatest powers in building new housing.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a life here.
It is not fair, however, that it is as simple for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, to buy housing as it is for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a dwelling is too far away, and the indignity that supposes not to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's picker at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in Selection B, and that's all," said Ross to the BBC's Sportssound program in Scotland.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will come only if I'm successful in running a club."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's coachship include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic states that he has not felt any concern for succeeding those figures so consolidated in such a large club after rejecting previously proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend on this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely that I'm only successful here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period of duty at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St. Mirren to be about to descend to win the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he's ever found during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because it didn't hurt me, I made a reasonable living and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you must overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from the stress and pressure of work, but I like training.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to an inquiry, the perfect time to take a look is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 percent during July, but food consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's trade adviser, who was responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the world of football for longer periods of time caused a pattern similar to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, even though restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of the restaurants during June has worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than reductions experienced by restaurants.
The pubs specialized in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramaticly as the restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
In pubs and bars controlled the consumption of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals was reduced by three percent."
Paul Newman, employed by the RSM company for analysis of leisure activities and hospitality, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sports events continue to be the main factors related to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent per annum will be particularly painful if it is added to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for restoration business and time will be responsible for telling whether moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breathing for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK trade indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a combined profit of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One in five children (some from just 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to an inquiry.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "false instance"
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some from just 11 years of age) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a growth in the number of "false instance" accounts (in reference to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a "principal" softened account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked her to "violate."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the council of the Scottish federation of athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish federation of athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport if they benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a huge respect within the Scottish community, the UK and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm very eager to speak to athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and who currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered from apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until my degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I now do agility exercises.
Thanks for the courage messages"
An announcement from a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A parent's milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an ad compared to sucking mothers with cows they're muting to.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first silent portable breast milk extractor in the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for the cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like, "Yes, I moved myself, but I have no tail" and, "If you don't notice, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on, "Museum, Mushion, I'm feeding babies, mush, mush, I'm muting my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among the spectators, many of them said that this pos de manifesto the "horores" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to announce this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal bra (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Certainly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers staying with their babies?"
Another spectator added the following: "What an announcement with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even a woman said the song seemed "very funny."
"It seems to me that's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Pulling out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I'll interpret it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement directed to mothers that extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and they feel like cows."
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted in their supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can discreetly fit into a maternal bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out there while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative executive director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative launch.
When describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it implies while we demonstrated in a entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that the Elvie extractor has occupied the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures floated on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children were quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult for the parents to be assigned to the children.
Traditionally, most godfathers were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are patrons or who are part of the home of these people are illegally found in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to prosecute the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require one of these to appear in the court before it has passed a month since its detention in place of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear by videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who fail to meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent shocks or attempts to flee according to the refugees and reports of the system published over the past few months.
The lawyers said that these fears are increasing in centers of greater dimensions such as Tornillo, where there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is going through are being missed due to its size.
They also added that moving the children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could mean a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the U.S. occupying forces, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking to the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were found on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"You must retire immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "out of all illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of the refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were given for his return and he blamed some Western countries for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for reconstruction to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion of Idlib allowed continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would have the Shihadists as destiny, including the soldiers on the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be "eradicated".
The UN envoy of Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draw up a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem exposed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and alerted to possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term?
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many Liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what no doubt would be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, the premium-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, reaching the 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and nearly tripled to the 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time hours, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the audiences of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights in which important news occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, drama showrunner for the ABC "Designed Survivor," which is a secretary of the ministerial cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? asked him.
"He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment inside chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the plots around Washington can determine the future of the Roe anti-Wade case, if emigrant families can meet again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it's something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich bomber jacket ("a gift full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's frightful descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with changes in the everyday characters and spins of Trump's show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house, on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
He wasn't able to get out of it while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows at that time and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to lots to finance parliamentary candidatures for half-legislature elections
It's no surprise that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional District with two representatives serving in careers to occupy the same position.
This district located on the outskirts of Pittsburg that was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who obtained his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb stands against another representative in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania determined in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congress's Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning an adjusted victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed extensive follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then dropped back.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw into the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to order to return to the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million of US aid during 2017, included to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, United States and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid people's emigration towards the United States.
But in mid-September, important administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being applied to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance of the administration, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations always and when the participants' anonymity remained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction to Mr Trump's justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
According to the record, Mr. Mueller is also directing his research to discover whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to render accounts in that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They're many incognito, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to give a coup against Hitler if the western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accruing or backward.
The Americans face several of these points of inflection right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump sacks the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has declared that The Times' information is not true.
"How are we going to respond if the F.B.I. investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it confirms its appointment to the Supreme Court despite critical accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in half-legislature elections for a Congress that demands Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecholovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to lock Shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is optimistic about the meeting against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers received the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against the Villarreal this month, would place them in a very favourable position to qualify in the Group G of Europe League.
An injury on the knee prevented the camper Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and get a point.
We've had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our audience, I am sure that we can fight for a positive outcome.
Last year it was hard between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made on the team, but there is an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget the past season and succeed."
Women are concerned about savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear as they wanted to be looked after, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their couples on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of her, but they're not taking the necessary measures to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Department of Nationwide.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them your wishes in advance.
He collaborates with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to get care, since these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Long-term care funding options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered by your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you're not able to communicate.
It also appreciates the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be in a position to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Please note in detail that information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors attending?" asked Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."
A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place at approximately 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, resulted in the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cutoff of communications, rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the Donggala residence, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a Regency that lies along more than 300 km from the coast north-west of the island of Celebes.
This region, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main piers of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the Pacific Fire Belt of Seismic Activity, so it suffers from regular earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which took place on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees magnitude struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, situated opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regiment of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died from the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily taken away.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was detained under suspicion of a crime of domestic violence, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility units with $500 bail, according to KTU.
He stood before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when he was asked, reported the prison.
Palin faces three minor crimes of type A, which means he could go to jail for a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor crime of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska War Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of drunk weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of putting a punch in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder that she suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia provokes hundreds of deaths
They count at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of deaths is expected to rise by the passing of the days.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Iacarta.
There are videos circulating around the partner networks where the impact moment is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal tax seeks to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, following the life of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious "intentionally" injuries, according to the notification of the intention of requesting the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court's document.
Weeks after the attack occurred, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by the prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," they declared the taxes by describing the way Saipov carried out the attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intention of indictment.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, New York's Southern District doesn't process a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he displayed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was found not guilty of the accusation of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers charged with representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton remarked.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Member of Parliament tory states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the conference tory.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Mr Peter Bone said in front of Birmingham's protest that the United Kingdom would 'be gone' from the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit, the opposites and the EU.
Their allies insisted that they continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end with the Chequers plan.
He suggested that you should have told Mr Farage to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he had been given the post, we would be outside the EU at the moment,’ he said.
The Members of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing their opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone denied the suggestions which indicated that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wanted to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the tories and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also came to the march, since he told the reporters: "All I'm saying is, first minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity between public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones that occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening’.
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians 'feel uncomfortable' if they intend to betray the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
"This is currently a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists posted banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy a free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit's good concept doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself to the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider his candidacy to the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be present at the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It's focused on speculation that puts it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the Town Hall format since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce the president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that it takes a woman in the presidency."
A detention was carried out related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the player of LSU
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the basketball player at LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (East time).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who came out of the pictures.
Yes, 20-year-old, he was shot near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.

Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.

Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton comes to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that orders of Mercedes team would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left from the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxing first and let Hamilton run traffic in the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxings some time later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to be reluctantly released the inside risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went up to the seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get faster at the end and advance Kimi Raikkonen by the fourth position.
He finally went into boxings in round 44 but couldn't advance any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An Unadequate Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein in an event he held on Saturday for his insistence to state that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech made in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, repulsive and liar".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see the indignation, when you see that people who are angry and miserable, repugnant and liar," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you done any filtration?
Remember his answer... have you filtered the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it out?...No.", he added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent her the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration had come from his office.
"I haven't hidden the charges of Dr. Ford, I haven't filtered his story," Feinstein said to the committee as reported in The Hill.
'I asked him to keep his confidentiality and I did what he asked me to do'.
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he has used the worst body language I have ever seen in my life".
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to hit to regain power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars noticed the defeat suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early advantage with two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the local set before Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before two Lundvald Nielsen goals allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to get back to Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories before the Giants.
The initial goal of Dwyer occurred in the minute 3:35 thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a busy initial period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the goal of tie 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead of the marker before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.

Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined together to help Nielsen advance the Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the victory through the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a large earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people trapped under the cliffs of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunanang Grand refused to leave his post at the control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri in Palu that was swinging violently.
He stayed in his post to make sure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, stated that it is possible that this decision allowed hundreds of lives to be saved, reported ABC News channel from Australia.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we are buried,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance of victims is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the debris and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six metres devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
Drinking water was scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" he informed CNN.
Indonesia had suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which over 550 people died.
Air Niugini now claims there's a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously stating that the 47 passengers and crew had abandoned without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Ships from the area helped rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before arriving at the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the landing track from a distance.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," commented Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached them to the waist up to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and scared, and that he suffered a slight wound in the head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that some sailors who were working near the place in the improvement tasks of a dock also helped the rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution referred to the evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recapture the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was meeting with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stage on Saturday and testified that that day he was not in the city that day.
When the D.A. asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he declared he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "misleading, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed he'd known Chambers for about two weeks after he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett declared that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"It's ruined in your life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defence will begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A three-hop hip wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling up its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and a struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common recently experienced a rejuvenation in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?!
A New York child nurse demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child nurse will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be directed to her from the mother in which she complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her anguish to discover that the babysitter Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NIGHT," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and who had hoped for a Filipino according to the announcement of the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day and was sent home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and requires a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which they had initially been hired even if there was no contract by means.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," he said to the Post on Friday, to add later "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, because they were afraid they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife had sent him a message she had no intention of sending.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, though they had been due to a mistake?
Your baby just been born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are they going to go for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the public court has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them by their behaviour and the applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as one can conclude in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to get on a person's skin to read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
After asserting that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic at the possibility of his refusal to work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pretty" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to which he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it.
I think I felt the success of Paddington a little like that.
Even though it was a creation of his and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye through the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was driven quickly to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save his life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me I was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had been dead a while before and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapered, at that moment of mourning over the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the plight she was suffering.
"No one detected him," he said.
"He had his head down and tears fell on me all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity with Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Posts of distressed women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression, and he killed at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel the way I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room."
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was what his brother found after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented, "I am concerned that there is still a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards to inform people that there are people to whom you can go and to talk, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment that he was sad or depressed or anything like that," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day hit the bottom (when the children opened their presents, he made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He stated that his death suffered a tremendous trauma to them, but they must overcome him: "He torn the family apart.
He gave us away.
But we have to keep going forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thread while the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what we were asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), we might be able to get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "disrupting" because of the paralysing of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do the investigation?
Your reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
There are five weeks left for the elections of half a lexislature (the 6th of November). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under Kim's mandate
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong Un's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seuug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said 1,127 deserts occurred last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the hardening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people responsible for passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
Most deserters in the North are finally offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run across China, which has the largest border crossing of North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers the deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them compulsoryly.
The relationship between the north and the south (which are technically still at war) has improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to maintain talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work very hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States on the lack of progress ever since.
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will be unilaterally disarmed first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says it's inappropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the "historical" Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and assured him that he was not appropriate for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelesi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman were ever to behave like that, she would call it hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to the Kavanaugh statement in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial declaration, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost screaming and remaining speaking while describing his family and school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, cataloging the accusations against him as a "murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
So he said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way in which he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
So he objected when he was asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed at the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not right to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court in which you are currently standing," said Pelossi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
So he added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh might adopt against the law of protection for patients and care for accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh dismissed questions about the annulment of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to access the court and still above waiting for us to say, look how well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a just-justified Tuesday, months and years of fury overflowing, and you can't expel her without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem, 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that was that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might be thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a escape valve for anger in part because they essentially don't understand.
One of my most sharp memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of her neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," he said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an adventure outside of marriage on a boat named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why he could not consider presenting himself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," I remarked in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancanves and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraisers, so he swore he would not enter the presidential race unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported him, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address the voters instead of the delegates and angered by the existing sexism) that he ran out of words.
"You'd think I'd suffered a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How trade war between the United States and China can turn out to be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were shocking, and even though the war is far from over, a distancing between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming from the United States from China.
Beijing has counter-attacked at the same time, the most recent, rising tariffs from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will be mutated in the short term.
To get Washington to jump back, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but to bend publicly to the United States would be far more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing is able to play its letters correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia Center for New American Security, a research center.
Syria is "listed" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it's ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions are provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help he can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the American team by a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and it has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16th hole of pair 3, losing his departure against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players that got a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-class player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first one in the world's ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get my drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped," said an excited Garcia after European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of the Tiger Woods Golf by 2&1 in the individual Sunday party.
"It's incredible how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I've grown to see that boy play," said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, the winner of 14 majors, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble throughout the weekend not getting out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf all over the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put Europeans in trouble.
We fight.
I'll take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganise, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll get ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get your hat out.
They were superior."
