Cumulative rapidly progressive incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for a outbreak of patients with ICDOC-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of unknown etiology pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Disease Control and Prevention Center reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-COV-2 infection has been called coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, VOCID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom, and compared them to those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The Eurosurveillance 2020 edition of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported between 31 December 2019 and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of cases of VOCID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of notified cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to compare them to those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of notified cases in each country up to 15 March 2020 at 8h, and compare with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed those of the Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It stresses that, by 15 March at 8am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in actions of national public health systems and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for cases of VOCID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to the saturation of the health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity of intensive treatment beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of ECDC on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-COV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, especially intensive treatment, such as in affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility of intensifying their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the next few days or weeks.
The disease epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80 thousand people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a disaster to the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-COV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide an ongoing and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which develops rapidly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined to the whole holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
When relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other CoV disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice found highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-COV and MERS-COV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of COV in the documented history of human beings.
As shown in Fig. Fig. Fig.1.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin were initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the health care professionals were informed, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan sea-fruit market, which was considered the starting site of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until now, the disease has spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
Since the situation is rapidly worsening, the size and final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people of all ages, especially in the 30 to 65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the appearance of symptoms.
The mean period of incubation was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and encapsulated subfamily of viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope joins its cell receptors of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4) for SARS-COV and MERS-COV respectively, and thereafter the membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of viral RNA is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through the electronic transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultra-fine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was discovered that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-COV-2, as well as SARS-COV.
However, SARS-COV-2 S protein joins human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than SARS-COV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 contains no known domain or functional motif.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the human ECA2 cryo-EM structure of total length to resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
It was discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection with CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for the screening of medicines to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two coVs of bat-SL-CoVZX45-like bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of species and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, in China, suggested that pangolins, elongated seal mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete tests are being expected (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly unknown yet.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported in relation to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system by means of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in defending cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T-cells.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for the fight against viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-COV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of free local radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at the worst of the hypotheses, multiple failure of the organs, and even death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects more elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and varied from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that the health authorities adjust the actual quarantine time based on the most accurate period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected by it usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, chore, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after symptoms of the disease appeared.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the lung image diagnosis, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of the higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 35%) and throat pain (13% to 35%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS until November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic number of reproduction R0 of SARS-COV-2 was up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95%, 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-COV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARS-COV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
The appearance of symptoms in a grouping of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or in other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it was reported that people may carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who received discharge from hospitals may contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white peripheral blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count showed progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present irregular bilateral shadows or opacity in dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromises the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the lung capacity to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most serious results of chest X-ray usually correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the pneumotic deformation, the formation of the hyaline membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sinicial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang described a SHERLOCK, CRISPR-based protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide, in the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, at the same time as they try a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-COV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (BCE), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-COV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response directed to T cells; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF block; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They may cause severe side effects, mainly osteonecrosis avascular, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for cautious use in patients with severely ill COVID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with rendesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Reddesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
Blood collection of patients who have cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from the contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients treated usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured from ICDOC-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Her symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the large-scale method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be considered cautiously.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is large for treating patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or is vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Province of Hubei, which used TCM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and working colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with western medicine and the combined treatment of western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by western medicine.
The worsening rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by western medicine and by TCM than in the group treated only by western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still await more duly controlled tests on larger scales and more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the action mechanisms and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease usually feel a great fear of highly contagious disease and that can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
Moreover, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
The screening of mandatory contacts and quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they can feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people with suspicion of the disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission of animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop S-based vaccines to generate potent and durable neutralizer antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-COV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the lethal challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical study begins.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunal individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive treatment (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-COV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 may also be combined with positive ECA2 colangiocyocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CPR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also assist in predicting the result.
These enzymes are present in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other questions for predicting outcome/complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as an attached therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short time in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the epidemic of COVID-19, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainties, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at the initial stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-COV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring at the initial stage.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornetto rubs of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified may become an influenza-like cyclic episode.
However, promising indications occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was maintained under control, finally.
It is possible that SARS-COV-2, in the same way as SARS-COV, may become weaker as to its infectivity and, at some point, becomes a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-COV-2 is highly transmitted by cough and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in feces, which generates a new possibility: oral-fetal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, coworkers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series no. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets of a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or stick to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series no. 1860s) protect against the inhalation of virions with sizes of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
As the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series no. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care professionals should use isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-COV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a great alert to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproducivity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for disease containment in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this harsh lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals, instead of waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its initial stage, instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently issue targeted and effective simulations to increase the public's awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The epidemic of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-COV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a feedback sensation of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which generates a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA trial for SARS-COV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of bats similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to Questions Nos 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also connect to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot obtain a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a world pandemic, disappear like SARS or will it have seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and so many others.
However, regardless of the effort required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have boosted the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCOVs) caused a mild disease, such as a common cold.
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought of CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an infection with HCOV can be.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-COV.
HCOV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCOVs is extremely useful.
Most HCOVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCOVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
The investigation of the CoV host's interactions in animals can also provide important information about the CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of existing information about the seven HCOVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery, as well as its zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparisons and contrasts between different HCOVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current CoV disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the development of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple taped RNA.
These viruses that have the greatest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in electronic microscope.
As for the structure, the CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two open-reading overlay structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are reprocessed and generate 16 non-structural proteins, nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific bonded proteins are also encoded by different CoVs strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the genus betaCoV contains the majority of the HCOVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and newly identified SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively greater number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from the cortex of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, and both cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCOV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of today and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCOVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCOVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCOVs provides a structure to understand natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search by reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCOVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parental viruses of HCOVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of evolution of HCOV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by reduced pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCOV-229E strain B814 from the heart of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E presented common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into mice' brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E developed a common soft cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients exhibited severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCOV in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-COV, the third discovered HCOV.
The first SARS case dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
Except for "superspers", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two other people, with a period of incubation of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and creatine kinase high are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in the number of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which may be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a zero-patient relative travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Chore, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis symptoms are common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, he is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its incidence of peaks occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in a community way, it was reported that HCOV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Just like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four HCOVs acquired in a community way have adapted well to human beings and are generally less likely to suffer mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported as causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to keep continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-COV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by the laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases, of 34.4%, which made MERS-COV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
Half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, who knew retrospectively were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continued epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-COV-2 an Emergency of Public Health of International Importance and also named the COVID-19 disease.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to the confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside the city is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as well as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they come together in different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCOV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-COV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-COV and the severity of the four HCOVs acquired in a Community way (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during HCOV infection acquired in a community way, including the presence of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-COV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in the HCOVs acquired in a community way and in the SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCOVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed that the transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 decreases after passing on to humans, as in the case of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, in the same way as other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-COV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to discover whether SARS-CoV-2 can display seasonality, as in the cases of HCOVs acquired in a community way.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its transition to humans, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All HCOVs acquired in a Community way that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of old HCOV pandemics.
HCOVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious HCOV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCOVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other measures of infection control.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-COV and MERS-COV, highly pathogenic, did not adapt well to being human, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-COV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the four HCOVs purchased in a Community way.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as HCOVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCOVs acquired in a community and less pathogenic way than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will completely adapt to human beings and will circulate between us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCOVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and HCOV amplifiers.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCOV if it has a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host shelters HCOV continuously and sustainably.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural HCOV hosts or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV is newly introduced to an intermediate host soon before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt properly to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
A HCOV may have the infection interrupted if it is unable to sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that SARS patient zero had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-COV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civetas (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guexinim in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of viruses similar to SARS-COV.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masquerade palm civetas or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that maschasing palm civetas could only be the amplified intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as mid-range hosts ampliating the SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a CoV of narrow relation bat, named CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus bat related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat-ferrad.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other CoVs of bats share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-COV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except for WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that human angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is the receptor of SARS-COV.
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from faecal samples of bats uses ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as a receptor for cell entry.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the ancestor closer to the SARS-COV in bats, sharing 95% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-COV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-COV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 of bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNA polymerase sequences dependent on MERS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to betaCoV counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-COV and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-COV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-COV-specific neutralization antibodies, in the same way as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal rubs, increasing the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that usually mild symptoms, but with massive virus transmission, were observed in camels infected experimentally with MERS-COV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed, plausiblely, to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a RATG13 bat coV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the divergence in the sequence between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is very large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs are almost identical with bats in the future.
Intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are supposed to be among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to human beings.
Several recent metagenic sequencing studies suggested that a group of small mammals threatened with extinction known as pangolins (Javanic Manis) could also house ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RATG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped in virus-like strains similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study of patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curative to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility of pangolim being one of the midlife hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence confirming the direct origin of the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolim due to the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-COV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 share the highest extensive genome sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between betaCoV-DRS of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 results from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument is in favour of the recombination between betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have originated from CoVs of bats, while the parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV of bats called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another CoV of bats, called Hipposiders/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that camels are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCOVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interpecial HCOV transmission events throughout history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interpecial transmission history of HCOV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCOV-229E have been discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the bat virus to humans.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphaCoVs of bats related to HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alphaCoV of alpacs caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas obtain from humans the alphaCoV related to HCOV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCOV-229E, alpacas and dromedaires can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interpecial transmission of bats to dromedary and dromedary to human beings.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-COV from bats is known in its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interpecial exchange of genetic fragments and interpecial transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of the MERS-CoV in the dromedaires dates back to decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-COV is a cause of a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of the MERS-COV, as their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-COV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-COV-2, is different.
Specifically, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a betaCoVs-related terminal host, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-COV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through the slaughter or coal mines.
Second, the pangolins could be one of the amplified mid-hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been newly introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced by domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has both contact with bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the CoVs to cross the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single tape RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates can be considered from "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclide with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inadmissibility.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of CoV by inhibiting this exorribonuclide and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Reddesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, CoV mutation rates are almost one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-COV-2 mutation rate is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has adapted to another host that keeps in touch with human beings.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to the dromeders.
In theory, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-COV-2.
Secondly, the great genome of RNA in CoVs exercises an extra plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and combinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading tables and encoded protein functions compared to the last three inches of the genome end.
Third, the CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique mechanism of "copy choice".
In a host serving as a mixing container, tape exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidences of natural recombination were found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs, such as the SL-CoV of bats and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoVs isolates of humans and civetas, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes a rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-COV, DLR is in the 318 to 510o amino acids in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2, as well as its corrections for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize ECA2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and dogs-guaxins, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral and civet isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the reason for connecting the receptor to the ECA2 receptor.
The Civeta SARS-COV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of protein spike interaction with human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-COV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-COV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of binding your S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than between human ECA2 and SARS-COV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrector may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing the fact that HCOV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of S protein.
There are several other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCOV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylate for HCOV-OC43.
They could also respond for the effective adaptation of these CoVs into human beings after interpecial transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCOVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and natural reservoir hosts of HCOVs such as bats, dromedary and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host's restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of host-virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-temptive screening at the level of host dependency genome and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCOVs Rise: Back to Zero Stack
The diversity of the CoVs of bats provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In this sense, the CoVs of bats serve as a genetic pool of HCOVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also drive the evolution of HCOV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically change viral phenotypes.
Among the accesory proteins of SARS-COV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since the bat viruses related to SARS-COV were isolated, but it was found that they codify divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of excluding the nucleotide 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternation of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and rangeCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination events were also observed in other HCOVs, in which HCOVs are combined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from relief of selection pressure exerted on the viruses, such as host's immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While the intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, the alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCOVs is also driven by the pressure of selection in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when they were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
The bats are likely to be well adapted to the anatomically and physiologically CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminating cells inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and to the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROEs) generated from high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress replication of the CoV and affect exorribonuclide review, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the host's adaptation.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
In this document we find the explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from the replication of the CoV.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon's response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While it was discovered that betaCoV of bats shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-COV, there is a CoV of bats that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been discovered that civetas and other animals in the markets are containing viruses identical to SARS-COV, intermediate hosts for SARS-COV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of the pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is produced by accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic and animal reservoirs of HCOVs in transmission between humans.
Evidence of wide diffusion shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civets in the markets, wet markets closure and civet slaughter in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple strains of betaCoVs of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of this transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in dromedaires for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombin, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from ecological niches of the natural zoonotic virus reservoirs.
Several parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to discover under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission to human beings, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the real intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, a pangolim or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Further research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide for the diagnosis and treatment of infection of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and is a good reference to combat this world pandemic.
However, the coronary virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guide and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, COVID 19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context of some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this world pandemic.
We embrace their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest COVID 19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history elements with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of VOCID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms coming from the city of Wuhan and from nearby areas or from other communities where cases of VOCID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed group of cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) diagnostic imaging resources for COVID infection-19; (3) total white blood blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the initial stage of onset of symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-COV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronary artery; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-COV-2 in serum examination; or some change of specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 negative for positive or increased titre greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (18-22 January 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth edition (from 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and samples of the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence to remind us of paying attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, since it classifys the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they check and obey the most recent guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also timelyly update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute of Epidemiology, Control of Diseases and Research in Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dha.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be stopped for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This paralysing of public transport began on March 26, and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 exceeds one million worldwide infections
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the world increased from one million, indicated the data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This frame came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases 24 hours before 10 hours at Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, connected to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced more rigid measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until 1 May.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without appearing at work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency within 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the duration of the touch to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 15h to 6h.
Thailand plans to implement pickup from 22h to 4h
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home by May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce toilet paper limits by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday nights, Australian shops networks Woolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and one package per transaction in all shops in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a limit of a package.
These limitations were communicated by messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposed to store in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper with home delivery to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "without precedents", while ALDI called it "unexpected" on a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "increased increase" last week, according to a Woolworth spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To further ease the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages of suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI previously made available stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varejists, said that retailers try to increase stock, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make it difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some shops will not be able to carry out Wednesday's promotion.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that shops return the stock every night.
He pointed out that the toilet paper is a bulky item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if there were an abundant amount on the shelves, if produced as rolls of toilet paper and antiseptics could be [buyed] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Givens the Crap said last Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces the Kleinex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces the Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to news.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being made with buyers entering strike on the extended weekend of the Work Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily print, included an eight-page insert with the aim of being cut and used as a toilet paper.
Initially, shops were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, soaps for hands and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the hygiene paper Andres for two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID pandemic-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to drive governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and about the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centers, is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside the influenza, no other respiratory virus was monitored from the onset to the continuous global dissemination".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus."
And he went on, "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the decision of January of WHO to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international concern.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, "in short, will get worse."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 pandemic of coronavirus is a continuous disease pandemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth by coughing, keeping people apart, and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
The authorities around the world have responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, pick-up touches, workplace risk controls and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socioeconomic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by the purchases triggered by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the student population in the world.
Disinformation about the virus spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance of eastern and southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus occurred.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the wholesale fruit market in the sea of Huan and, therefore, it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close connection with the coronaviruses of the bat, pangolim and SARS-COV. The first person with symptoms of which he was known was ill on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the later group of the seafood market.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had links to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 years or less, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's main scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not to test people only with mild symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that, until January 23, China estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the cases reported.
The initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it can be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official count of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much larger, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, in homes of rest, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDCs) recognized that "we know that [the official number of deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episode reports of underreporting in the US. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths in all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of persons diagnosed dying due to a disease, and the lethality rate of the infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific infection population through case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the mortality rate of infection for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, stated that, "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the time when this will happen."
The senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it can end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-COV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for a year or two."
According to the study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially within 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it can become a seasonal disease, recuring every year."
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on the immunity of the group and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and the infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results from the tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who were in close contact with a person with confirmed infection are monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spreading are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the close contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing drops can also be produced during the expiration, including when talking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets can lay in the mouths and noses of people close to them or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions nebulization, resulting in air propagation.
The spread may also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches in his own eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is a concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The government of China denied the possibility of oro-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days prior to the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) establishes that, although it is not entirely clear the ease with which the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related to its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacronavirus, subgener Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same line are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity throughout the genome level to other coronavirus samples coming from bats (BatCoV RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolins virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the whole genome, so far, has found, at most, 92% of genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and SARS-COV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (TC).
A study done in Wuhan, comparing RRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coincidering with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the CT is not used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase reaction and chain (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are normally available from a few hours a day.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal rub, although the throat rub is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been sufficiently precise to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved to be used as an emergency test only by certified laboratories.
The peculiarities of X-rays and computed tomography (TC) images of symptomatic persons include asymmetrical opacities in peripheral dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared thoracic CT results to those of PCR and demonstrated that, although the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a tool for investigation in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of imaging characteristics of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to avoid the transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper sheet and placing this sheet directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel going to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals are advised to care for individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by localization data governments from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Anistia International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, for example, rinse the nose and gargarez with colutories, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working to develop one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty. It should also wash their hands before eating and after sucking the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (up to one minute exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, isopropyl alcohol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5% and iodopovidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a place, such as an office or a daycare centre, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering their mouth and nose with the elbow folded or with a paper sheet when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discard any sheet.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask can limit the volume and distance of expiratory droplets when talking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands."The use of masks has also been recommended by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are under high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the USA, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (take 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to use a surgical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
The health authorities of Thailand are encouraging people to make facial masks of cloth at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam called for everyone to wear facial masks when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear masks for face in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of masks for the face is compulsory when going out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who could not afford to buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone when they stay at home, limit their travels, avoid crowded areas, use uncontacted greetings and keep away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of transmission of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" by "physical distancing", to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or at the distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" led to implications that social isolation was necessary completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies issued detailed instructions for appropriate self-insulation. Many governments demanded or recommended autoquarentine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions of autoquarentene were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a large-scale country or region that make 14 days of autoquarentine since the last possible exposure were advised.
Strategies for controlling a outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is performed in the preliminary stages of a outbreak and aims to trace and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
The suppression demands more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproductive rate below 1. The management of an infectious disease outbreak, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
Thus, the risk of overload of health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions other than pharmaceuticals and which may administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks for face and autoquarentine; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events leading to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, remained in quarantine and travel bans were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to ensure that the spread of the virus is limited.
South Korea, for example, presented the mass screening and the located quarantines. Furthermore, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they made the autoquarentine, and for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those storing medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the epidemic growth) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, at the same time overloading health systems.
The suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if that occurs before. Otherwise, the transmission occurs as soon as the measurements are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicinal product that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicinal products, which include testing existing medicines.
The use of cold medicines that do not require a medical prescription, drink plenty of fluid and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of fluids or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO describes the increase in the capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to allocate, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with a positive test for COVID-19, as well as the increased capacity of intensive care through training of personnel and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dated December 1, 2019 in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronaviruses in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market of fruits of the sea of Huan. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at the provincial hospital in Hubei. The next day, the doctor informed the Center for Prevention and Control of Whan Jianghan Diseases.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a "sARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reproved by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was repressed by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The City Health Commission of Wuhan, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to the health authorities of Wuhan to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the Chinese new year and by the fact that Wuhan is a transport center, as well as a main point of railway connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later officials showed that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States passed China and Italy, with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
On the basis of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as house confinement orders, home containment orders or lockdowns) and pick-up touches. On April 2, some 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case, dated November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26. His hospital reported the Whahan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27.
Initial genetic tests on December 27, 2019 in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A statement to the population was issued by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police by "scattering rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission among human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on 23 January to interrupt trips from or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year's celebrations on 25 January were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshhenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Leishenshan, was subsequently built to care for more patients.
Together with the newly built hospitals, China converted another 14 Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centres and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the expansion of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools of the whole country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) went through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its overall phase in March, the Chinese authorities took rigid measures to avoid the "import" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in that case, by means of a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, the Chinese prize, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China's Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details about when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their tributes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were placed in quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline schedule was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized program in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked and placed in quarantine those who came into contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile app, a trial of the virus by drive-thru, with results available the next day, in addition to the increase in test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
The South Korea programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not put entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or by challenging their response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1 all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Rials to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel among the cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic among the cities before the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the midst of the allegations of coverage of Iran's outbreak extension, more than ten countries tracked their Iran-related cases on 28 February indicating that the outbreak extension could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch vehemently called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body claimed that there is a higher risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions as detention centers, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 active or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested that economic sanctions be alleviated to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of shock, entrances and exits of people are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities in the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the football matches of the A Series, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics in relation to the screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy moved to China as the country with more Coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military planes with medical supplies to Italy.
From 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the region of Lombardy.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus until then may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the softest in the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential and social contact travels, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distancing measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police by the issue of fines and dispersion of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, ferry shops, gas stations and car workshop.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the U.S. government's leading public health institute — announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start to the tests, which concealed the true extension of the outbreak at that time.
The test was marked by tests kits with defects produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for test kits that were not from the government (of academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested until the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).

On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered the prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to prevent panic near the festivities in the new lunar year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a recommendation of the WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, after the confirmation of the transmission of humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as the International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.
The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, said that PHEIC was invoked due to the "risk of global dissemination, especially in low and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "have no systems in place to detect people who contracted the virus, and even if it arises".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community to "invite now or will have to pay later." On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated, as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO declares will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak."
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide support to international experts and WHO on land in China and to evaluate "the severity and communicability of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and to undertake field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", stating that, although it was very early to declare a pandemic, countries should also introduce "a phase of preparation".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the Coronavirus threat at global level would be high from "high" to "high" is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that the current data did not allow public health officers to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned with alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and with alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, to submit his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for each individual's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to interventions to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people arrested, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracer, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Directors at the province level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed because of their approach to efforts related to quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the Coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories on COVID-19 originating in the USA or Italy.
The administration of the U.S. Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which in turn was condemned by some critics as racism and "a way of diverting the failure in the administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast achieved a detailed communication strategy from the U.S. government with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy cited as "That's all about China.
We were advised to try and get these messages anyway, including press conferences and TV appearances. "Canals such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a trendy and 'generous policies' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively disclosing the message that, unlike the United States, is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by the sanctions of the United States on April 3.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other nations for their own country.
And there are disputes relating to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China replied bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitics and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the region of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio have dispensed with the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical supplies to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the people of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen active or ex-political political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the world's leaders, asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipated that this might negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-elected as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's ambiguous and passive efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a forty-two-week place designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions asking for Moon's impeachment in relation to what they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to approve emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered having spread false news about the virus and crisis management by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, resulting from the increase in the use of equipment in a global way to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration issued warnings about drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the panic-motivated shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including supply shortages.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO general director Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would endanger the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daigou, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures adopted by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that has been planned in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reservations for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very hit in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and sales in the retail fell 20.5%.
Since Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing center, viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that the markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of 300 billion dollars on the supply chain in the world that could last for up to two years.
The Petroleum Exporting Countries Organization (OPEC) allegedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average have demonstrated their most significant falls since 2008, with the fall of Dow at 1,191 points, the largest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All the other three indexes ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the greatest drop on March 16.
Many consider it a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the state and central banks' time-consuming emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist points, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Regional Flybe airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and raft ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a great travel station associated with the Chinese New Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Year Lunar events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
On 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was globally affected, with reductions in shop hours or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
The resellers of North America and the Middle East observed a fall of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic at shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping Centers worldwide have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to verify the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were left home in provinces inside or in jail in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government help.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Indian border left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily pay) unemployed. A research by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families had gone through some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time work pay programme was adopted by France and Britain.
The performatic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the security of their employees and the public and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-acceleration impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, large sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home rather than participate in Masses on Sundays; some churches provided church services by radio, live streaming online or television while others offer cults like drive-in.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter’s square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered in the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming sites around the world were closed and face poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many large theaters like Broadway have also cancelled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live broadcast shows or creating "festivals" online for artists to present themselves, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet about the coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism aimed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people to deserve the virus or to be receiving a just punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in the areas affected by the virus.
After the progress of the outbreak in new focus countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe experiencing a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Trending Topics on Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was critical for referring to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and evacuated foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, bordering China, and students in large cities in India allegedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcuttá, who called it "mistakes". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and "discharge targets".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have provided scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibodies (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibodies tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal rubach or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal rubbing is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the material of the samples can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or expiring material (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It seeks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency approval of the Administration of National Medical Products from China for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real-time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests as a function of failure reagents, and a barrier to testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 tests available nationally from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction was announced; sampling and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,108 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test using isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternate cycles of temperature, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronovirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of delivering results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax radiographs have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coincidering with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after symptoms arise, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
Automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in question of hours and therefore much faster than conventional RNA tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the kits of acquired antibodies were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they should expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly afterwards. British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they are at the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea to perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, tests on drive-in have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, since only the positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020, a total of 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, collecting samples and carrying out additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: , or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity did not have an online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily income was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open-source models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need of robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, insufficient reagent shortages or quantities became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the USA.
This led some authors to study sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for additional tests. On March 31, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates are now conducting more per capita testing in its population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on the way to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass processing laboratory of population scale Group 42 and BGI (inspired by their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to function outside China.
Different testing methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German method for the manufacture of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have recourse to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests available for the USA and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak, in addition, those countries with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing performed by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the government of South Korea.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to delay the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with precision in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "mistakes"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results imprecise.
The company explained that the incorrect results could result from a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish minister said that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's purchased test kits had a "high error rate" and would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom the positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive monitoring of contact, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to seriously advise the inhabitants to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened within the planned holiday on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with none or little symptom.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % Tests" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people hospitalized in hospitals will have a greater % of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or cleaning hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's bum or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, frank or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be hygienic with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
Once you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, rations or discards of animals.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main goal of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in births made at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simple introduction of behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand-washing can reduce diarrhea episodes in about one third, which is comparable to providing clean water to poor areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes may be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior in houses, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main cause of IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the life of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, transforming handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in a entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and death of acute respiratory infections in a room.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Washing the hands also protects against the impiety that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of washing hands is that frequent washing of hands can cause skin damage as a result of skin resicing.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand-washing can cause a condition of disaggregation and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent handwashing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (mission, defecation), after cleaning the bum of a child (throwing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Other situations where the correct technique for handwashing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or wheezing the nose; after touching animal discards or dealing with animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States near the average of 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent. Various methods for changing behavior currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods. Collective handwashing for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to induce hand-washing in children's habits.
The "Esential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
The deparasitation twice a year, complemented by the washing of hands daily with soap, the brushing of teeth daily with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and to increase solubility.
The water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
The cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated-bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC repeats "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the conscious public in terms of health.
Until now, there is no indication that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, benzoic acid active antimicrobial acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps targeted to the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oility that holds dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygienizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygienic agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous base hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand hygiene) are starting to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickener agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or umectant, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol resicing.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hygienizers of hands containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logarithms reduction, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logarithm reduction) of bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygienizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygienizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for alcohol-based or hygienics can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The backs and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The tip of the fingers should also be well washed, being rubbed with the two palms. The Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends the washing of hands with hand hygienizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the proper washing of hands unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygienizers may cause skin resicing unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of resicing of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand-based hygienizers containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and resicing in the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hand-based alcohol-based hygienizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis has become an attractive one compared to washing hands with water and soap.
In spite of its effectiveness, non-aqueous agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygienizers are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in their hands.
The efficacy of hand sanitizers without alcohol is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based hygienizers.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have shown continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, different from alcohol, which has revealed reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Ash or land may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if land or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease can increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the US Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended that running water as fixed washing machines may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Rinse your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Swallow for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Swallow well with running water.
Washing on a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dried with a dry towel or allowed to dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, finger and finger areas.
Artificials and lacquered enamels can house microorganisms.
The hydrating lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin may cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cua with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "fastbacks" and other low cost options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging jar by a rope, and a lever powered by the feet to clear a small amount of water in the hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the process of hand hygiene, but there is a discussion about the most effective way for drying in public bathrooms.
An increasing volume of research suggests that towel papers are much more hygienic than the electric dryers of hands found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the towel paper, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Dryers with air jet caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and units potentially polluting other bathroom users and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Towel papers did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Productkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and the hand dryers were compared to drying with towel paper.
Washing hands with undecided hand-cleaning hand sheets is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygiene should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The clinical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous quantities of soap and water or gel to savour and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door, if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of hands by these surfaces.
The aim of washing hands in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate hand-washing and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of catheter-related infections in the bloodstream by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand-washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medicinal soaps or antimicrobials) confers an extermination action to a hand washing agent.
Such extermining action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not slide into the hands.
After the washing of the hands is finished, the hands are rinsed with a sterilized towel and the surgical rod is dressed.
To reduce germ propagation, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic to your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of cleaning hands in the first 20% washing, and an unsignificant additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hand hygienizer of alcohol-based hands reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygienizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium spores difficult in the hands. Interventions to increase the hygiene of hands in hospital environments may involve the awareness of the team on hand washing, increased availability of hand hygienizers based on alcohol and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more efficient in different health institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool to achieve good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for washing hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge to the achievement of universal practice of washing hands.
For example, in most rural Africa the faucets for washing hands close to any public or private bathrooms are rare, even if there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low rates of handwashing may instead be the result of entrenched habits rather than the lack of soap and water.
The incentive and defense of washing hands with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of washing hands and lead to a change in long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "three-star approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the three maximum stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns for hand-washing carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The world's hand-washing day is another example of awareness campaign trying to achieve a change in habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF released the adoption of an emoji for hand-washing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of handwashing in developing countries in relation to DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who had just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to encourage more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 outbreak of swine influenza and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to an increase in awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "appropriate hand-washing techniques" were hung close to wash basins in public bathrooms and in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring the reluctance to assume responsibility or to be connected to something.
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also verified that people, after recalling or witnessing anti-ethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually give more importance to hand-washing equipment.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after such vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleanness", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including faith Bahá'í, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity, and ablution in Islamism. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow the washing of hands before and after meals.
Workplace Hazard Controls for VOCID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazard controls for the prevention of COVID 2019 disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), functions with lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues, for which basic measures of prevention of infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct contact with persons not known to be contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but may be infected due to the current Community transmission or having travelled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, working environments of high population density, and in the retail market of large volumes.
The hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health and necroteria system who are exposed to persons with confirmed or suspected VOCID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in persons with confirmed VOCID-19 or suspected aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic may have various effects at work.
Workers may leave work because they become ill, because they have to take care of other people or because of fear of a possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing these products (such as shopping outside peak hours or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for the action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at higher risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by efficacy.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally the personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without the worker's behavior, and can be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE shall be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted as necessary (e.g. breathers), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or discarded properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety of Labour (OSHA), works with low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other work colleagues.
Basic measures for the prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand-washing, encouragement for workers to stay at home if they are sick and use the respiratory label, including sneezing and coughing, preparation of linen containers and for common garbage, preparation for telework or for stagnant shifts, if necessary, disincentive of the use of tools and equipment from other workers, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people at work.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relieve other symptoms, and also recommends that disease-free policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick member of the family, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission at the company's location, or because the individual has a recent history of travelling abroad, in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail shops. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, installation of physical barriers, such as clear plastic toilet forearms and installation of a fast-current COVID-19 drive window. Administrative controls for this group and groups of higher-risk include incentives for workers to stay at home, replacement of visible meetings by virtual communication, setting of staging shifts, cancellation of non-essential trips for places with a COVID-19 epidemic, development of communication plans, including a forum to answer the concerns of workers, provision of training and updated training on risk factors and COVID-19 protection practices, training of workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment, with instruction of communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, provision of training and training on risk and COVID-19 protection practices.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the sick person from the other persons by a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer her a facial mask, or ask the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The crew shall use disposable medical gloves when serving a patient passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include the postponement of the journey by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical center on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is that there is medical follow-up in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleansing and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a lanchonet, increasing the space between tables, arrival times and more rigid departure, limitation of non-essential visitors and use of a separate health care location for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged dispensations of the school can be considered. For law enforcement authorities who perform daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers contact individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guides as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common spray or cloth of household cleaning and follow the standard operating procedures for the containment and disposition of PPE used and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and necroteria workers to be in high-risk or very high exposure categories.
Functions with high risk of exposure include workers in the delivery of medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transportation, which are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected VOCID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchioscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Work in high exposure necrotries includes workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes too high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some necroteria scenarios and in the health area.
specimens should be handled with caution of level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated into two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends breathers for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-COV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particle filtration, approved by NIOSH or superior quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening officials at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If a process of aerosol generation is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall provision of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimization of the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a comfortable room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the necessary PPE for the specific task, continuous use of the same breather without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain and disstimulating the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards the other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
Companionism and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege to work.
I am extremely grateful and proud to have you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
That person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, because you keep your workplaces active, pay our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and times
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C team met last night to discuss our approach and times for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to what we are experiencing and the best way to maintain the sustainable organization in that period.
We want to end the stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to go away for a while, it doesn't matter.
For all employees, service providers and employees by contract:
our daily work expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work on normal hours, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy food or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
It is not necessary to certify or pay off. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and times to ensure that the key areas of the work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives proper management attention).
The staff who work per hour will receive the full payment.
We have said that before, and we are committing ourselves to honor our commitment to our contractors and employees who work hourlyly.
All will receive their wages based on their normal work file under normal circumstances.
Wages depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress because of the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate to your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to carry on.
Sites, HR, Trust and Security and Funding Engineering Teams (among others) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Decelling now will not harm us in the future.
We do not intend to "work doubled to regain lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we want to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide a longer time for the budget, and that employees prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The length of the schedule greatly reduces the workloads of current planning and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and office cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employ an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance bag and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own care duties protocol using products that are safe for its visitors.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in Washington is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to the COVID-19 with us and with all Washington officials.
Last week, our office in Washington moved to a totally remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the rental of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of meetings for not more than one or two hours.
If longer-term sessions are necessary, consider dividing them in several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and send in advance reading materials.
Use the videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors questions in chat and list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remote channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is looking for ergonomics guides in the webinar context to help increase the remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be sad with paralysis, but also of relief with clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help out with what's needed.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this e-mail and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with officials living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you might need help with, do not stop notifying and working with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, an acknowledgement that at this time our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we do not adapt to in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing to our movement the support they need and providing the world with the service that it depends on.
Our planned work will be our wait when the time comes.
For the time being, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably next months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the external surface (cell membranes) of the lung cells, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug directed at the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also works as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin type 2 is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
ECA2 protein contains a peptide domain M2 N-terminal and a C-terminal domain transporter of amino acids and collectin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage type 1 membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of the cells in the lungs and in other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is divided from the domain of the transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of major pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of the mRNA of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, streaked body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
ECA uses type I angiotensin hormone in type II angiotensin, causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn uses phenylalanine of carboxeterminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also requires several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradycin, apple, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in the Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point in some cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spike protein of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme in endosomers located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy, which led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells, perhaps helps in combating infection.
However, a number of professional societies and regulators recommended continuing the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with CVA and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II in circulation is elevated. Infused rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people ("contacts") that may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographical location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be transferred to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the TraceTogether application of Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a series of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential absence of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of fake or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Anistia International and more than 100 other organizations issued a communiqué calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected and presented as evidence-based protection;
digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of specialists in public health and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporting ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating device systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw localisation data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based non-system was used to execute contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including data tracking mobile devices and card transactions data, combining them to generate text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made the location information publicly available, which is permitted due to the comprehensive changes to the confidentiality laws of information after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy system and the centralized one.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
The contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to, at least, 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked in solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the proximity of one user to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, the identifiable personal data never comes out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of location data or route crossings to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Applicatives play dirty: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, an initiative that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with overlap of protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the overall interoperability of warning and tracking applications, a key aspect of the conquest of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government app, became open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for upgrades of operating systems, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Repositioning drug (also known as drug reproposal, reperfilation, reassignment or therapeutic replacement) is the reproposal of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple connection points.
Analyzing these linkage points provides a reasonable project for the development of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribofase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study conception.
Chloroquina is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York Andrew Cômo announced that the tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized by EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2" are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option."
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU's Langone Medicine School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to get the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that connects to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to replicate drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and infections by the Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against wire, pneum, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can lead to more severe transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a genetic barrier high to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by University Hospitals in Cleveland, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclsonide), of the company Teijin, which is an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is ongoing with 200 patients, to be recruited among severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers at the Institute of the Heart, in Canada, are investigating the function of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild COVID symptoms-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms that did not need to be hospitalized.
They were not included in pregnant women's tests, who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods.
Several anticoagulants are under test in Italy.
Heparin, with low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study with 300 patients is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, Italy.
Because SARS-COV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in the sense of giving new purpose to approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receiver): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
Vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the completed clinical tests, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a disease-causing virus, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 platforms of diverse technologies being researched and developing during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the initial stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety test and immunogenicity. It is typically randomised, placebo-controlled and multicenterly, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in avoiding the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active developing vaccine (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet had an evaluation in humans (continued in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular cluster, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the Centre for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announces the beginning of the work in a vaccine, with the objective of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner in Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine with similar technology used for neoantigenous vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "in the next 90 days."

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Research and Medical Development Command at Fort Detrick and Army Research Institute Walter Reed in Silver Spring, both in the western Maryland region, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emerging Bioslutions announced that it joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the preclinical test and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, would take at least one and a half and two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research at the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian declared that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "big sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop together a mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a currently preclinical mRNA-based candidate vaccine with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could start for human tests in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparation for Epidemic (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in developing vaccine for COVID-19 to 29 million dollars.
The other ECI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists began testing animals of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying vaccine from RNA to COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the receipt of the sequencing from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of the Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, declaring that "MNA delivered S1 sub-unit vaccines from SARS-CoV-2 which generated potent responses of specific antibodies to antigens [the mouse] that were evident that started 2 weeks after immunisation."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with the cloud computing of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A randomized posterior test in Australia is seeking to register 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of specific animals for COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for containment measures for level 3 biosafety to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in specimens of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-COV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three other in progress, all of which are virus-vetorized vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is an infectious disease caused by severe acute Coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by cough, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall on the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six regions of WHO.
Virus-infected patients may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing symptoms.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, face or blue lips.
Less common symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sliding nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function these asymptomatics perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking high releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of people contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it may be transmitted through faeces, if it believes the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to transmit before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easy the disease is spread, usually one or two people are infected. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if they are used correctly. Soap products degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivate it, as well as eliminate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the beginning of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-COV-2 is intimately connected to the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to VOCID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrations containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that the pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of secretory inflammatory monocytes of IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in necropsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the chain reaction of polymerase via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample may be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours of two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this purpose it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish their genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop independently polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, tests by means of antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person was infected in the past) were developing, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The FDA of the United States approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar foscal glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (septas lobular thick with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuria, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tossing or sneezing cloth, as well as covering the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the cloth is not available.
Adequate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, partly to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include that people are at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "purchase of the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after sucking their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol based antiseptics for hands with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is done by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for asepsis of hands".
Glycerol is added as humidifying.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (BCE) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive doctors and pneumologists of the U.S.A. gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being carried out that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) as well as taking the standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, breather or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but FDA has authorized masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (US).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of VOCID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
If any of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the aerosol particles to spread, if compared to high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in elderly people (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have adequate per capita hospital beds, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with sudden escalation in the number of severe cases of ICDOC-19 to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the COVID-19 hospital were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans with pressure control mode and high level PEEP are necessary to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High level PEEP may not be available on older fans.
The potential treatment research began in January 2020 and clinical trials are being conducted with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are under advanced testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorisation for the use of plasma of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The app can detect the "neighbor count" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses of cell data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people with whom they had contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile telephony data from people who are supposedly with coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect those who fail quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hack on the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of COVID-19 data. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized in hospitals with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological exams of samples post lung death show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopactic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung imaging looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from March of the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Comorbidity mortality estimates vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases may make the mortality rate overestimate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised regarding long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong verified a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections gave effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported in which recovery of the ICDOC-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, by means of transhipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of the onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the oldest date of the onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and with time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths resulting from SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 to deaths due to COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the mortality rate by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was propagated by carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had died by confirmed COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the 50-year-old range, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of women smokers and the development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking COVID-19 infection data related to sex.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different kinds.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCOV" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasopharyngeal zaragots and parts of respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the next.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories emerged, wrong information and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine was approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and researchers of the industry.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-COV is being used because both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, this research concentrates on the spicula protein that helps the virus enter the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ( DNA vaccines or RNA, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibodies-dependent enhancement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists of the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical tests in stage III of remdesivir in several countries due to a report from the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of applicants for medicine and vaccine for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of rendesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remedesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being performed in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although it recommends a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to the criterion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be more studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have demonstrated that the protein of the initial spiccula in preparation for serum transmembranar protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine antitemperstat properties. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
A non-randomised test is under way at the national level 2 in Italy, after having demonstrated positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected that neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of cytokine-refractory-induced steroid-induced cytokine release syndrome, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vacinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, use monoclonal antibodies are being developed.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disorders, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
