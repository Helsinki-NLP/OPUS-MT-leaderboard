The remaining UKIPs who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use specific arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to get tails behind those intolerants of chronic hypochondria who think they're all due.
I think you're the one who's using very specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing belts, does not exist practically.
I believe that is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by the UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch is not evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just made him comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a particular argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence was very surprised, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to be able to get back to it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his zealous Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of god and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is worse in Ireland than in Spain.
With the new crisis coming in the austerity period, nothing will be done.
To experience almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the ''EUROPE TIGRE'' was boasting us a few years ago.
We met later!
This starts reading the article again.
It is attempted to make Ireland appear to be a virtuous country and an ''ECONOMIC MIRACLE NEW'' is occurring.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible work market, a continuous emigration.
With these ingredients not what to '' pavoise'' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twenty-first century, Illance was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the Portuguese.In considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long, quiet river, it is in the light of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If we believe that a report came out in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily caps since the return.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be burning soon.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
I said I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once resilient.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers an extra fee for the additional fear they were willing to provide?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy about it.
Any item on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have to take themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will have to compensate the passengers and, if that is the case, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they were not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and it crawls literally from the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the magazine exhibition in the White Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are opened on Sunday, world-bourred with 50% tourists .
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is damaged by the fact that they buy in a detachment.
Tourism areas lose a considerable turnover each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows prices to fall.
Sunday rest is a right which, except for exceptions, employees enjoy.
That is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has any powers to reform the Labour Code.
While they lock it up.
What's the law for?
Satisfied part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And it's also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are terrible.
Surely his succession would want his share of the cake, if you give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Me neither.
But for 5 years, and for only five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He led the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to its magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and none else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect money from inheritance expenses, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they will gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
Renewal of the internal market by public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure sites by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real French evil: their distrust of dialogue
Return to prince values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he makes or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives incomes from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate the investor for a return at the time of his retirement and the person who lives on his incomes.
One property to rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
The small genius of Finance is uniquely lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, that is not the case.
The developed countries are equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline arises in response to a recession which is only a savage decline therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is overwhelming: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc....
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them options, functionality and price press.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a booming portable industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what we all care about.
I am glad that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that it is not an Apple product, even though I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, quite on Parisian fools) might tell us which author they fight ideas about the genre and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the kind described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone who's smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the neighborhood of Furusato referring to Holoferne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have his vivid mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you are returning, this subject doesn't interest me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: acknowledge that culturally, send Judith back to Holoferne, so do.
Who's afraid of asking the World?
But what are we afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first invoking Judith from the Bible, the second in calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how intimate these studies are at home.
We are obviously no longer in the discussion of the idea.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean,that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to a discussion of the idea, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the sole presentation of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) doesn't seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not on the other hand that he understands the nuance.
I have not read Judith, the very symbolic slicer of throat, I am content with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to the wishes of Lo.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up a bit of the disappointment that sometimes the view was blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really be the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessing, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the entire week of the rain of Persian meteors and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends (forcefully) by disappearing?
You seem to spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Superb picture of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
Looks like Mars is going into collision with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on the inequalities between incomes from work and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Let's see today Tuesday, October 15th, the results of the miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece, the scholarship collapses.
Yet it seems that the examples to follow are to be followed.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of the Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of the Economy is wrong?
Will decision makers who have reached the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is damaged by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, they contribute to the financing of material and intangible investment in the growth of tomorrow and hence future revenue.
A few elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your ghost.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Because Liberians want our health system to look like the U.S., you should learn how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of businesses and "research".
Therefore, read the few reports on our spending on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another about what is for free sale or only on prescription.
This reinforces it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that stop them and the expensive permit.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy about using alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you ma'am but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put a flea in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't stop patenting on grass...
If social scientists were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One investigator investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not searching.
To compare is to make the pedagogy not of research.
You can't say "search is done you have to apply it" and then in the same jet "you have to experiment at all".
If your research is done why experiment?
If your research isn't done, why do you ask us to apply?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow us to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what you're getting, a will for self promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to move sophists and ideologues away from training, and practitioners teach practitioners.
Reread the paragraph on the internships (which is not very argumentative) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of the practices in force, and does not allow the system to move forward."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish only practitioners to teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would permanently destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fair: if I didn't want to be operated by a practicer who only has a theoretical training, I'd like even less to be operated by a surgeon who doesn't have any theoretical training and learnt about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright violations by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright, it will suffice me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright = theft.
That's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not at all.
By using content without the appropriate license, you deprive the artists of their breadwinner.
You can still discuss pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become as true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If I ever start feeling guilty of violating copyright
You don't seem to mind depriving the artists of their incomes.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have clicked.
Maybe if they share their mp3 walker's listeners with a partner on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Well, if we could export this resource to which we're waving, the radiator who says it's all wrong....
If it is a PS Member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France pulls people down by assisting them continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What throws France down is the speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the invalid patterns I often meet.
At ease in my basketballs I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, when compared to German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have structured their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What are French employers waiting to do the same?
That the state hold their hands?
This state they accuse of imperialism?
@ Jacques L.
Always this couple against business leaders on your part!
Remember me, that you created as a job, as an added value, to be as severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who budge and undermine while waiting for the state's permanent assistant!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to claim the drop in wages or not their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic because of the way people always complain about the First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep up rather than change.
It doesn't mean that Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated it to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all help themselves across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
Maybe it's because the management of the Dutch is on good rails while the management of the British isn't.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least wrong choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening to it, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaters", who are no less dead, I know of it palanates.
Being out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start over, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDE.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When you look at the examples of your life, there's only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, it would be just a moment, that we may have a merit to get out of a disease or that we can demerit from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I am afraid to think otherwise, if, having a strong morale, it may be easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is primarily someone who trusts medicine..
But if we'd rather give it back to the "Lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to the moralists.
When you catch a piece of dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two of them, some dirt, some big ones, and if I "baked" like these psychological ends, it totally escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to tighten your teeth, to suffer the hell and cash the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalised about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist has become a nationalist who has waged three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under MOINDRE Rule of International Law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he were to defend him, he'd be swallowed up by the West Compressor Roller.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by Western States that then ultimately lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for not having understood the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as Tyran (even if we do not love him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes walking around in Greece, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thanks for having us share the results.
A hope therefore but the caution is to put this water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years away from the Earth in the Cygnus constellation which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Franine of the University of Maryland team.
Method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat to arrive.
Thank you, science passer to give us, often, these experimental feats that are realized in the world.
How do the animals know (advance)?
Probably through the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of earthquakes.
Like radon, for example.
A gas is a priori unodorous for humans but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the instruments of measurement available to him.
But we don't have reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals have acted strangely a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report relating to the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to make the validity of their work that dealt with the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular to their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we looking at these researches?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious magazine, and no one disregards it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter each other in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I do not understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as the mayor of London.
When listening to the LBC program you can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing about it and he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not keep one.
It just points out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
It was in Have I Got News for You.
Because it is a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and he will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will crack the ceiling I'm sure of it.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we said about the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the blinker, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French really and always ignored the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have found it hard to read a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent by B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "ferral Strait" speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the Battle of Savo) did not want to go back there.
We actually passed before the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even though the mission is at its end.
That's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozene to achieve the objective completely discredits the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors Just philanthropists.
A coma operation more neither does nor does it.
The cow, it's too much fun!!!
I look forward to the webseries!
Your recital makes me reverse, identifying me a little at the crossing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the White Moulin in front of Brest!).
Hats also for the ecological message, even though some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to turn us upside down, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some even friendly adventurers as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was middle-field or before in the 1970s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where it is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the supervision of the legendary Suleman Rebac, has completed twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also included pointers such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you very much.
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his seat when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as much as I know he didn't own it.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighboring.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and childless children are inside?
How???
What I am somewhat intrigued by in this "witness" is that the only fact that I have been able to, would be once, spontaneously rejoice at the terrible death of thousands of people, is in my view of a personality "buying line" whose all the "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Surely, at the short time of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalypticly harm the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
Making qqch powerful.
Great.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims torn by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We were wondering about that.
The West "Christian/White/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendour, certainly magnificent is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil son of a bitch?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigated the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the gel of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understood before, we must not put the Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help for mood and well-being.
The fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the blow in the fall.
Not as much as the wind as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, the summer falls a weekend.
We've had a good summer this year, don't make your cliché that slows down the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of intriguing smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, risks of anxiety and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
These are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child increments , it is the amount charged by the State that comes primarily from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with respect to the number of households that have seen their tax increase following this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the share of widows in particular is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is entirely under assessment: 230M of euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and, of course, it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on straw, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue and you'll encourage those 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Live the Trots and OCIs recycled at the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses its full use.
And once the money's worth is exceeded, the money only serves to make money, that is to say to make the most of it.
We're among the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% homes that work the most (and create wealth that a part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of part of their efforts.
Or so much to lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of the head cutters at the red Khmer lived happily.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any concern.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, store behind yourself and go home.
In the future this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you'll need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No that's not true.
You're just really out of luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transfer $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm planning to pay a deposit and a month to rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,000 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," sang the Bu$herie on all tones...
Inoffensive weapons.
I am sure that this will please families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not too clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it everyone's time to strengthen education, because we're still at war?
Education would already be much strengthened if "they" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are currently gaining more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this cannot be seen as the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers, so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, unless the employer pays neither the computer nor the internet connection nor supplies.
In fact, it's so much the plan at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't complete the math CAPES, come, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to get caught up in some bad education that the parents are spitting on you by treating you as a handkerchief?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurd population can thrive.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely gone all the way through.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to win three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a degree was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a London subway worker, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we weren't even asking for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't do it if you don't find a registered job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do it.
If I had stayed at the graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan
I do not like business so much, so I hope eventually to spend either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bisunor channels such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is to say what is called the qualifications of the unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I've finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree, but, as the above article says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting wage was lower, but the steps are quickly raised because in the real world, what counts is more results than knowledge.
This debate of engineering / arts has lasted for years.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work at the moment, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are biased?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about the kind of media study degrees or whatever the absconse line you've gone to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high schoolchildren, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I can hardly see the inhabitants of the end-end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km go back and forth every day on bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belts already have many other more practical common means of transport (métro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key closed parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
To the extent that they benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for ONE Bike Hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other transport users in common the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and fuck the survival of bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the cycle tracks are going flat, we have to reduce the traffic of cars (urban road type congestion load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), make the traffic code meet by systematically verbalizing (even the bemmol bikes pres that you need to adapt the code of the written road for bathrooms 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the sealed passages, not before either bathrooms and scooters do not get generated.
The cyclable tracks are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Anything on the bike in the grand Paris?
Not a word on the bike's place in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of veiled movements is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition to what is reported by OR, EELV assistants seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, you'd better find who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: It's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world evolves.
That sounds horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
One lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the investigation report on the resulting criminal investigation and accident.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had previously been shot down, Ukraine launched air attacks against rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the light of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay for overflight rights in the territory?
Where are all pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurping government / Western Ukrainian ultra-nationalists - and want to show in bulk that Putin has shot down MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will allow this case to go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have said nothing of that.
Calling himself Ricardo and being such an eco-friendly benotian, it's distressing!
Calling himself Polar is losing the north is joyful.
One beotian question: is the poor today poorer than the poor yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently have not read it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production-income, capital-income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the term..
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of 20° before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has a few limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, it can be debated without reading the book, the main thing is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of his pave summarized by the press false?
I haven't read and read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis, and that's the one that seems to me to be pure fumistry.
The concept of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is not humanity globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my happy wishes in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years.
Is not Malala herself part of these "colored perverts"?
You shouldn't have any "antenna time" on this site.
You, yourself, are a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are schooled and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she receive higher education and that she has the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14 years of age, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't put it out loud enough for you.
It may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange, who obviously has a bit of difficulty finding her character as a sister of Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
It's a fascinating first episode.
The performance is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronistic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply reversing.
I haven't looked at this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden than to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risk of staging and mountings that sucked me.
In AHS, there is an avalanche of original plans that makes it very ridiculous to accept today's productions.
I'm a little out of sight to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to boost the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so, there are many more things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (especially her path and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series out of the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series is fishing in writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it'll end up like 24 hours what.
But everyone does what he wants!
That's why I'm saying "I won't look any longer" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - let's cut rather in the state's spending.
No, let's increase the expenses please.
Those who wanted to know the expenses failed.
Initiate controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their vows and during all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
The "debt" is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government spending one third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought he was going to use it well.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been completely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to almost useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you come up with a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax sound very ridiculous on the most luxurious homes.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35 000 per year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay about £10,000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car vineyard, and it's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I am paid decently, but not in an extravagant way.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from the sky, or it's not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door prove it?
While 20% of the unemployed would not be looking, that means 80% are looking and not finding.
Being unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
May a potential recruiter receive 10 or 20 CV, increase my chances of being so.
Actually, I haven't heard from Pôle Employment for months, which means that the agents are more busy in control operations than actually getting back job announcements?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough posts, then you must pass Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requires their transport title to users of a means of transport, a head of service or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in those cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had business at Pôle Emploi, my rights at the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
The fact-finding and control is taking over at present, while Pôle Emploi is legally close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern employees, they pay the costs.
Non-salaried French and politicians grant themselves rights that they have not indeed!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of paid labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, we need to have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of black fever in 1348/9 in relation to war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the mind to ban the Hadj at Mecca this year from the Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who hired the smallpox at Mecca during the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same mind.
Is it a heartless proposal to prevent Ebola patients from taking an airplane for Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" have decided that you could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
Nobody gets out.
Only health care personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after contact with people in West Africa even though they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be put in quarantine immediately.
May it happen to pass on the message of the first individual and of the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace.
I doubt that he is able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
He's still far from that design here.
It's only been 20 years since the information appeared as mankind's premium, while religion, from the brain, has been leading our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the interest in becoming a Protestant Church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet to the Church anyway, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, do we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogen"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision to France.
And in the world, it may be that it will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it pre-existing to the Christ.
Hillel a century before he already said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, that's the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces the agapa.
Your "progressing justice, peace, fraternity" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has overturned moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted from force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game comes out soon.
It's not making up.
I would personally choose Som.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If it is the PC version you are interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% reduction, or does the £30 include 20% reduction?
Note however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no rebates, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *Shut up *
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to use it against the people who buy it there while they're outside the planned region.
Join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was the 1940 France a "puried land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Do you have to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel for literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano is worth it, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello, the terrible people.
Since I've been driving one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or run me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medocs.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fanatics of CAMRA (not to be confused with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving on Sunday's return was really tough.
On Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather to play the nin card brag.
Thanks to a real chance as a beginner, I was able to leave with several decent poses.
I hope that if I get 95 years old, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of larvae on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits the quests for the djihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She quickly reports arms trafficking.
We either have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you go to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental counter-sensus: the totality of all authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslims or not, who have formally condemned the IE and its crimes, French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say no.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Marvel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly manifest themselves to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the Republic and can only contribute to the delinquency of French society.
If there is no doubt, as to say .
Who says no, but what?
Consent to a proximity with IE or IE conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to save the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that during the elections, Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely concerned about Scotland as there is no seat.
They can do what they want in full electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour lost seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will pour a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the " PROMESSE" thinking that he saved his party but did not realize that he signed the death arrest of his Scottish deputies.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking their leader for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's rather important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Setting the 8% pumps to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
Moreover, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband so.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it did him well.
Yet he is still in law to be Prime Minister in 2015 and this since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "The Life of Others" from East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, it will have at least one sterilising effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without moschard.
In view of the price I paid Kobo, it's without regrets.
I am proud of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public library, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding labour leaders whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example, James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake.
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same tray.
The anonymous data collection when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that does not permit the identification of readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic boys under acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot a bullet in its foot, unless you win something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually getting a bullet in her foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overturn Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals here or whether it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today's Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to details rather than c*naries balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read by keeping in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics pushes the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have a head.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should it be?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have any chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a well-paved place in Central Asia about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in a mother's womb.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilous straight couples too.
What about the kids!
What a shame to call them psychologically unbalanced futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and placed in the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're done like this...
The important thing in the matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they as much as body merchanting?!
Anatronic Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good country grow away from home via the internet and PayPal Pal than to numb its responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near to home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are not just Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
There is no question that the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go in the night!
But if you like this and you listen to music - this music is still touching you.
I don't know why there are so many disgusting comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of stories that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
It is nothing surprising that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can have an ear if you're in the London region in November: 99psoul will again go out of sol vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought "always the same story," but here's a little well-written and well thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and to Wallgate.
Drowning pills.
Whatever the train station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly poisonous.
The Palestinians have no peace partner.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in addition, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative rose in anger and cried out: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) rose and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the custody ...
That it displeases the anti-Israeli is a clear fact, it is not the goal sought ...
Antisionist: But I have answered you, I have translated: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been so since the politics is globalized...
No, no, no, no, no.
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it endures!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of strength has allowed Israel to be created?
Antisionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a strong relationship!
Do you doubt ?!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says is that there are no other written pseudo-chomskyes.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old girl loves her well, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious burden, with just a suspicion of consciousness that Russell Brand says certain truths, maybe truths we don't prefer to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting was completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that he just tells people not to vote and instead to cross the arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos he has posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (at slightly different degrees) govern mainly in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and the rich, At no time he says simply to ignore the policy completely because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more active politically at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, and try to influence politics from this.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are little politicians who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is reluctant to see all these condescending responses that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people discussed what it really says rather than simply labeling it as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about voting has been completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot in a ballot box every five years makes me deeply upset that my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and local Members who are accountable to their constituents.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-establishment students from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to bring together under the label " pseudo-chomskyist blizzards".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even head cracks added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
He draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fraud" above all reveals to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDV of history where trade historians have become minorities and where exchanges of specialists have been deprived of the benefit of ready-to-think condensed science Po for press records.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a guilty, an emissary goat.
They develop one and the other very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these emissary loops that are the key to vost of their thought.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This stems from a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the relationship is solved by removing it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or / libertarian slope ( of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go looking for the state's relief for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not of state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals here.
No support from any other side.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of its god of then, Stalin, the small father of the peoples.
Oula, you probably read a chauya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer enjoy attacking Michel through...
Gauchet is deeply thinking about the contemporary individual and the collective, the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by hard left-wing human scientists who do not support the passing of allegiance to their mantras, is quite resilient.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is boundless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebells", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellows" that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about it, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese guy last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so from the whites!
My family lived in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them have violently anti-White words.
My father is not happy that his older daughter gets out with a white woman.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and through this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians are mainly prejudiced against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or who are faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really strange that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two in my life (one of them abroad), I didn't keep any bad memories, all the people were brave and, in fact, those in London were very kind, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are brave, how they remember who they were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the said Blanc.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: pardon, but the judicial circles are frankly marked right.
When he was in the judiciary, he represented only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be taken based on the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders that two obstacles be removed.
That of the observer's political vision as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
There remains then the necessary tool of the law to refocus the assessment on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance with all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided among those three groups.
Pretentiousness and ignorance do not fall under objective analysis.
What if all of this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from a very low level.
The previous preambular allows the following to be well entered in the third ratio.
The one from corruption* from the judiciary.
Subsequent subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The field in question is that of depoliation* of heirs committed up to fraud at the proceedings* by successive genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains €150 million a year and benefits from the coverage * provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this brings the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in the course of many disputes between genealogists and heirs who are reluctant to get themselves further, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws in favor of heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Probably prohibitive prices.
There is still material to be used to get rid of the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of those ground-worked tricycles, built to measure its size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the open air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, couldn't.
Like we say, tastes and colors...
Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair in EPIC air.
I think the Whill inventor never had to clean a dog's crumb on a dog.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the ground, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually look high, but there really are people who put that kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle all land seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have reasonable assurances at their disposal.
Only if they become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know very well that we need them.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not intended to make it.
I'm aware that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive that shit.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people who are under 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockades!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects turn a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the tongue of wood, rather in concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market is certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
The unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The US has a well-maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after getting up, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm an Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israel-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live in an underground fortress, built against the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, without profit.
Many are only looking for one night's catch on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all of this.
"What does it put on for rent"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, if you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers the authorization to engage in a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and caught, flown, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to catch him?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to end!
The high finance, speculative, plays with our companies our jobs, our raw materials, our purchases, our food, our health care structures, and our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesses of the money.
Until proof of the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it's finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the minister of the economy a former bank of Rothschild, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else as a competitor?
You call it how to get his jacket back, lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know much about what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee has really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the enemy's exact strength.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British currasse in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the pictures showing survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that's not really what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two curated cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after having stopped the shooting, and a race-by-step began.
The Leipzig lives something on fire, but as he comes closer he sees it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, leaned and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing out his projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 2215 hours.
Concerned about reports of a British currasse in the surrounding areas, he headed north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, trying in the darkness before the invention of the radar, didn't know that a ship had flown, so they couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cuirassé of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they emerged to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should walk through many Royal Navy ships.
The sacrifice of cradock had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are cast at the PMA to request that a finally convicted elected person be included in the law as a result of this definitely ineligible fact.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing electors well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED AN INCRIPTION TO THE SURVEY OF MAGISTRATS COUNCILS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Interviewed by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always ready to approve those themselves who will take advantage of their unmovability to hinder the actions of true policies, which are really trying to move things, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is to the extent of their sufficient.
I met them in the subway towards noon with their small signs" from the subs for justice" they came from the province and did not make a difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing, or extreme-right trade unions, targeted individuals on its board and fought against them a legal-media war.
Your statements are totally free of charge.
If, at present, the right is defraying the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of its attention have not been treated in favour.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the judicial union on the left is not the only judicial union and is a minority.
A minister's strong support for trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite is perhaps minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it is not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is not more out of place than to instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, MS is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Wasisel.
I believe that even the most hungry of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a stepping stone to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is, in fact, a member of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all of them participated in the Eurovision competition, as well as many others.
While others such as Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens to most stars who don't participate in the competitions anyway.
Rare are those who, after one tube, manage to do others.
However, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and one best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock walk, even though in your dreams you think that all the guitar-moaners who smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – distance that turns fast enough to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present these distant peoples as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual jewellery, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations in everyday life.
Unless you interpret recklessly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that drums are devoid of sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Mariannes and Molières are not also somewhat sacred?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined and circumscribed object in the religious sphere.
Article very interesting whatever it is.
It's the ephemeral deco to furnish the vacuum.
There's nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of Illustrated Figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the horties of interpretations not of all scientists that last a mandarin's life, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of disciplines to make us laugh a little bit?
Because what is relevant to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is through them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method was not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could have been mistaken.
Today we have so powerful technical and scientific means that the intercepting of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
There we are there in the middle (and old) polemic on shamanism advanced by the prehistoricist Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Les shamanes de la prehisto", especially the increased re-editation of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the creek?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could expect to have that kind of comment on your part.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
It's more than just making a deal with these puerile ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away then.
If these puerile ass jokes shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is that the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Yet we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case that of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., pickup) was entering the circuit.
But it had to be done quickly before the typhoon that we knew he was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it right to advance the departure time (tele, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the rest to beat the English that was then leading to...
You're leaving on this blog, dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to unload all your shit.
No, just don't.
There were lots of conspiracys in F1, but never one that put commissioners at risk of death for a distant story of one pilot's chance of winning at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image mainly allows the AIF to avoid embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner acts a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed to be too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners is clearly acting as a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a grim lack of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag ARRES the place of the accident, from which the green flag stirred.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of commissioners just downstream of the accident (as the case may be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal light.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid, ultimately, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep making people afraid so they can continue to control them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear" It should be "dark", not "wrinkle".
Given the medical reference, “tossing” is much better said in this context than “to derail”.
I wonder if all the people who are struggling that Ebola could become airborne realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this pseudo-journalism abject.
That made me laugh.
I'm depressed that the media are talking about most of the things with this optimism on the other hand.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government to make us disappear when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to face a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any evidence?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
From the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies do not serve anything: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be the reason why patients in psychiatry are not asked questions when reliable observations are made from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) serves nothing in a scientific approach?
So, what do you base your research on?
About ghosts?
Do you place at the same level fantasist theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word "biton" used by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'Ammbourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik has struck us with "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will break us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to show up the Sentinels of the Air...
And why then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who rise to it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the all-powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the mood like pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a series for kids?
UKIP works for Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermaration?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (even though I am an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain of rediffuse the old.
The series has almost never stopped broadcasting here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since we have had one hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival the free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at those times.
And besides the half-hour episodes are now at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have not allowed anything to be found.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Can it be Argentine??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the plain of the mosques was built.
Its top, or dome of the Rocker, sails in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad was set up in paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there was no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and unfortunately they are relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in 2 states, and has dealt with it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much Jerusalem's annexation is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his people?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown by half-devested young Naïads on the beach.
Reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as you can see in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
Too bad that Reuters' photographer did not take photos of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to return to the Temple Mount and prefer to lay down the Jewish faithful on the ground, praying to the Wall of laments.
@Mat, if this picture bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be leaving behind, large businesses have benefited greatly from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given even greater pay to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of shaking and moaning when someone else strikes, sustain them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being poisoned with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it's been held.
Did you vote for PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TCI) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-State dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is what makes excellent profits, while the digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on the trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th, there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (at last, its officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe in the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the country's decline, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, briefly: the dissolution of the idea of the nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even though for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll sign up.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of the interests of the class, there is already quite enough the protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about a grievor's fear of risk.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If not, disaster is assured.
And with the ready carts, the government congratulates itself.
What security are you talking about?
Dishonest indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I referred to the military and other officials, since this is the subject quoted here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of information power.
And yet you have opened, likely read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Baker Off Review". ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (like a deceiver: it was wine) in the history of television.
So, the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has done such "bum, here's my fucking cake now buff it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept out of sight.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that goes away in the last week.
I like to cook, but I don't think I'm getting hurt by that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and makes us try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually put days to do them and they had to brigade one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to start, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base a little dry (even if I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not give away, however Richard had already lost at that time).
I must confess that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allocated.
There is also cancer that looks, with solar wind blows.
Decidingly, we're all making it right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to "hate" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they have an interest in allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to warm us (less than infrareds), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
Ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets the UVA and most UVB pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescendant and consider your interlocutor as a quitter when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was under-concerned in the commentary, which he himself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a regular melanoma, the UV only make its development ACCELAR.
They don't try.
For proof: not all bronzed persons necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a tubib tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary to any human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV causes melanoma directly.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
Or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied there and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
There's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We're making this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth joke on the fold I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can hardly see how it could go back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and is therefore associated with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and it's surprising that industrialists produce in » industrialists' We put super u forward but all the teachings and memes the small trade are concerned How to buff bon, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in French)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his or her priorities where he or she hears it.
For my part, the food is one.
Go without resentment, I'll kiss you.
It is called Bobos, or rather boboécolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect their realities.
It's the total degrouping thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in the truffle, joining in this the left-caviar, of which they have sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and truffle, nor are you surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Wauh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecols are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-left-caviar?
Well, you're in a position to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological shade.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the short-lived ecos.
The boboecolo is part of it, but it represents only the most visible fringe of the ecology, because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
She's so badly hurt that she's vaguely like a naked woman.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don't have any legitimacy to comment on since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing the billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for that, a camera will do the job.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to do with savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
The honesty requires that France decreases its strength, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drasticly, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, when we observe weaknesses, shortcomings in our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save, but especially not at home, it's really not possible at home...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the cage is certain.
That all those who have sided with the military dare to say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really cool: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you'll understand why Defence can feel a little charged!
Well, yes, the economies that everyone agrees to say we have to do them, it must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor dear ones.
I'd have to do it, but above all, it doesn't fall on me, because in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the story is repeated at every job closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't like savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most daring thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's the depression of having her thread parade on Facebook and seeing that 80% of her friends started their status with the phrase "This awkward moment."
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
He will probably rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus by going to work and realize only there that his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely silly.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who the rights will be?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
With no computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie really just showed that he's at the top of the cosmic universe that's satirical journalism!
I'm falling apart!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the lighting and discover the incredible lightning and insurpassable genius that floated from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective association initiatives.
Until further notice, we have confiscated the right to save our planet by states that are playing the tarts at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner that they planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translated: Winds and solar farms are tomorrow's Round Points.
All financed by the con-taxable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the line is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emission to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by wind renewables or PV is already more GHGs on the other stages and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate intermittentity.
The replacement of nuclear power by wind renewables or PVC would be against the control of CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am the State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say it was you who lent me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't answer to what I said and how all the people on the right demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to mention the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current renewable energy programme in Germany is an inefficient and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't count uranium extraction and construction and if you don't count the greenhouse water vapour of less effect than the Co2 it is true remember the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!!
Pakistan last won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most of the Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it really shows your mood.
That would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosis.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, the Athletico of Kolkata imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
In comparison with the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how can we ever compete with our "breathing neighbors"...
The low cost launch race is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the defect of possible design manifests only with a helium too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design defect, but implementation...
unlike arianspace that is a private company, it seems well that beouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They might be paying for the frigate satellites who know..
This is all the more difficult since many media are looping up the only articles titles - and many readers only retain these titles .
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project when it is just a launcher problem.
