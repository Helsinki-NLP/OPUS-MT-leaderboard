In Austria, it has 29 percent of the population.
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have led to a significant weakening of both parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered from particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the EU leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a three-fold return on the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the votes, has ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; in particular for the popular party, who triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance on SPÖ.
The electors, however, visibly chastised them for allowing the government to collapse.
From the first response to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary party management council.
Such a change would facilitate a priori the way towards the outcome of the election which remains most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two populist parties on the right - the free (FPÖ) would have achieved 18 percent and BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even generated sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to collaborate with any party and planned to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently on this development.
The last party to have access to the parliament being the Greens, but they slightly lost and returned, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in the fifth position.
Obviously, no other party passes the limit of four percent and does not access the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool off
If the problem of the Czech investigators accused of illegal cockroach was not resolved in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister told him today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Ms. Mukherjee said, speaking out, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, Darjeling's, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then ask for bail and wait for the judgment to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms, that his partner expresses himself in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be thanked," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to maintain with India the best relations, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great contempt," he said.
The Minister left the question as to whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he merely notes.
A Czech Arbitrator Fight for the Seabed
It approaches an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he was not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as big as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, director of the division, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The pain at work and enthusiasm characterize the atmosphere of reigning.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources may be found there, but also living organisms currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A Wider Background Than Land
The coastal states have now begun to aspire to new underwater territories with vehementness.
According to a UN convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the said exclusive economic one," Mikulka explains.
The country's request to the Commission for the setting up of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on several expensive perspectives and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Committee has been concerned with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which is the first to have greatly expanded its underwater possession, has recently experienced global retaliation.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission allocated to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the prospections.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they project it, invaluable.
In turn, other countries will progressively submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years after they have ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the oceanic bottom, proclaimed by convention "common patrimony of humanity".
There, no more State enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in that area is conferred by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let's not deceive ourselves, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka exaggerating, stating that "the areas are precisely defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former block of Eastern countries within the framework of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospective by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract there on an extent with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a rich deposit in polymetallic productions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian division employee, provides an example of such a realization.
It recalls a small apple of land, or, with a little imagination, the legendary shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were in place for the liberation of hostages
The Egyptian government had called for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never turned to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists taken from Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Station and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as technical logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk were at the place of release.
As the Departments spokesperson communicated it on Monday night, German forces were not finally required, hostages who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on-site as a support force.
"This has not fortunately happened so far," said a spokesperson of the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The attackers had taken the group of tourists from the south of Egypt consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their kidnapping in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained vague until now, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved are in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives denies the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress recently failed the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones grazed in the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan in favour of the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that had to jugulate the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called on Members to vote in favour even though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent to 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue plan could lead to.
It returned shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fall again.
Experts are now planning serious new turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reservations for the next few months according to a study, the turnover has significantly increased compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak cyclical prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfyable according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) was entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute's survey, increasing numbers of reservations already dominate in the fall months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to DRV.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the USA would be particularly sought, the DRV stated.
There, the increase in reservations would be about a Tiers.
Apart from this, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be especially sought after destinations by Germans.
Specially organized travel is very demanding, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for individual travel".
Consumers can save money among others with reductions in early reservations or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very low so that an increase in sales figures will be reregistered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or After-Ski continuously, from beer in pitches to litre and celebrities in tyrian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV entertainer and wears a custom-made tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is on occasion.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this to my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolian costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist at the beer festival and normally living north of the Equator of Weißwurst, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was up to now limited.
But once in Theresa, it's all half worse.
Each or almost wears a tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemed or embarrassed - it's completely normal.
Only a pair of weird eyebrows on my Tyrolian costume at the Bananas-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have wrongly attached my apron: "to the left means free, to the virgin, to the right, to the widow's rear."
Discreetly, I triple my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she says and laughs.
Others don't do so much harm for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which it is written "Too Drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us to their bare back train without being invited to it.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgious", with an extended "oooooo".
He told me all this after he relieved himself of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage dump.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pessors".
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol like that.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers scurried on the place of the party and had to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in riot - always by four, they drag their covered city with tents.
It works like this for most of the visitors of the beer party: we're going empty, we're back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the donkeys under the boat are not visible.
"These are the ones that can no longer swallow," one of the rescuers shouts in answer to my question and disappears in the mix.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday after noon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there afterwards.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey broadens its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter the country behind it.
On the east side of Bosphora, 20 steps away from Asia can be one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is set on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each of its angles, such as some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the land most known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions broke out during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turkish and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded and destroyed its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolicly, serves to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region around it, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suât Kinikilioglu, one of the experts in foreign politics.
The next morning, after a trip of 10 and a half hours, rocked on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new century state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and in particular Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically made of stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built malls and numerous pastries in which middle managers in men's and women's clothes meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikilioglu could have been a right-centre politician from any other party in Europe.
Wear, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut from its rear country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with both of us.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "it doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all of those with whom I was able to speak, they recited by heart: The Turkish railroad not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, therefore, is as much an advantage to Europe and the United States as to Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Director musical at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was to include at least 21 years old, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old- refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to him, whether he was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants"
It's all in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named knight, that's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1962 to 1982 periods when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them has ever disappointed me, and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
There will be a lot of us missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (died September 25th) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
That's what came from a letter from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and ended at the same time, a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda Super Sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
This adds to some refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and save more fuel.
A evolution in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be emphasized that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation's market.
First, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is true of Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about one million cars sold in six years, represents located in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The officials of the Spanish branch hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the exit of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to deal largely with the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, is a drop in sales of 16%.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer estimates, 50% of the sales of the Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Contents and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimeters in excess), its width is 1.69 metres (two centimeters in excess) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, height does not change to 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the chest - which has a double-bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation chest.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Hounda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that provide access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that would open with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 liter gasoline propellers.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 r/min and 114 nm torque at 4,900 r/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which over the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the bees' flight, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created his own personal space in an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles within a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forging its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Displacement Laboratory and Senior Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second the device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logics of prior manoeuvres, that is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about giga-bytes of memory, not even megabytes."
This represents the first cause of the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid to be hypothesized.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they have created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
It's 'the Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel leads us to think on several occasions if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but undetailed information.
It's more of a teen game.
What if the game is over?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital in MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entrance to his Mitsubishi table tour of UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomes by a sharp drop in its stock exchange course.
One week after revealing an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The price is below 19 per cent of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of 29 dollars, 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which must allow him to diversify his activities but to move under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday further show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, that participation would consist entirely of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover us."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they exchange more than 50% over the conversion price, or approximately 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will enable MUFG to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a group spokesperson refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should display a Tier One solver ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan specified that he had "quitely" lightened his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been proving for the group, which saw its Fellowship course melt by half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt flowed.
This cost was reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the fallouts of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa to Quito on Monday.
To consolidate the republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third that put a new draft Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls were conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large "yes" win, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed tremendously," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the seat of the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in peace according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution dedicates the power of the state to the economy, preserving it the "planning of development" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
The project, elected by Correa in 2006, also provides enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will be able to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa had already announced that it would use this power and challenge a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the Quito and Washington agreement for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the 11 tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back to Egypt's capital on Monday afternoon except for the rest of the day.
In the morning they were released by an Egyptian commander in Chad.
Apparently in formation, the hostages arrived about 15:30 a.m. on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations there.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the raptors," said on the tarmac the Egyptian minister of Tourism, Zoeir Garanna.
Captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was swept from one place to another by 35 unknown rappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the Special Forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and half of the raptors were killed, the others fled," said the manager who required anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Special Egyptian Forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commanders.
The head of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the raptors were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking place in this electoral campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the misery granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are hungry?
Which politician would urge the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the Constitution of their country, it is written in our American neighbours that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteer groups in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogy societies are concerned about searching history, preserving with three under the brinks of private archives, and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
To what time, a forum for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states come to help the Belgian-Holland Bank, as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, at an amount of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary.
On this weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, by also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission to compete.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been widening for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions to be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
There is no doubt that the bank will sell part of its shares, among which, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, it acquired last year of the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertigo fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to be let go bankrupt.
Just Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around €14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of beyond-Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US rescue plan of $700 billion, to be at the root of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, paper has already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial organization was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received any substantive proposals.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
There was no panic in the clientele circle of the bank and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the poultry
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that relate to the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is up to entrust its chicken to a fox" - Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and insured capital in the event of damage, the customer's health status, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they learned of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided to the pharmacies, data on the purchase of drugs from the person in the eighteen months that have passed. From that, the program determines itself, what disease the person is suffering and what is his or her health condition.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high rate of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is no greater need to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems can still occur.
Among the disadvantages of this program, it is found that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or heat tings, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed into data research and analysis, and they must seek permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
In the future, they are constrained by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past shortcomings.
In recent years, some companies have also been dealing with laboratory analysis results, linking them with drug use data, and thus are able to provide even more accurate picture of the patient's health.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and that is why he has further developed his program, which would require the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement or not, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, in the end, hens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to the other, largely global issues.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India, where there will be a major issue of Atomic Energy Cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is a great emerging democratic power to which it should give a broader right of speech in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not go too far on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would increase trade by two, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not appear to be too ambitious.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade will also be able to expand in future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with one side, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and it is urgent to hold a United Nations conference on this issue.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been sought, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce by at least twenty per cent its releases of toxic materials by 2020.
India also agreed on this issue, as well as on the fact that a global market should be put in place at the climate conference scheduled next year, and the emission of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now going to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the press agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the Salon with more than 403 thousand exhibition titles, and Turkey as guest of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, in the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmese: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign books is gradually diminishing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular to that for adults and children.
I found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane wreck, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, expressed the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is what Steve Fosset was travelling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore explained that no human remains were found on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered to have died .
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wrecking, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the species money and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world's turn on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world by plane and without a stopover.
Of all these records, also the one to have stolen at 15,445 meters high on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common of an original and well-defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and clean angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from 17 October next.
Thus the advertising campaign that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a brand car.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the Remom8 innovative technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new into the stereotypical domain of automotive communication.
Will she manage with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has now been ashamed of? They are part of the Ultras Italy group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, to date, has never created serious problems.
She's never had a fight with the opposite typhoid.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) of Campania and Poilles have been added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all taken away so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoid.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosis of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian typhosis, 144 tickets for the party: all nominal, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typhosis who had history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not travel.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the events that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, typhosis arrested or identified in disorder may purge a Daspo for at least five years .
An international Daspo which prohibits the attendance of Italian, but also European, stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand at the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others are likely to add to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We need to extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially for the national team match on Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Poilles there is indeed a small core of Ultras Italy supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday, the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which are dealing with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce choirs, and the arms held during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzelli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a prefect in Trieste, where he resides a supporter core of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add the Observatory #1 - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to Mameli's hymn: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they're not police..."
