Cumulative coronavirus disease incident (COVID-19) rapidly increasing in the European Union/Wilayah Economics Europe and England Raya, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar train in the United States of Europe/Wilayah Economie Europe and the British Raya that confirms that, despite the differing levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic developed very rapidly across the country.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units, an increase in the level of care required by COVID-19 patients, especially in intensive care, should be made available.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of unknown cases of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, Tyeongkok Disease Control and Prevention Center reported this disease's Kautif agent is a new coronavirus that is now called a heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19's patients have mild disease, or respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients being cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a heavier disease and required hospital care, while 6% of other cases experienced critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated in the hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we studied the cumulative COVID-19 incident in the United States of Europe/Wilayah Economics Europe (EU/EEA) and the British Raya (UK) and compared it to the incident in Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during January 31–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has been geographically spreading further and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world at the moment following the pandemic dynamics in Tyeongkok.
On March 11, 2020, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed based on the definition of the WHO case.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed first cases were reported by French on January 24, 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, the COVID-19 case has been detected throughout 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with the date included, there are 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incident COVID case-19
At the European Disease Control and Prevention Center (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases that each country in the world was updated every day at 8:00 a.m. This amount was obtained from only official sources such as the State Health Ministry, the national and regional health authority, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it to the train in Italy.
As a proxim of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incident of 14 days, so we calculated the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases that each country reported until 15 March 2020 at 8:00 compared to the Italian case during the 31st January–15March 2020 period.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK countries
The cumulative incident was 14 days COVID-19 case in the EU/EEA and the UK generally followed a train in Hubei Province (Tionkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK overall, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to increase by about 21 February, and then a sharp increase about 28 February 2020 (additional gain).
This train is primarily driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar COVID-19 cumulative increase (Additional Pay).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared with the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data highlights that, by March 15, 8:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of cases reported to be COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
A train observed in the COVID-19 cumulative incident claimed that pandemics are increasing at speeds comparable to those in all countries.
This is beyond the country's stage of difference, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in the definition of a case between the country and the protocol to choose a patient to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes the testing of solubility.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the affected area explained the situation of about 10% COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that the hospital and intensive care units in the region had reached maximum capacity.
Currently, the COVID-19 reception data in the hospital and/or intensive care units at the EU/EAA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to complete the current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study conducted in 2010-2011 showed a wide range of intensive care and care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and medical care per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario related to the genius of health care capacity, with the prevalence of prevalence of in-patient COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK risk-related >90% beyond the capacity of intensive care bed, is available on the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of ECDC regarding COVID-19.
Because thus far the most widespread case in certain areas in the EU/EEA and the UK, and the hospital and intensive care units usually serve the population of certain regional service coverage, information on cases and beds intensive care should be provided at the level of the Unit Area for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and the train now in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the transmission scenarios of SARS-COV-2 communities and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in the recent high risk assessment of ECDC, rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approaches are critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the approach to mitigating approaches, because the increase in the number of quick cases, as anticipated, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not applied before.
The rapid risk assessment also includes public health steps to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window of opportunity when the country has a chance to increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, other health care systems in the EU/EEA are likely to face a patient's spleen that needs intensive care in a few days or weeks to come.
The disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tyeongkok and elsewhere in the world, causing a disaster to mankind.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-COV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and caused symptoms similar through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has a lower level of severity and mortality than SARS, but it is more contagious and more about age than young people, and more about men than women.
As a response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this new disease, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensive reviews of rapidly expanding research subjects.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this review will help to understand and combat this threatening disease.
The Semi Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all the Tionghoa people who are told to stay at home for a few weeks on vacation and a few weeks later because of the new virus epidemic.
This virus is highly homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and disease that caused it is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemi started in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread throughout the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has led to 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the enemy of number 1" and potentially destroys more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 establishing a virus sequence isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review has sought to increase research in the rapidly developing new subject field.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV disease, which is central east breathing syndrome (MERS, outbreak 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting and some other but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered nonletal pathogens for humans, especially causing about 15% pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-COV and MERS-COV, each causing the outbreak that started in Tionkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
So, COVID-19 is now the third CoV plague in human history that has been recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the original class of pneumonia was first reported from the Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Public Health Commission.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the health care provider's infection was reported, which implied that human-to-human transmission might occur.
On January 23, forty territories were held in the town of Wuhan and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Food Market that was considered the initial site of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague a global health emergency.
By the time the report was written, the disease had spread throughout Tyeongkok and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
Because situations develop very quickly, final coverage and plagues still have to be established.
On 11 February 2020, multi-centered studies on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, present the following updated epidemic images (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at age 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people over 50 years of age, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 more infects men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in the class, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the afternoon to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from dawn to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Base reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of mass transport before the Semi Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality for all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large clustered subfamily virus that contains unique sense RNAs.
CoV can be divided into four genes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-coV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonsillan or spike (S) cover is associated with the receptor cell, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) enzyme and peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-COV and MERS-COV, then the membrane fusion occurs.
RNA gene virus released into sitoplasma; after replication of the virus genome, genomic RNA is accompanied by sabum glycoprotein and nucleopasid protein form a virus-containing vesicle, which then undergo fusion with a plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-COV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is a new type of beta-COV with a genetic similarity of over 99.98% of the 10 samples being taken from the site of the outbreak, the John Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is more like SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through transmission electron microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in a very thin human breath channel epithelium.
ACE2 humans were found to be receivers for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
Even so, S SARS-COV-2 protein has weaker human ACE2 than its bond to S SARS-COV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes non-separate infections of SARS-COV infection in patients.
SARS-COV-2 can also form a new short protein that is sealed with an orf3b and a protein that is secreted with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-COV-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of viruses and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no functional domain or known pattern.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM structure ACE2 in resolution 2.9 and in a complex with transporting amino acid B0AT1.
They found that complexes, which have open and closed conformations, are structured to form dimers and ACE2-B0AT1 complexes can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for detection and CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug separation to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
The spring and the middle
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to come from bats and each one is transmitted to humans through flies and camels.
By comparing the phylogenetic SARS-COV-2 to the other CoV, bats are considered as original SARS-COV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two coVs similar to the bat-SL-COVZX45 and the bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, intermediate waters that help the virus cross species barrier to infecting humans are still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. propose snakes as carriers of bat viruses to humans involved in homologous recombinations in S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggest that scissors, mummy mammals with long ants that are often used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, are potent as an interspersive SARS-COV-2, based on 99% genetic homologies on CoV found in the stiltling and SARS-COV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences across the whole of the genome are still huge differences; therefore, a conclusive result as concrete evidence has not yet been achieved (G. 3).
The physicochemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40 %-50% humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have a similar character.
It is reported that SARS-COV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant containing chlorine, peraset, chloroform, and other fat scouring, but not chlorohexidine, effective disabling viruses.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-COV-2 and that's vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies that report the immunological response to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to the previous CoV research, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Gbr. 4).
Generally, after invasion of the ingest, the virus is known by the immune system by means of the pattern receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses induce expressions of inflammatory factor, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon-type I synthesis (IFN) that restrict the spread of viruses and accelerate phagositosis of antigen viruses by macrophages.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help prevent immune response.
Soon afterward, adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that are specific to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
The T-cell helper produces a pre-inflammatory sitokin to help protect the cell.
However, CoV can hinder the function of T-cell by inducing apoptosis of T-cells.
Humoral communities, which include complexes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of mammoth organs and even death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, which is marked with an early class, is more about age with an adult with a pregnant woman and a pregnant woman.
Generally, people who are exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune functions are disturbed have a chance of being infected higher than others.
Estimated average SARS-COV-2 incubation period is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average period of incubation was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as explained above, shows that the period of incubation 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographics 8,866 cases.
It is important to adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of incubation that prevents infected people, but without symptoms, transmit viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine last for 24 days?
Fever is often the main and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without any other symptoms, such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, coils, headache, throat disease, rhinorea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxaemia one week after an outbreak.
In heavy cases, the development of patients' disease is rapidly becoming acute breathing syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who suffer from fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and acute fever, despite the absence of lung imaging, must be covered against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% for patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, such as studies in family and classrooms that result from transmission from asymtomatic individuals.
Compared to that, a 2012 demographic study showed that the MERS-CoV patients also experienced a fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the MERS mortality higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat disease (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and throat disease (13-5%) indicated as major symptoms and ventilation support is required for approximately 14%-20% patients.
By February 14th, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the confirmed 8,096 cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, mortality is 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous study reported that R0 SARS-COV-2 reaches 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-COV is only 2 to 4.
The comparison between SARS-COV-2 and MERS-COV and SARS-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-COV-2 has a higher ability to spread than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but it doesn't kill the MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-COV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV pandemic.
The netizens are often found in one family or in one group or by a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in other affected Wohans or areas or have contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the evening.
However, it is reported that people can carry a virus without showing symptoms more than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can carry another virus, which leads to caution to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have the count of white blood cells perifer (usually normal lymphocytes) or lower.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and increased aspartate aminotransferase and viremia found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Heart and muscle enzymes and hemoglobin increased in the blood of a number of patients, and C-reactive proteins and blood flow increased in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer levels increase, i.e. fibrin synthesis products in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Photo-toraks damage was found in the great role of COVID-19 patients and marked with bilateral mixed shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, the inflammation of control, the accumulation of fluids, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbates the disruption of the gas exchange.
Dysfunction of pneumositis type I and type II lowers sulphate levels and increases surface pressure so that lung capacity is lowered to develop and increase the risk of pulmonary colapsing.
As a result, the worst finding on the thoracic photos is often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumositis desquamation, hialin membrane production, interstisial lymphocyte infiltration, and synitial cells were numerous in patients' lungs that died of this disease, according to the pathology of virus infection and ARDS and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-COV-2 RNA detection via a back transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the level of false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, the clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and should be made effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol to use SHERLOCK based CRISPR to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-COV-2 fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a pen in less than one hour without requiring a complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease when verified on the clinical sample.
Because of the lack of experience with new CoV, the doctor mainly offers support to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously referred to other CoV treatments, such as SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a patient who has been cured is proposed to be used in therapy.
The local pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning, SARS-COV-2 primarily attacked the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, the functioning and failure of breathing are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, air support is vital for easing symptoms and saving lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with heavy respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporum membrane oxygen (ECMO), which is a thermodified cardiopulmoner shortcut technique used to treat heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and the protection of vital organ functions are also important for SARS-COV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in a sitokin storm in SARS and MERS patients.
The sitokin storm is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the release of the sitokin series, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These sytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and failure of mammoth organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of sitokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Kortikosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to handle the sitin storm.
Another immunosuppressive control for sitokin storms includes modulation of immune response that is transmitted T-cells; IFN-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, has been used in SARS care to reduce inflammatory damage.
However, high dose steroids are useless to heavy lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly influence prognosis.
Even so, short corticosteroid gifts at low doses are being advised to be given carefully to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous redesivir, an analog nucleotide, was found to be active in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, which is back for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, redesivir also showed inhibitions against other single camel RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for Tiongkok to perform a series of tests on infected SARS-COV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Additionally, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, heart failure, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with the other drugs that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma of a patient who has been cured and made antibodies
There is a long history of a patient’s collection of blood that has been cured from a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent the health care from becoming infected.
True, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high antibody level in their blood.
Antibodi is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are treated to 10 patients who are seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, along with lower inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done to present the method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma - related deficiencies have to be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune responses and cause sitekin release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Antibodi concentration in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to treat patients with critical disease.
Development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to combat global epidemics is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify genetic codes that serve effective antibodies or perform effective antibodies removals to proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tyeongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 have not yet been present, CCM is one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms up to now or for people who recover from heavy illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be suitable for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest rate of recovery in COVID-19 patients is observed in some TCM provinces in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei provinces, which use CCM only at about 30% of COVID-19 patients, have a lower rate of recovery (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends gave a study that compared western drug therapy (WM) alone with the combination therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it takes for the recovery of the body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the inhalation is much shorter on the WM+TCM group than just the WM group.
What's more impressive is that the rate of seizure of the symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and security of the JVT still await better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to describe working mechanisms and to clarify effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are very afraid of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those with quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
At the early stage of SARS, a series of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides were reported.
The tracking of contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to COVID-19 disease, can make people more worried and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, people expected, and those in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include team-building mental health multidiscipliner, clear communication with routine and accurate updates of SARS-COV-2 disease, and plan therapy and device use and professional electronic application to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to break the transmission chain from the animal and human reservoir infected with vulnerable angels and are often expected to complete antivirus therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus outbreaks.
It has been done to develop S-based vaccines, which are long-term and effective in creating penetration antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-COV.
For SARS, the live-fall vaccine has been evaluated on experimental animals.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in age and model lethal challenge and protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
It's probably because SARS went down 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Instead, the Mers sporadic and classer cases continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because of continued zoonotic resources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasma, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombination protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
Development of vaccines against safe and effective SARS-COV-2 for non-immuns is a very urgent and important task of controlling ongoing epidemics.
However, this difficulty is not easy because it is a long time to develop vaccines (about 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show a clinical journey full of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to get better without a single cure.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with heavy cases.
Therefore, the model of disease prognosis is very important to the health care system in order to prioritize its service, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with COVID-19 patient prognosis (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor in SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 in studies containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who are in need of intensive care tend to have a comorbidity of presentations and complications and significantly older patients than patients who do not require intensive care (meaning 66 years to 51 years), who refer to age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-COV-2 more infects men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Komorbiditas and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
Heart events also lost the main reason for death in SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 is also reported to be related to a cohabitation with ACE2-positive, which can cause heart failure in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying illness are highly interrelated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue injury and is expressed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and end recovery.
The correlation between the CRP and the severity and the COVID-19 prognosis has also been resolved.
In addition, increased dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart function.
The main clinical symptoms: Photo thoracics and the development of the temporal clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the end results and complexity of the COVID-19.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are a widely used immunosuppressive therapy for infection to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high dose corticosteroid is widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term doses on COVID-19 patients.
Mental Pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 disease, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological image different from SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other coVs that cause pills.
Therefore, at the early stage or incubation, infected patients can produce large amounts of viruses during day-to-day activities, which cause great difficulty in controlling epidemics.
However, SARS-COV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur at the early stage.
Thus, COVID-19 disease is now much worse and difficult to control than SARS.
Currently, major efforts are being made in Tyeongkok, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan and surrounding cities and the surrounding cities, and the continuation of nearly all populations with the hope of dissolving SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Even though this has been very damaging to the economy and to other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has declined, which indicates the outbreak of epidemics.
Most optimistic estimates indicate the outbreak will end in March and the phase of the decline will take place for 3-4 months.
Some other experts, however, were not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-COV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
Canadian research group reported that SARS-COV-2 was detected in mid-kilometers and patient throats who had been cured and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the reidentified virus could be repeated episodes, similar to the influenza.
Even so, the promising signs happen in Tyeongkok, if seen based on a decrease in the number of new cases, which shows that the current strategy may work.
Ebola is predicted to cause a million cases with half death as well.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, this disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe, too, like SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2 is losing its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that is not too pathogenic that can be side-by-side with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-COV-2 is easily transmitted through cough or sneeze, and may also be through direct contact with virus-contaminated substances.
The virus was also found in the feses so it revealed the possibility of a new transmission, that is, the transmission of feses-to-mouth.
Recently, a study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosomomyal infection, which includes 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, careful precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially those providing health care, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those who are coincidentally in contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgeons ensure that the spitting of someone with the potential for infection is not airborne or attached to the surface of the substance, where those skin sparks can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series number 1860-years) masks that can protect against virion inhalation with a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely detach; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because the particle can degrade even five sedative masks that are stacked into one, the health care provider that is directly in contact with the patient should wear N95 (series of the 1860s) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers need to wear insulation suits that fit to reduce contact with the virus.
A virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-COV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus might go into his body through the eyelid.
Therefore, health - care providers should also wear a face shield of the eye or glasses while working with patients.
For the public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that each person wash his hands with soap disinfected more often than usual, try to stay at home for quarantine, and avoid contact with potential infected people.
Three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to Tiongkok with strong memories of SARS outbreaks in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calms people by saying that this new virus has a low level of exposure and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and this disease prevention and removal is not a problem.
This message was very soothing to the public, especially when the whole country was preparing the Semi Museum Festival, so that this critical time was spent to halt the disease that was still small in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Tyeongkok should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the people and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-standard information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restricting the potential of epidemics at the early stage, rather than trying to relax the public; and (4) more often giving targeted and effective training to improve public awareness of the epidemic and testing and increasing the public response system on a regular basis.
COVID-19 disease caused by a new SARS-COV-2 virus that began to burn at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Tyeongkok and more than 50 countries in the world during this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and COVID-19 symptoms, and SARS is similar, the COVID-19 disease has given an impression of the resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are vital to developing epidemics and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, and the death rate is also higher in age than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% than 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit viruses even when they don't have symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they're very ill, which makes it more difficult to block COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons that SARS-COV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-COV.
Asai RNA routine to examine SARS-COV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can have a positive effect on the virus check.
These findings greatly increase the risk of virus spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although genetic homologies were found to be 96% between SARS-COV-2 and two similar COV-SARS bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 is from bats.
What animal is an intermediate species to transmit the virus from its origin, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to number 1 and 2, we can't break the transmission effectively and the plague can break back at any time.
Although molecular and biochemistry models indicate that SARS-COV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cell and lead to further pathological changes?
Does this virus also have to do with cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission between humans?
Is this pandemic going to be a pandemic all over the world, ending up like SARS, or repeating it periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Still, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to get back to normal life.
Zoonotic human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved co-evolution of corona virus (COV) and its ingenuity, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCOVs) were known to cause minor diseases, such as solvency.
A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how much HCOV infection can damage and threaten the soul.
SARS-COV-2 in Tionkok center at the end of 2019 has made CoV a backseat and startled us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogenicity than his brother SARS-COV.
The HCOV infection is zoonosis, so understanding of the origin of HCov zoonotics will benefit us.
Most HCOV comes from bats, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
The water reservoir between several HCOVs has also been known.
Identification of animals has a direct involvement in human disease prevention.
The investigation of CoV-inang interactions in animals can also provide important insight into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current public knowledge of seven HCOVs, focusing on its history of discovery and zoonotics and transmitting its interspecies.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted the HCOV from the perspective of evolution and genome recombination.
COV's disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, successful exercise requirements and the implications of the evolution of viruses for disease disorders are also highlighted.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of overlapping RNA viruses, positive indwellings, and single ventilating.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms among the RNA virus called "COV", because its morphology is similar to the crown under the electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar approach.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-breathed (ORF1a and ORF1b) lines that overlap, both of which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyprotein.
Polyprotein has further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of open-read (ORF) framework for structural protein, which includes spike (S), membrane or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of coating proteins that are specific to certain lineages are also provided by a number of CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified as four genes (alpha-Cov, beta-Cov, gamma-Cov, and delta-COV); among these four genes, the beta-Cov gene has the most HCOV and is divided back into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-coV and beta-coV genes, while the phylogenetics are the main gamma-coV and delta-coV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barrier and some CoV has become important pathogens in humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-COV.
Five other beta-coVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, a heavy acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), a central east respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-COV), and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing heavy lower respiratory infection in relatively more patients and has a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organ.
Strain HCOV-229E first, B814, isolated from the thinning patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through deep studies of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both causing symptoms to heal themselves.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is generally harmless, until SARS disease occurs.
SARS disease that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive epidemics in today's history, which infects over 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East (MERS) outbreak of respiratory syndrome resulted in continued epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
New 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), the next known as SARS-CoV-2, is a deadly epidemitic epidemitic virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3,120 lives and infects more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm has gone off and the world has to prepare itself for the coming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
These seven HCOVs all have the zoonotic origin of bats, rats, or pets.
There's a lot of evidence to support the evolution of all HCOVs from bats.
The COVID-19 epidemic has given rise to an extraordinary medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for Tiongkok and the whole world.
The HCOV zoonotics trace gives a job to understand the natural history, the driving force, and the limiting factor of the interspecies displacement.
This study can also guide or facilitate search for reservoir animals, internautrons, and SARS-COV-2 amplification, which has important implications for the prevention of the spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a general overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCOV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general issue that HCOV's parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but it becomes pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to new waters.
We also state the HCOV evolution train that transmission capacity increases are often accompanied by reduced pathogenicity.
The final result of SARS-COV-2 epidemics is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first HCOV-229E strain B814 of the sedated patients, various CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last few decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
Brief overview of the history of HCOV in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
Strain HCOV-229E was first isolated from a patient's respiratory channel that had upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was then adapted to be grown in WI-38 lung lines.
Infected HCOV-229E patients show spleen symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, leukus, and throat disorders, accompanied by fever and cough that are seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and series lines in the brain that were still sucking.
The clinical description of HCOV-OC43 infection seems to be similar to the infection caused by HCOV-229E, which can't be distinguished by the pathogen infection of other respiratory channels such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are spreading worldwide and tending most of them to be transmitted during the winter in the current climate.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by a period of pain for about 2 weeks.
Based on a voluntary human study, a healthy person infected with HCOV-229E experienced a mild solution.
Only a few patients with a weakened immune system show a low respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "typical pneumonia", is the first well documented HCOV pandemic in human history and its etiologic agent is SARS-COV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
SARS epidemics have resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which are spread in many countries and continents.
In spite of the supersede, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with four to seven days incubation, and the top of the virus burden is seen on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV first experienced mialgia, headache, fever, fainting, and shivering, followed by dyspnea, cough, and breathing disorders as further symptoms.
Lymphopenia, unusual heart function tests, and kinase creatinine enhancements are the most common laboratory disorders in SARS.
The damage to alveolar diffusion, epithel cell proliferation, and macrophag increase are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by a sitokin storm, which can be lethal, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from open-label lung biopsy patients travelling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from the seven-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially very common for children, elderly ones, and patients who were still weak and suffering from respiratory disease.
A description of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and lacy bronchiolitis is found in HCOV-NL63's disease.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from 8-month-old nasal specimens that suffer from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and the peak of the event occurs at the beginning of the summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is linked to obstructive laryngitis, also called krup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was treated in a state of insanity because of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exabaration.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild breathing disease.
Although four HCOV communities have been adapted to humans and are generally small in number to become highly pathogenic, an extraordinary case is the reason for the unknown, as in the case of subtype HCOV-NL63 more virulent than recently reported causing heavy low-breath infection in Tiongkok.
Generally, when it is able to move efficiently and continue to maintain itself within humans, this HCOV virulence and pathogenicity also decreases.
MERS-COV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases came from the Middle East, once in a secondary case of close contact, reports have been made in various countries of Europe and Tunisia.
Other secondary outbreaks occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which states with progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute kidney failure, which so far only happens to MERS among HCOV-related diseases.
More than 30% patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high case death, which is 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a classer of patients with retrospective pneumonia was associated with SARS-COV-2 infection found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the disease of the ongoing low respiratory infection is caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and names the COVID-19 disease.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death rate of 3.4%.
It needs to be recorded, the death of a case in Hubei, Tiongkok, 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 caused a heavy respiratory infection like SARS-COV and MERS-COV with a picture of fever, cough, and breathing.
Diare is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can grow rapidly into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homology, 82%, both cluster into different phylogenetic tree branches.
The Patagonism of SARS-COV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious than the SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Subject infected SARS-COV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-COV-2 around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-COV-2 with six other HCOVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the time of incubation and duration of HCOV disease travel is very similar.
In this case, SARS-COV-2 follows the other six HCOV general trains.
Second, COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and four other communities (yakni HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of community HCOV infection, which includes a slight non-specific or even no symptoms image.
On the other hand, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-COV infections even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-COV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, has a resemblance to both HCOV community and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as HCOV communities.
On the other hand, it decreases the ability to transmit SARS-COV-2 after several pathways to humans, as in SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Last, just like the other HCOV, SARS-COV-2 can be detected from a sample of feses.
"Has SARS-COV-2 fecal-oral transmission played an important role, as in the case of SARS-COV transmission, at least in certain situations, it still has to be clarified by the next study."
It's also very important to know if SARS-COV-2 is a season like in the HCOV community case.
In any case, the image of SARS-COV-2, which includes transmission capacity, pathogenesis, and continued spread in some pathways on humans, will have a strong impact on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 plague.
Four HCOV communities that cause mild symptoms all have adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, either HCOV or humans may be an ancient HCOV pandemic species.
HCOVs that cause heavy disease for humans and humans who experience heavy HCOV disease have been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCOV needs to replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to be cumulative against the factors of abstinence.
Thus, the longer the SARS-COV-2 disease survives and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four CoV communities have been leaving in the human population and triggering the finality of the immunocompetent people.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
On the other hand, very pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and carry out breeding in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermittent waves and amplifications.
SARS-COV-2 has a similar picture of SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-COV-2 is very easy to transmit as HCOV communities, at least now.
However, SARS-COV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV communities and is not a spatiogenic SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-COV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without reservoir animals or interweaves.
Before we discuss the origin of HCOV animals, we need to discuss definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, interment, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as evolutionary HCOVs if they have close relatives and share high homologous levels in the nucleotide sequence.
The ancient virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this sea.
Similarly, the reservoir carries the HCOV continuously and over a long period of time.
In both of these cases, the swim is naturally infected and is the natural swim for HCOV or the mother virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has recently entered the intermittent water just before or about the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not been adapted to the new and often pathogenic.
The water between these birds can function as a source of zoonotic human infection and act as an amplification bird by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to enhance the scale of human infection.
HCOV can experience a dead end infection if it can't sustain transmission in an intermittent wave.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to the permanence of water and even cause long-term indebtedness.
In this case, the midwife became the natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveals that the zero SARS case has a history of contact with vultures.
The subsequent study of seroprevalence indicates that the sellers have a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-COV IgG than the general population.
Mosang Luna (Paguma larvata) and larvata dogs in the live animal market are the first to be identified to carry similar SARS-COV viruses that are almost identical to SARS-COV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the riots in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that the moon snails from the wild or unpaved farm to the live animal market mostly give a negative test for SARS-COV, which means that the moon snails may only act as an amplification bird between, but not the natural resorvoir of the SARS-COV.
It needs to be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be added that many small mammal species may also function as an amplification bird between SARS-CoVs.
All these waters seem to be the end of the SARS-COV.
The search for natural animal birds for SARS-CoV next reveals the nearby bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus bat Rhinolopus relatives HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found on the bat of the Thongkok horse.
These bats gave positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequencers SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genes.
This coV and the other bat CoV share the next nucleotide-sequent homologous 88-92% with SARS-COV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that bats are the navels for new human pathogens.
Some similar CoVs (SL-COV) are also identified by bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The known angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from bat feses sample is shown using bat, bat, and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interesting thing, saRS convalesen serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents an ancestor closest to the SARS-COV in the bat, with a 95% sequencing nucleotide homology.
Despite the homologous height between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a live parent virus SARS-COV and bats are not a direct SARS-COV reservoir.
The phylogenetic analysis pumped the MERS-COV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bats and the CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-COVs use the same swimming receptor, peptide peptide 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry.
Sequen RNA polymerase hangs-RNA MERS-CoV in phylogenetics closer to its grip on the bat beta-coV identified by Europe and Africa.
Until now, no living MERS-COV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-COV and his closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bat only share 87% nucleotide sequence homologous.
That's why bats might not be a direct MERS-COV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels produce seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-COV, like Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-COV's life is identical with the virus found in humans isolated from the root mole of Arab camels, which indicates further that camels are the actual reservoirs for MERS-COV.
It's also important to note that the whole massive virus with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on the experimental camel that is infected with MERS-COV.
Need to be noted, the infected camels are not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the entire virus from the bat.
However, the question is still unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels before the symptoms, possibly as a result of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission route involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homologous with RATG13 bat coV that is isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
Like in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases, the sexual differences between SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 are too big to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be the direct SARS-COV-2 reservoir, unless the almost identical coV is found in later days.
It is likely that the bird between SARS-COV-2 is one of the species of wildlife that was sold and killed at the John Sea Food Market, a number of early cases of COVID-19 related to this market, indicating the possibility of transmission of animals.
Some of the latest studies based on a metagenomic sequence show that a small group of extinct mammals, known as the trentiling (Javanica Manis), may also carry beta-coV ancestors who are related to SARS-COV-2.
The new genom CoV trengiling shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homologous with SARS-COV-2.
However, the CoV is close to the ratio of the RatG13 to the ratio of 90% on the secondary level of nucleotide.
Both are grouped into two subgaris-derived viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees, one of which is divided into the receptor (RBD) treatment domain that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
It's striking, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 is even more different, although the next level of homology is higher across the whole genome.
A previous study of ill trengiling also reported contiguous viral detection of lung samples, which also turned out to be related to SARS-COV-2.
This study adopts a different method of withdrawal and manual curatives to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of approximately 86.3% complete virus genomes.
We can't sidetrack the plausible trengiling as one of the birds between SARS-COV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-COV-2 coming directly from the trengiling because of the sequence between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2 skewering.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary SARS-COV-2 route in bats, trengiling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest sequestrian homology on RBD was found between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2 trengiling, SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 share the highest homologous level of the entire genome.
It's too much to speculate if it's said that the degree of similarity between the beta-coV RBD-sars-coV-2's family-sars-coV-2's strangling and SARS-COV-2 is driven by the selected convergence evolution.
Hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-coV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trengilling and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a factor in driving evolution, a lot of recombination occurs between beta-coVs.
The researchers still can't decide on the origin of the SARS-COV-2 zoonotics.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may come from bat coV, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 stem viruses have been found in rodent animals.
Reportedly, the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) that was detected at the three-coloured North American bat shows a rapport close to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically associated with the other bat CoV, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which is detected in Ghana, and Camelidae is also suspected to be its interwealth.
To make it clear, today's knowledge of the origin of known HCOV animals is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of interspecies transmission of HCOV in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed species of livestock to infect humans, reports a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of interspecies HCOV-229E transmission is not too clear.
The bat Alpha-CoV that is friendly with HCOV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not the alkamas, may be connected with bats in common ecologism.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the apka.
Second, the bat alpha-CoV that is related to HCOV-229E has a variety of nonpathogenic and nonpathogenic in the bat, while alpha-CoV alpapapa causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Last, alpha-CoV alpaka was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the alkaka may have alpha-CoV relatives-HCOV-229E from humans cannot be sided.
In fact, bats are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not very surprising that bats may immediately transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV bat functions as a long HCOV-229E gene, the alpaka and the Arab camel may function as the intermittent bird that transmits the virus to humans, just like the MERS-COV case.
MERS-COV is a very good example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary MERS-COV of bats is known to identify early viruses and is also reinforced with subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a long, rich virus species for the exchange of interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-term age, organized colonies, strong social interactions, and strong flying capabilities, all are conditions that support bats to be ideal 'virus spread'.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to the camels that have changed from the midwives to a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-COV caused a very light and maintained relatively low mutation rate in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by coincidence and humans remain the ultimate inhalation for the MERS-COV because its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the camel's role in the MERS-COV transmission, the trengiling role, if any, in the different SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Especially, the beta-coV trengiling is highly pathogenic in the trengiling.
The scissors may be an end to beta-coV relatives SARS-COV-2, similar to the wrinkles in the SARS-COV case.
In future studies, some potential interspecies transmission of SARS-COV-2 from animals to humans has to be counted or separated.
First, bats could be a reservoir for a SARS-COV-2 family virus that's almost identical with SARS-COV-2.
Humans can share the ecological range with bats through the slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the trengiling could be one of the intermittent amplification birds for newly entered SARS-COV-2 relatives.
Humans get viruses through the slaughter and consumption of filth meat.
It's possible, a lot of mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS-COV-2.
Antibodies' surveillance of pets and wild animals needs to be done.
The third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 may occur in a third species that is connected to both bats and trengiling.
The search for SARS-COV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from the various kinds of animals, three main factors on the side of the virus are also important to make it easier to cross the species barrier.
First, it's a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-acting RNA virus, an estimated CoV mutation rate can be considered as "as high" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per target, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new angles.
CoV has a correctional exoribonukules, a removal that leads to very high mutability, attenuation, or even ineligibility.
Interestingly, the analog nucleotide Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribunuklease and RNA polymerase hanging-RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutations is about one million times higher than the rate of its angle mutation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when CoV is not adapted to the water.
Compared to the SARS-COV that has a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-COV-2 mutation is actually lower, signifying a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Possibly, SARS-COV-2 has adapted to another swimming that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-COV-2, this also applies to the MERS-COV that has adapted to the Arab camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic hyphens will quickly create vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-COV-2 become ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoV at appropriate conditions.
It's supported by a lot of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are attached to the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoVs change the template randomly during RNA replication through unique "choice-salin" mechanisms.
In the waters that function as mixing vessels, the fluidity of the camel occurs during the RNA CoV transcription.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can be recombined to form new CoV.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as on animal coVs like bat SL-CoV and coV-HKU9 bats.
Virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with the inhaled receptor is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on the comparative analysis between human-coV-SARS isolates and musang, SARS-CoV is expected to have rapid adaptations in different rivers, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD S CoV protein interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target of an antibodies inhalation response.
In SARS-COV, RBD is amino acid from 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which is related to human ACE2 and its correlations as a virus entry.
RBD SARS-COV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, bats, rats, and rakun dogs, allowing interspecies virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues that are observed differing between human and musk isolates in the RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor coating motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of protein-brushing interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein S unit implies the affinity of S protein binding with ACE2 is likely to change.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 binding affinity and S SARS-COV-2 protein-10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-COV protein.
The important thing to know is whether there's any other match that might be needed to transmit SARS-COV-2.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 also has to do with ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as an aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-teracetylase silage acid for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of its animals.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of interspecies HCOV transmission is also arranged by the factor of dependence and other restriction of the inhalation.
This difference between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV must take over the influence of the dependency factor and break down the influence of the inhalation factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants of these important viruses' interactions still need to be identified and indicated.
The whole genome capping is not biased to see the impact of the survival and restriction of the SARS-CoV-2 by using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCOV's rise: Back to the beginning of the plague
The bat CoV has given a great chance to show up the new HCOV.
In this case, bat coVs function as a protracted HCOV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also move HCOV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, perils or the loss of new protein receptors have the potential to dramatically modify the phenotype of the virus.
Among the SARS-COV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-COV bat virus was found to contain multiple ORF8 proteins.
SARS-COV with a distinctive feature of the removal of 29 nucleotides found in the isolated strain at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports the flow of love.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-COV and gamma-COV lineages, with a large number of smaller areas of recombination identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination of various lineages took place in the epidemic of MERS-COV, which occurred in the Arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the recombination has also been observed at other HCOV sites where HCOV has been recombined with other animal CoV in its nonstructural gene.
It should also be kept in mind that artificial selection can play a role in the involuntary change in the viral genome, which is most likely caused by the release of viruses from the pressure of the selection, such as the inhaled immune system.
The example of this effect is the complete ORF4 loss of the strain of HCOV-229E prototype as a result of the elimination of two nucleotides.
While the whole ORF4 can be observed on the bat and camel viruses that are related to HCOV-229E, alpha-CoV alpapa shows a single nucleotide-combination that results in motion movements.
Finally, the new HCOV evolution was also driven by the pressure of the selection in its reservoir.
Small or undetected symptoms when the bat is infected with CoV, which shows an adaptation between CoV and bats.
Looks like bats fit well with CoV through anatomy and physiology.
For example, a deficiency in the activation of the proinflammation response on the bat will effectively lower the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, natural killer cell activity on bats is pressed because of an increase in natural killer cell receptor regulation by NKG2/CD94 and a low-class histococompatibility complex molecular level.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and influence exoribonuclease corrections so that it gives selective pressure to create highly pathogenic strains when entering the new water.
A more pathogenic Strain CoV may also develop through recombination, which leads to a new strain of protein or a new phase of protein for the adaptation of the swim.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two basics.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering strong immune response.
This is where the secret lies that the carriers are without symptoms and cause heavy cases of human infection.
The symptoms are particularly severe due to excessive immune response and sitokine storms, with increased lung damage if the immune response increases.
On the other hand, on the carrier without symptoms, the immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to determine the interaction of immune responses may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the interferon type I gift, at least in the early phase of SARS-COV-2 infection on humans, should be useful.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in the bat is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be beneficial in handling COVID-19.
SARS-COV-2's onset follows the general flow of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While bat beta-coVs share 95% nucleotide homologies with SARS-COV have been found, some bat coVs share 96% nucleotide homologies with SARS-COV-2.
Although the mosquitoes and other animals in the market were found to be carrying identical viruses with SARS-COV, the direct interment for SARS-COV-2 has not been found.
The highly homologous beta-coV-coV-SARS-COV-2 has been found, which shows that the trengiling may play a role as one of the intermittent or beta-coV-coV-straints may contribute a gene fragment to the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although questioned, there is no evidence that the SARS-COV-2 was created by either man on purpose or unintentionally.
CoV's back into the center of attention because of the recent SARS-COV-2 plague.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have changed our perceptions of the importance of zoonotics and animal reservoirs for HCOVs in human transmission.
Lots of evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermittent waters.
Considering that SARS-COV infection comes from the contact between humans and the wetlands in the wet market, it may be the closure of the wet market and the murder of all the wetlands in it that effectively brings an end to SARS epidemics.
For the same reason, the plating should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coV liners that are closely related to SARS-COV-2.
Even so, the truth and mechanism SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to humans through trengiling and other mammals still need to be classified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the Arab camel for a long time.
This camel serves as an important transportation tool and as a primary source for meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels spread widely throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the camels to control the MERS, as it is done at the market of wild animals in Tiongkok to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against the MERS-COV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genotypes can pop up and cause disease.
Several zoonotic CoVs are leaving in the wild.
Especially, the bat coV with zoonotic potential is very varied.
There is a lot of chance for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience a recombination, which causes new CoV to appear that is easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
Cultures eat wild animals in some places in Tyeongkok should be left to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and plans for action should be implemented.
Actually, many viruses have been on this planet for a long time.
These viruses are in the natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that support virus preaching, human prospects are less likely to be matched by bats and other wild species if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
The ongoing surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the CoV ecology and its natural nature, which will prove beneficial in preventing transmission of animals and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonoses of the virus is to keep humans within the range of the ecological reservoir nature of the zoonotic virus.
Some of the zoonotic puzzle parts of SARS-COV-2 have not been found.
First, if bats transmit SARS-COV-2's ancestor virus to the trengiling, the condition when bats and trengling share the echoology relay is an important thing to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans interact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intertwine, the mammalian's way of interacting with another species, which includes humans, bats, and trengling should be made clear.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-COV-2, both experimental and surveillance infections have to be done.
Either bats, trengilling, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-COV-2 or her almost identical parent virus can be identified in its future nature.
Further research in this field will outline evolutionary paths of SARS-COV-2 in animals, with an important involvement in prevention and control of COVID-19 on humans.
Criterion update diagnosis "expected case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to combat pandemics around the world.
Even so, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "expected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnostic and Maintenance Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Public Health Commission.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused disease, which is now formally referred to as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease and it is named coronavirus heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-COV-2 infection, our team developed rapid guidance and guidance has been published online in the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
Such guidance has long intrigued people.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, an increasing awareness and awareness based on ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Maintenance Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Population Health Commission (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts have changed quite much.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple gift score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guidance and became valuable references to this pandemic around the world.
We support the results of their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
Even so, the results of their work also require updates based on the Diagnostic and Maintenance Guidelines for the latest VOCID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the alleged case, it is necessary to combine one of the epidemiological narratives with two clinical manifestations to create a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestations need to be held if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or stay in and around the city of Wuhan, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the warning; (2) contact with a contagious SARS-CoV-2 case (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) contact with patients who experience fever or respiratory symptoms from and around the city of Wuhan, or other communities where the COVID case-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the rejection of the symptoms; (4) contact with confirmed classer case (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging feature COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts show normal lymphocyte count, decreases, or decreases at the early retirement stage.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on one of the suspected pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) Real-time positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the whole gene sequence of viruses showed high homogenity for new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific antibody IgM and antibodi IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or IgG-specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodi changes from negative to positive, or titer ≥4 folds in the recovery phase at the acute stage.
We can see that real-time nuclear acid PCR tests in air or blood samples added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence added in the seventh.
This modification is based on ongoing research by researchers to search for optimal nuclear acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory channel including blood intake, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of certain positive antibodies results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there are more and more evidence to remind us to guard our patients with atypical and unassuming symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s ring gangs must be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low vesicles".
The system of score also needs to be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
As a cover, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "expected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest to follow and obey the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also periodically update our guidance as a help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of reported cases of infection included 114 active cases and 33 home-based recovery cases.
Totally recorded 17 deaths.
In a online media culture, director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death involves four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the people who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitree Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridge, Obaidul Quader said that public transportation would be stopped longer than the previous planned until Saturday.
This public transport stop has started since March 26th and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two new people returning from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men cured.
SARS-COV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-COV-2 coronary infection over one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by a coronary virus.
His point occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed his first coronary virus infection and Zambia suffered his first death related to the coronary virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the virus's infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary virus have been reported, causing at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronary virus infections.
Around the world, countries announce stricter measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Mayor of Moscow, extended quarantine to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal's Parliament did a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was taken by 215 votes in support, ten abstain votes, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia extends the hours of the night in the holy city of Mekkah and Madinah until the whole day; before that, it only takes place between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand plans to apply the nighttime between 10:00 and 4:00 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state has extended the house - to - house order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower the purchase limits of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Woolworth and Coles stores each lowered the purchase limits of toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applied the limit of one sir, on Monday.
This bar was announced as a message in the register and on the Facebook page of his network.
The buyers were reported to build supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 that people would have to do isolation on their own.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for delivery home to one pack per order.
This change follows the restriction of four sirs per transaction previously applied to Woolworths and Coles each on March 4 and 5.
In his media statement on March 8, Coles reported that by doing the four-species restriction, "many stores are still running out in an hour since delivery," and called that request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
The sale "upgraded" last week, according to one of Woolworths' speakers.
Costco store in Canberra also restricted the number allowed until two packs last week.
To avoid any seizure, Coles ordered more packaging than the supplier and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made preparations for special Wednesday promotions available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australia’s Expert Association, said that the experts were trying to improve supplies, but the local government’s limitations for the time of truck delivery made it difficult.
It anticipates a high cost of production, while the supplier tries to meet the demand, and less special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of its earlier supply, some shops could not hold special Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retaliatory expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a large volume of stuff so that its supply is low and, when sold, it makes a lot of room in the shelf so that the supply of goods is getting more and more comfortable.
Coles and Woolworths believe that if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet tissue and injections can be [bought] and there's a huge amount, panic may be reduced, Russel Zimmerman's cousins through the ABC News Office.
Who Givens a Crap's refilled toilet tissue production said on Wednesday that they were out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who created Kleinex Toilet Tisu, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed them to work 24/7 to keep supplies, reports News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state website, reports that some property dealers offer free toilet paper to the first auction cure in Melbourne, when less auctions are held because the buyer takes breaks for long vacations late in the weekend of Labour Day.
The issue of Thursday NT News, a newspaper that was printed in Darwin, included eight separate pages that were intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops are actually refusing to apply limits, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3, they say that they are not planning to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, injections, dry foods, wash soap, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon, British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres' toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 disease—the disease caused by the SARS-COV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pendemi" refers only to how extensive the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries can still change the path of the pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We're very good students because of the levels of preaching and distress or because of the level of fearlessness.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States of America, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a February publication of CNN, "aside from influenza, no respiratory virus has been tracked from its onset to a continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state is following the WHO decision in January that states this plague as a disintegration of society.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious American Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this outbreak, "His intention, this plague is going to get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus Pandemi 2019-2020 is a continuing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic caused by heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was identified in Wuhan, Tionkok, in December 2019 as a Global Health Deficit on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tyeongkok, while worldwide is rising from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Public symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory failure.
Complications can cover pneumonia and acute breathing syndrome.
Time from sunrise to evenings is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antivirus treatment.
The primary treatment of symptomatic and supportive therapies is a preventive action that is recommended to wash your hands, close your mouth when you are coughing, keep your distance from others, and monitor and isolate those who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, night hours, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
This pandemic has caused severe global economic disturbances, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, religious, religious activities, and a wide range of supply supplies that are seriously damaged by panic.
Schools and universities have been shut down at both national and local levels in 193 countries, which have affected about 99.4 percent of the population worldwide.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against the people of Tionghoa, people with descendants and appearances of East Asia and Southeast, and people from the area with significant cases of viruses.
As a result of travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (Hubei province) report the class of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and investigations were carried out at the beginning of January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Johnan Seafood Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the disease is called SARS-COV-2, a virus that has just been discovered and is associated with the bat coronavirus, coronavirus is thin, and SARS-COV. The first person with the symptoms was then known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection with the wet market classer mentioned later.
Among the first case class that was reported in December 2019, two-thirds of the published were related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from the province of Hubei, was the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tyeongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of Tyeongkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tyeongkok for the first time.
There may be large numbers of unreported cases, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below, constitute 2.4% of cases throughout the world.
The case concerns the number of people tested by COVID-19 and the results of its tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tyeongkok, until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infection was not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the reported case.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that the figure is 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who do not recover, from the onset to the death of between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have previous health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual fatalities of COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures may not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations with 4-5 times the same factor.
A female spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admits, "We know [a number of reported deaths] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by a non-human report on too low reckoning in the U.S... Too low estimates often appear in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Tyeongkok ground occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14th.
Until 28 February, outside of Tyeongkok the land, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territorial areas have reported death, on each continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This figure varies according to the region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first plague, and the population character such as age, gender, and health as a whole. The ratio of death to the death rate reflects the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, the overall death ratio is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In Tiongkok, death ratio estimates for the case decreased by 17.3% (for people with an additional 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with an additional symptom after 1 February 2020).Another study covers the fatality of a case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who died from a particular disease.
The statistics are time-bound and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the mortality rate of infection for pandemics overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit on this estimate is based on the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical research that analyses the impact of the investigation on the CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of this plague are unclear and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University stated, "Without control, the epidemic usually spreads and then begins to subside when the disease is running out of available water.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection right now about when it happened."
Senior government medical advisor Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "this plague may end in June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice about steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-COV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraint and other steps will be necessary "so that vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear entirely" and this disease "maybe turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Virulence repeats will depend on group immunity and mutation levels.
The COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecific and the infected can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The uncommon symptoms include fatigue, the production of breath sputum (flegma), the loss of smell, breathlessness, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headache, stiffness, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea, or physis. WHO states that about one in six people became seriously ill and experienced difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include emergency symptoms that include breathing difficulties, stress or pain in the chests, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and blushing in the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms appear. Further disease development can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with the results that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are infected with those who are confirmed to be closely monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate the asymtomatic ratios ranged from a few to 44%.
The period of incubation (time between infection and symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, at most 5 days. For example, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost the initial smell strength of 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
The COVID-19 service is believed to have occurred especially at a time of close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that unsurfaced cough can cause a droplet to drive 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a little droplet that survives longer in the air and produced when speaking. The breath droplet can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or nose of someone close to him or maybe be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can make the secret of breathing turn into aerosols and spread through the air.
Service may also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Tiongkok government may have fecal-oral transmission of SARS-COV-2.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, even though it may occur before the symptoms appear and at the further stage of disease.
People tested positive until three days before the event, which signals transmission may occur before significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymtomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but an asymtomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during the investigation of contacts.
The European Disease Control and Prevention Center (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days in plastics (polypropylen) and armor 304, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature, and other pets have been tested positively by COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Coronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia sufferers associated with a classier case of acute breathing disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the SARS-COV-2 virus are related to coronavirus in nature, outside of the human body, it can be destroyed if it is exposed to household soap, which has its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is closely associated with the early SARS-COV.
The virus is estimated to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically cloned with the Betacronavirus genus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the genus B) together with two gallus of bat offspring.
This virus has 96% in the entire genome level with the other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, researchers in Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the skeletal virus and the human virus.
Up to now, the comparison of the entire genome found at most there are 92% of the genetic similarity between the coronavirus and the SARS-COV-2, not enough to prove that the propelling is the starring between the SARS-COV-2.
Infections by viruses can be diagnosed while on the basis of symptoms, but confirmation in the end is done by reaction of the back transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or to capture CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a large number of flashing features that were in conflict with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-COV-2, which were first distributed on 17 January.
Testing using real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase chain reaction.
Testing may be done on a respiratory or blood sample.
The results are generally available within hours of a few days.
In general, this test is performed on nasopharyng valves, but throat buttons can also be used.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serological tests proved to be accurate enough to approve its extensive use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by a certified laboratory.
Characteristic features X-ray imaging and computed tomography (CT) on people who feelcommunicated include ground glass asymmetrical opacity and no pleura effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Due to a rise in other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in Tiongkok compared breast CT with PCR and showed that although not specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive and is advised to be considered as a bridge in the epidemic area.
The neural network of conceptually-based artificial intelligence has been developed to detect virus imaging features with X-rays and CT.
The strategy to prevent this disease from spreading includes keeping a good personal cleanliness comprehensively, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and using coughing or sneezing tissue and directly throwing the tissue into the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
It is also recommended that the authorities of various regions restrict or call to stop all non-essential journeys to and from countries and regions affected by the plague.
However, the virus has reached a level of public reach in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who deal with people who may be infected are advised to perform standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection actions. Contact tracking is an important step for health authority to determine the sources of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of the location data from the phone by the government for this purpose has triggered privacy issues, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for such surveillance.
Mobile apps have been implemented or proposed to be used on a voluntary basis, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user-wide proximity to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who is tested positive for COVID-19.Concerning the misunderstanding of how to prevent infection; for example, brushing noses and curds with an ineffective peak drug.
There was no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations were working to develop it.
Washing hands is encouraged to prevent disease from spreading.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after making noses, coughs, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that damaged its protective layer.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitization with an alcohol content of at least 60% based on the volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of latents (in one minute the soil is infected for the surface of the carbonate), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, hypochlorite sodium 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other routes, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexide glucone, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed COVID cases in public facilities, such as offices or child care facilities, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic equipment together as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with elbows being held or using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately discard the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and time range of expiratory droplets spreading when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of wearing masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with hands that are not clean enough, which is the primary source of release."Masker also recommended to be used by those who are treating other people who may be suffering from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of COVID-19, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to push masks on members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth. Toongkok specifically recommends the use of medical masks to a healthy society, especially when near (1 m (3 ft) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommended surgical masking when using public transportation or living in widespread areas.
Thai health workers encouraged people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
Czech and Slovak Republics forbid their people to go out in public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they went to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government is forcing everyone who enters the Tosserba to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, requires train passengers and city buses to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama is responsible for the use of face masks every time out of the house, and recommends the production of face masks by itself for those who cannot buy face masks.
Fact masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restraint (also called physical restraint) is an act of controlling the infection that is meant to slow the spread of disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social restraint methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Social restraint methods can be applied by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding public areas, using uncontacted greetings, and maintaining physical distances from others.
At present, many governments are obligated to wipe out social restrictions in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered who were recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations were reduced rapidly, from 250 people (if not known as COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Age and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertensiveness, and immune systems that are at risk of serious illness and higher complications are suggested by the CDC for as much as possible at home as possible in areas with socially ill conditions. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the term "social restraint" as "physical restraint", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, either virtual or from a distance.
The use of the term "social restraint" suggests that people have to isolate themselves completely socially and do not encourage people to keep in touch with others in alternative ways.
This recommendation includes encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Independent isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed to suffer from COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended independent quarantine for all populations living in the affected areas.
The strictest independent quarantine instructions are issued for those who are members of high risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19's disease and those who recently traveled to the country or territory with the widespread COVID-19's widespread use are advised to do quarantine independently for 14 days since the last possible date.
The strategy for disease control is separation or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The treatment was carried out at the early stage of the epidemic and aimed at tracking and isolating infected people and taking other steps to control infections and vaccines that aim to stop the spread of disease throughout the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, the next effort is to shift to a mitigating stage: these steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care and society.
Combination of isolation and mitigation can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive number to less than 1.The purpose of the management of the epidemic epidemic disease is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known to control the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of ill health and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
The intervention of nonfarms to deal with the plague involves the prevention of individual actions, such as hand-cleaning, wearing a mask of face, and independent quarantine; steps at the level of society intended for physical restraint, such as closing schools and abolishing mass meetings; the involvement of the community to encourage reception and participation in this kind of intervention; and steps at the environmental level, such as cleaning the surface.
Other countries also apply various measures aimed at curbing the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduces mass depletion and local quarantine, as well as warning of infected people’s movements.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who are doing quarantine on their own and wearing a big dent for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan's increased production of face masks and punishing medical supplies. Simulation for Britain and the United States showed that mitigation (developing but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have a major challenge.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce health care peaks to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and poor health systems.
The suppression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained during the time the virus remains in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first one achieved), because otherwise, the release will bounce back quickly when the suppressed steps are reduced.
Long-term interventions to suppress pandemics have an impact on social and economics.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing drug testing.
Taking the flu that is sold free, drinking enough water, and rest can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen patient conditions.
Some of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of another virus disease are being investigated for use in COVID treatment-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home affairs" can reduce symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO regional office in Europe have issued primary health and hospital referrals to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, if it is possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive COVID-19 patients, and improve the capacity of intensive care by training personnel and increase the number of ventilators and sleeping rooms.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Janan Sea Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals, or, in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus-like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenulang, were warned by the police for spreading false cults, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by their superiors for warning.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31st and told WHO.
Quite a lot of unknown pneumonia cases are reported to the health authority in Wuhan that then triggers investigation at the beginning of January. At the early stage of the outbreak, the number of cases doubles every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spreads to other provinces of Tiongkok, supported by migration during the Illek New Year's and because Wuhan is the center of transportation and main railway transit.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported almost 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.On March 26, the United States has exceeded Tiongkok and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 have died in the world and over 364,000 have been cured.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
Because of pandemics in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and create border control.

On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a quarantine condition, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world’s population.

The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the transmission from humans to humans.
At the end of January, the Tiongkok government launched a radical campaign that was later explained by the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Tiongkok Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to protect the spread of the virus.

Coronavirus plague was placed on the supply shortage case, which was the result of an increase in the use of equipment globally to combat the plague, the procurement due to panic, and the disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Drug and Food Supervisory Body warns about the lack of drugs and medical equipment because of increasing consumer demand and consumption disorders.
Some areas are also purchased because of panic that leads to a lack of basic needs, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which triggers supply shortages.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the slowdown in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to general director WHO Tedros Adhanom, requests for protection are 100 times higher.
This request led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a delay in medical supplies for four to six months.
It also causes a lack of protective devices around the world, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia, pandemics provide a new opportunity for Daigou merchants to sell Australian products in Tyeongkok.
This led to a lack of milk in several supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government, and beyond the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as a high demand for food products, the two areas were excluded from food shortages.
Tiongkok and Italy's steps in combating the exploitation and illegal trade of products are important so that the anticipated lack of acute food will occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large crop production, has not yet had a significant decline, but the price can rise according to industrial representation.
The empty food racks are only found temporarily, even in the town of Wuhan, along with the government officials of Tiongkok to remove the pigmeat to ensure the health of the community.
Similar ones also exist in Italy, which requires food producers to store backups for such an emergency.
Global economic collapse has occurred in Tyeongkok: According to the media report on March 16, the economy in Tyeongkok was hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of government steps to curb the spread of the virus, and the sale of rites at 20.5%.

The central bank reacted faster than they did when the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severe sectors affected by travel bans, public closures, including travel sites, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights because of few requests, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the sailing industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferries have also been closed down.
Epidemi is in agreement with Chunyun, the main season of travel that relates to the New Illek vacation.
A number of events involving a lot of people were canceled by central government and the region, including annual New Year’s Ilek festival, and private companies are also independently closing shops and places of tourism, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s and tourist events are closed up to prevent mass gatherings, including the banned city of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
From 24 out of 31 provinces, cities, and areas of Tiongkok, authorities extended the New Year’s vacation to 10 February and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are home to 80% of the country's GDP and 90% exports.
Hong Kong increased the spread of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency situation, closed the school until March, and canceled the New Year’s celebrations.
A visit to the cricket in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
The North and Middle American governors experienced 50–60% decline.
This also resulted in 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
It is estimated that the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America will be responsible for increasing the number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America.
In January and February 2020, during the epidemic peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in Tiongkok lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, coronavirus epidemics could cause 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates to reach 32%. Forty-fifty regions in India have caused tens of millions of migrant workers in India (paid through daily wages) unemployed. Surveys of Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada have lost some kind of jobs. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since the quarantine of the region in mid-March 2020.
During the two-month period of March, a total of 4 million French workers filed temporary unemployment payments and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme, and almost half a million German companies submitted short-term work schemes for their employees, Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Around the world, the entertainment industry and cultural heritage are greatly affected by pandemics, which influence organizational and individual operations, both hired and self - employed.
Organizations of the arts and culture sectors strive to uphold their mission (often publicly funded) to give cultural heritage access to society, to safeguard employees and society, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at a different level, museums, libraries, showgrounds, and other cultural institutions are closed indefinitely, with shows, shows, shows, and shows being canceled or postponed.
As a response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The impact of other recent and very rapidly developing diseases is the abolition of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and the entertainment industry.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the Christian baptism of Prapaskah, was cancelled.

Around the world, casinos and other games are closed and live broadcasts poker tournaments are delayed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites to report significant new registration increases, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many large theaters like Broadway are also delaying all shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share works over the Internet as an alternative to a traditional live show, such as live live live live concert or make "festival" web based for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
The Internet is often used as a coronative theme, which is spread over multitudes of people who switch to humor and distracting in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague, it has been observed that there has been a rise in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against the Tionghoa and East Asian descendants, as well as against those from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports of February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Tiongkok) recorded racist sentiment expressed in various groups worldwide that the Tionghoa people deserve to receive viruses or accept things they claim as a reward.
Some countries in Africa have also increased anti-Tiongkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of the origin of their area.
There's been support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for the people in the affected areas.
The outbreak of outbreaks of new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe experiencing serious outbreaks of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia, including the people of the countries of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at the beginning of the petition to ban the people of Tyeonghoa from entering their countries in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag is a Twitter train.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-COV-2 viruses includes methods that detect virus existence and detect produced antibodies as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronary RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-COV-2 viruses only.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibod detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibodies show the number of people who have been infected, including those who have symptoms too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
An accurate mortality rate of disease and the level of mass immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has any basic data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
By March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of tests carried out by countries.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of reported case fatalities, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on throat valves can only be reliable in the first week of illness.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
As an alternative, for infected people tested on the second week, samples can be taken from the deep vents by using a sucking catheter or a cough can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
English Raya also developed a test on January 23, 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerCheck Coronavirus) crisis testing device on January 28, 2020.
This device is a search for "E" gene that has all coronavirus betas, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-COV-2. In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive the emergency use approval from the National Medical Product Administration Tiongkok for the SARS-COV-2-based PCR. In the United States, the Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCOV) to the public health laboratory through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in the old version test results unconvincing because of reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and then state labs and local laboratories are allowed to perform tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Drug and Food Supervisors' Committee based on the U.S. Emergency Authorisation.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on the national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There is no stated quantity limit; collection and processing of specimens should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and VECTOR Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Surveillance Service for Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported developing tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's approval for a 3.5 hour trial with a high volume so that a machine could perform approximately 4,108 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the US Emergency Authorization to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a trial that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using non-PCR isothermal nuclear amplification technology.
Because it does not require a series of temperature replacement cycles, this method can produce positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds new nukleopasid protein (N-protein) coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of producing results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photo-toraks have a small diagnostic value at the early stage, as well as CT findings [computedtomography] may already exist before the event."
Special features on CT include bilateral ground-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetries, and posteriors.
Subpleura dominance, crazi paving, and consolidation formed as the disease develops.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the point of origin of the pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although not specific, with a lot of subtle imaging features lingering with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."On March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for early termination.
Part of the immune response to infection is antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
The automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but its availability depends on the production level for each system.
For CLT, a periphery blood specimen is generally used, although specimens can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, a periphery of blood is generally used through skin bites.
Unlike the PCR method, an extraction step is not required before the inspection. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 institutions that provide notification to agencies as needed and therefore now can distribute their antibodies.
On 7 April 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on the authorization of emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test tools that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
The capacity of testing up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing against RNA viruses.
At the beginning of April, Raya found that none of the antibodies she bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong set up a scheme to allow the expected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a specimen tank," they spit in it, send it back, and get the test results some time later. The British NHS announces that NHS is pioneering the expected case testing scheme at home so that it eliminates the risk of patients entering another person if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect an ambulance if used.
On March 2, the National Association of Statutes Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in street care and 10,700 tests had been carried out the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if tested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, the flooring test was offered in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital develop and test methods to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if the samples were found positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-metre-metre-high-level emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (the Mandarin language , , or "Api" in the Indonesian language) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With construction being monitored by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and taking five days, the model indicates that the Hubei case can be 47% higher and the cost associated with quarantine can be doubled if this test capacity does not exist.
The Wuhan Laboratory immediately followed by the Huo-Yan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities all over Tiongkok.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex designs released by Origami Assays can test a total of 1,222 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be run in the small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid control.
Until March, insufficient resources and sufficient reagents have become obstacles to mass testing in the European Union, the United States, and the United States.
On March 31, the Arab Emirates was reported to perform more coronavirus testing per capita than in any country, and is ready to increase the time of testing for most populations.
This is achieved through the combination of ground-breaking testing and laboratory procurement of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of Tyeongkok.
Test recipes targeting various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for the production of testing devices that were sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until 28 January until it slowed down the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the epidemic, Tiongkok and the United States were troubled by the defects of the test equipment; these two countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet their requests and recommendations for medical testing.
Instead, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in the private sector lab, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the expansion of the testing program as the best way to slow the increase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, Tionkok reported the problem of accuracy on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC have "impaired"; the government then eliminates the obstacle of bureaucracy that prevents private testing. Spanish buys testing tools from the company Tionkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the result is uncertain.
The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of failure in collecting samples or using the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would pull the wrong-looking equipment, and replace it with another test device provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the testing device purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiongkok gives the wrong result. Slovakia buys 1.2 million test tools from the proven Tiongkok.
Minister Matovič suggested that this test tool be discarded in the Danube River. Atheş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said Turkey's "high fault rate" in Turkey and they don't "use it".Ingris Raya bought 3.5 million test tools from Tyeongkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine, positive testing and tracking of people contacting positive SARS-COV-2, gives a positive final result.
A researcher working in the city of Vò Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of tests in the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people have no symptoms, and all the cases found are quarantined.
With the restriction of travel to this community, new infections were eliminated at all.
With aggressive contact tracking, inlet restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other advanced countries, even without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of restaurants and ritual companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened right after their vacation on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics by tracking aggressive contact, preventing entry, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine areas that are less aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower fatality rate, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples COVID-19 first and ten negative samples first to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 references, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "positive test results" column was influenced by the country's policy of testing.
A country that only tests those treated in the hospital will have % higher positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factor.
Washing hands, which is also called by the cleanliness of the hands, is the act of cleansing the hands of someone who is intent on eliminating dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently on certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, that are transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People may also be exposed to respiratory disease, such as influenza or spleen, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membrane).
Five critical days to wash your hands with soap are: before and after a big shower, after cleaning your asses or changing your diapers, before feeding your children, before eating and before and after preparing food or eating meat, fish, or raw nails.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization suggests washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has just used a toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, eating animals, or shitting animals.
The cleanliness of the medical hand refers to the practice of cleaning that relates to medical procedure.
Washing your hands before giving medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce disease preaching.
The main medical objective of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
and reduce infant mortality rates at home.
Studies carried out in 2013 show that practical improvements in washing hands can slightly increase the growth of children.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate as a result of the disease to almost 50%.
An encouraging handwashing intervention can reduce diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of cases of diarrhea can be associated with soap-based handwashing. Washing hands with soap is the only way that is most effective and affordable to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infection (ISPA) as a subconscious behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one child death; this disease causes death of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diaries and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and using toilets as an established habit can save more lives than vaccines or medical actions, and reduce death due to diarrhea to almost half and death due to acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water program, sanitation, and cleaning (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from the impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
The minor side effect of washing hands is the washing of hands that is often done can cause skin damage as a result of skin drying.
Study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that washing hands excessively can cause the skin conditions of the skin and the skin, known as the extreme hand or dermatism of the hand, which is especially occurring among health workers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important in order to reduce the spread of the disease by fecal means: before and after using the toilet, after cleaning the asses of the child, before feeding the child, before eating and before eating or eating meat, fish, or raw nails.
Another important time to apply proper handwashing technique to prevent the transmission of disease is before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal shit or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, washing levels with soap are still low.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest levels of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the lowest level by 23 percent. There are now some methods of behavioural change to improve the adoption of behavior by washing hands with soap at critical times. Washing hands grouped for students at specified times is one of the options in the developing countries to accommodate handwash in children's behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program, implemented by the Education Department in the Philippines, is an example of timely action to support the health and education of children.
The donation of worms twice a year, plus by washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
This program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleansing of the skin is reinforced by soap supplementing or detergent into water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to traffic and to increase the power of the late.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, not easily flowing in water.
At such times, adequate water supply helps to clean fat and protein.
Solid soap, because of its re-use character, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies investigating the transfer of bacteria from densely contaminated soap have concluded that the transfer could not be possible because of the bacterium that is so thin with the foam.
Nevertheless, the CDC still states "the liquid soap that leaves the container without touching the hands is more popular."
The antibacterial soap is highly beneficial to people who are conscious of health.
Until now, there has been no evidence that antiseptic or disinfection use is recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains general antibacterial agents such as truclosan, which has a list of vastly maintained foreign organisms.
So, even if a strain that holds antibiotics is not targeted by antibacterial soap, it may not be as effective as it is.
A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon Public Health Facultation shows that ordinary soap is as effective as a consumer antibacterial soap containing trichosin in preventing disease and purifying bacteria from hands.
Comfortable hot water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot water is more effective than cold water in eliminating natural oil that holds dirt and bacteria.
However, in response to the belief of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand service or antiseptic hand is a clean, waterless agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand-cleaning agent of a non-water-based alcohol gutter (also known as an alcohol-based handcuff, antiseptic handcuff, or hand-cleaning) began to be known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that is formulated along with the ingredients of the carbomer (polymer acid acrylic) into gels or with humektans such as glyserin into fluid or foam for easy use and to reduce the dry effects of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide incer enhances further antimicrobial activity. The hand care that contains at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Fungal alcohol healing kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol service that contains 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5, similar to reduction 35 decibels) in hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hands 1 minute after use. The most effective hand care for bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand care is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics of alcohol in sufficient quantities should be used to treat or cover two hands in full.
The front and back of two hands and the end of all fingers is rubbed about 30 seconds until fluid, foam, or dry gel.
The fingertips should also be washed well by rubbing them on two hands. The Center for Control and Prevention of US Diseases is more likely to recommend handwashing instead of the tinnitus of the hands, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increases the use of sanitization agents due to the ease of use and rapid killing activities against microorganisms; however, it should not be used as a correct handwash replacement, unless soap and water are not available.
The treatment of alcohol-based hands can often result in dry skin, except when emolyen and/or skin-stamps are added to the formula.
Drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glyserin and/or other emoliens to the formula.
In clinical trials, blood transfusions with alcohol containing emolinics cause irritation and skin irritation far lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in the handcuff of alcohol rarely occurs.
Lower tendencies cause contact dermatitis to interfere with the appeal of this product rather than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not clean hands from organic matter, but only disinfect it.
For this reason, the cleaning of hands is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still in hand.
The honesty of the free - alcohol healing depends heavily on the materials and formulations, and according to history, this product has significantly worsene than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, the formulation that uses benzalkonium klorida has been proven to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which is proved to be less successful after repeated use, possibly due to a progressive side effect reaction.
Many in the low - income community are unable to buy soap and use ashes or soil as a substitute.
Abu or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ashes are also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ashes will form alkaline slurry.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative soap when soap is not available.
The technique to wash the right hands based on the recommendation US Disease Control Center for prevention of disease include the following steps:
Put your hands on the hot or cold water that flows.
Water flows recommended because frozen baskom may be contaminated, while water temperatures seem to have no effect.
Tear your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including your back, in your fingernails, and under your nails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more accurately when using soap than when using water.
Gosok for at least 20 seconds.
Ripping creates cracks, which help remove germs from the skin, and scrubs longer to remove more germs.
Speak accurately under the running water.
Swelling in a basketball can get your hands back contaminated.
Dry with a dry blanket or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and wet feet are easier to recontaminate, the area that is often crossed is thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under nails.
Artificial nails and missing nails can keep microorganisms.
Severe lotions are often recommended to keep your hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Low-paid options can be made to facilitate washing hands when water and/or soap are not available, for example, flowing water from the potholes or bottles hanged and covered and/or using ashes, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in the developing country), there are water-heating solutions, such as "typpy-tap", and other low-paid options.
Because tippy is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hanging with ropes, a towel operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a piece of soap.
Effective hand removal is an important part of the process of cleaning hands, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand drying in the public toilet.
More and more research shows that paper roofs are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study carried out by Westminster University, London, and available by the European Tissue Symposium paper pulp industry, to compare the level of paper cleaning, warm air hand drying, and more moderate jet air handling.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the finger books and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Disgruntled with jet air dryers caused a rise in the total amount of the average 42% bacteria in the finger books and 15% on the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palm of the hand.The scientists also did tests to determine the potential of cross-contamination on the other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which drains air from the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can blow microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially defile other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 m.
The use of a warm air-drying hand spreads microorganisms up to .25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various hand-drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, changes in the number of bacteria observed:
There are many hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper sheets.
Washing hands using hand-hungry tissue is an alternative for travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand service should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The washing of medical hands was required far after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreases with the use of the device.
The washing of medical hands is done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large number of or gels to make up and rub every part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with fingers attached to each other.
If there's dirt under the nails, the fur scars can be used to remove it.
Since the germ can survive in the water in the hands, the hand needs to be thoroughly embellished and dried with a clean lip.
Once dry, paper sheets are used to turn off the water sheet (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids the recontamination of the hands from the surface.
The goal of washing hands in health care settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("same") and avoid their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hands is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient and transmitting microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood flow related to catheters up to 66 percent.
The WHO concept of hand cleaning can also be seen on its website for public comment.
The relevant review by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand-cleaning if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has "Lima Tempo" to wash hands:
after exposed to blood/body fluid
before aseptic task, and
after the patient treatment. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (the "pharmaceutical" or "antimicrobial" soap) serves to kill handwash.
The killing function may be desired before surgery or in situations where an antibiotic-holding organism is very common. To rub hands before the surgery, it may be necessary to heat and turn off without touch, to wash chlorhexide or yodium, sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and sterile scars to rub up and other sterile instruments to clean under nails.
All the jewelry has to be released.
This procedure means washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
A long (10 minutes) snail time is not required.
When boiling, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
Once the hands are washed, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the scalp is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, wash your hands or use hand sanitization before and after handling sick people.
For staphylococcal infection control in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the first 20% wash, and that the additional benefit obtained is very little when the hand cleaning frequency is increased above 35%.
The washing of soap causes more than three times the spread of infection to food than the washing of antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handcuffs to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spore difficult from the hand. Interventions to improve hand-cleaning in health care settings can involve education for staff about washing hands, increasing availability of alcohol-based handcuffs, and written reminders and licensing to staff.
More research is needed to know the most effective intervention in various settings of health care.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents’ homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, although there is an option to make a cheap washing site.
In any case, the low rate of washing of hands may also occur because of a habit that has been planted rather than because of a lack of soap or water.
The desire and encouragement to wash hands with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and lead to changes in behavior of the long - term population.
In order to run effectively, monitoring and evaluation is required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that an effective community approach to improving the handwash in the LMIC, while less effective social marketing campaigns. One example of handwashing at school is "Third Approach" by UNICEF that encourages school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that the students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the school can move from one star to three.
Building a washbasin can be part of the handwashing campaign to reduce the disease and the death of children.
The World’s Washing Hands is another example of an awareness-building campaign that seeks to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-2020 virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages handwashing emoji.
Some studies examine the cost-effectiveness of washing hands globally in developing countries in connection with the prevention of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year that has been lost as a result of illness.
One survey showed that encouraging washing hands with soap is significantly more expensive than water intervention and other sanitation.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as the newly born mother or the wounded in the hospital, was first known in the mid-19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the guardian of modern care" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection is caused by the rotten smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, disease spread through food and infections related to health care made the Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active inciting the hygiene of the hands as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
Pig flu epidemics in 2009 and COVID-19 pandemics in 2020 increased awareness in many countries would be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from such a contagious disease.
For example, the poster "technological washing the right hand" hung next to the washbasin in the public toilet and in the toilet of the office and airport in Germany.
The expression "cleaning hands from" means that someone's reluctance to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
This expression comes from the Bible chapter in Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to have Jesus Christ baptized, but it has become a widely used expression in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands constantly to clean up the imaginary stain; an act that showed her guilt for the crime she did and for having persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been known that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to value hand washing equipment more highly.
Further, those who are left to wash their hands after such meditation have a smaller likelihood of being involved in a "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanness and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is the ritual of washing hands in many religions, including the faith of the Bahá'í, the Hindus, the jadayim, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions are obliged to wash their hands after using toilets.
Furthermore, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam require a washing of their hands before and after eating.
Risk control at work for COVID-19
Hazard control for COVID-19 is a safety and safety methodology application for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate hazard control at work depends on the location of work and work, which is based on risk assessment of the sources of disease, disease levels in society, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to VOCID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk employment has minimal contact with the public and other partners; for this work, it encourages basic infection prevention measures, including washing hands, pushing workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics, and doing regular cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Work at risk is involving work that requires close contact or often with people who are not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by the transmission of an international society or travel.
These groups include workers who have contact with public communities such as in schools, working environments with high population fats, and high volume ritual settings.
Risk control for this group, in addition to steps to prevent basic infection, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filter, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health and the body rooms exposed to known or suspected to suffer from high-risk COVID-19, which increases the risk of high-risk exposure if workers perform aerosol treatment procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Hazard control appropriate for this worker includes technical control, such as negative pressure ventilating room, and self-protection device that fits the job.
COVID-19 disease can have some impact at work.
Workers may not come to work because of sickness, the need to take care of others, or because of fear of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, either in the type of goods requested or in the way they obtain these items (such as shopping outside the busy hours, through delivery, or raising).
Eventually, shipments of goods from a highly affected geographical area of COVID-19 could be disrupted, with an accident and an infection relief plan being used to guide the action of protection.
The plan considers the risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, including sources of exposure, risks arising from household and society settings, and risks to each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also describes the control required to address the risk and the emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Annoyance and plans for the spread of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the outbreak is to reduce the spread between staff, to protect people at higher risk for poor health complications, to maintain business operations, and to minimize the bad effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where business is affecting the action taken.
The hierarchy of hazard control is a work force used in safety and health work to decompose hazard control based on its effectiveness.
If the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative investigation, and the last protective device.
Technical supervision involves insulating employees from work-related dangers without relying on employee behavior and can be the most expensive solution to apply.
Administrative supervision is a change in the policy or procedure of the work to be performed by a worker or a worker.
Self-protection tools (PADs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of ODA should be selected based on hazard to workers, properly installed as they do (e.g., respirators), consistently and correctly applied, checked, treated, and occasionally replaced, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and properly kept or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk employment has minimal contact with the public and other workers.
The recommended basic infection prevention steps for all workplaces include often washing hands thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay in the home if the disease, the ethics of breathing includes covering cough and sneezing, providing the tissue and trash, preparing work from a distance or shift of work with a time of arrival/supply, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and routinely cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
A quick identification and isolation of the potential person is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever-lowering drug or other symptoms-changer, and that sick leave policy be flexible so that they allow employees to stay at home to take care of sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, risky work is involving work that requires close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) of unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of public flows around business locations, or because someone has recently made an international trip to the location with widespread COVID-19 transmissions.
This group includes workers who have contact with public citizens such as school, work environment with high population, and high-volume rituals. Technical supervision for this group and high-risk groups includes installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, physically stimulating such as synchronizing plastics, and installing non-essential devices to the location of the COVID-19 disease, developing high-risk communication plans to address workers' interests, equipping workers with a face-to-face encounter with virtual communication, making work shifts with the arrival/stopping point, halting non-essential travel to the location of the COVID-19 disease, developing emergency communications plans for the forum to respond to workers' needs, equip workers with education and training on the risk of COVID-19 and changing skills, training staff who need to use the customary skills and skills skills, and training them to use the skills and skills they need to use the skills and skills they need to perform, to respond to the needs of the worker, and to prepare the needs of the environment, and to adapt the environment to the environment and to adapt the environment.
Workers in these risk groups rarely need a respirator.
If someone falls ill on a plane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick from others by 6 feet, pointing out one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering face masks for the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Your cabin should wear a medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or touching a contaminated body or surface fluid and possibly other protective devices if a sick passenger suffers from fever, coughing continuously, or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other items must be thrown into a life-threatening bag, and the contaminated surface must be cleaned and disinfected after it.
Ideally, medical further action is being done in the isolated people's cabins, beyond public preaching, for children's school and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is an influx in society at the minimum to the present, social restraint strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between the table, the time of arrival and a gradual return, restricting non-essential visitors, and using separate medical locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high level of delivery in local society, in addition to social exclusion strategies, the extension of school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the risk of direct health risk is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is advised to follow the same advice as the emergency medical technician, including using appropriate self-protection devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and equipment prior to re-use by using sprays or household cleaners and follow standard operating procedures to control and discard old APDs and to control and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers the health and the particular morgue to be at high risk or very high risk.
Work at high risk includes health care, support, labs, and medical transportation energy that is exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work is at a very high risk if workers do aerosol procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, known or suspected COVID-19.
The aerosol procedure involves intubation, cough induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimens.
The work of the high-risk morgue includes the workers involved in preparing the known or suspected COVID-19 case at death; this work is at very high risk if the workers do the autopsy. Additional technical control for this risk group includes the isolation room for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when the aerosol procedure is done.
Ventilation of special negative pressure may be appropriate in some settings of health care and morgue.
The specimen must be handled by the biological safety level prevention action 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to separate into a different waiting room depending on whether they are suspected of a COVID-19 case. In addition to other APD, OSHA recommends a respirator for those who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-COV-2, and those who perform aerosol control procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter-respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive respiratory protection programs that include conformity tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers. WHO does not recommend closed clothes entirely or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted through body fluid.
WHO only recommended a surgical mask for screening officers at the entry point.
For those who take breath specimens, care for, or carry COVID-19 patients without aerosol delivery procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves.
If aerosols are administered, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Considering that APD supplies are not enough around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the needs of APD through long-range medical care, physical limitations such as window-to-look, with only those involved in direct care may enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, use only the necessary APD for certain tasks, continue to use the same respirator without releasing while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and organizing the APD supply chain, and does not push mask use for people without symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covid-19] lightens the load and prepares the future
TRANSPORTATION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LINES: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in a situation that this month was unique.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a thing that makes clear the global human bond and the responsibility that we have for each other.
We've never had a challenge before, but we know that our best response depends on the empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care that we have witnessed among all the colleagues through email, phone calls, and conversation is an extraordinary validation of the incredible human being, which we are lucky enough to work with them.
Thank you and my pride are inexhaustible to call you a fellow worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful this is a symbol for this important resource to keep available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, either you make sure this site stays running, help pay our partners, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs information that Wikipedia has, especially now.
This is a moment when it's not just the work we do, but the way we do it will make a significant impact to the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization alive during this time.
We really want to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to cut down on the job schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted today, and either you need to care for the loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This shouldn't have to be said, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO is not necessary, just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main fields of work can be completed.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T&C Ops that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management.)
His full-time fellows will be paid.
We've said it, and we've said it again, to respect our commitment to our contractors and staff based hours.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours when conditions are normal.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to channel stress against the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in these times.
Again, the main thing is to look after yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and the Dane Development Team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to assess the current goal and distract our focus from supporting the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down now will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan on working late after this pandemic passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet an unrealistic timescale at this time.
We realize that situations change and will try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of the day’s work hours, we wanted to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We mean to propose the extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so that employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care of the loved ones while adapting their needs or wanting to work on less schedule over the next few weeks.
The length of this timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressures throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, billboards, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF may have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired the anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surface sites in the San Francisco office.
They use antiviral hospital fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floor.
The building's applying the protocol to its own safety by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We were happy that the office would be ready to be used when we decided to come back.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, who has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members based on DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a long-distance, long-distance job, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our core partners in NYC know, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
The discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked from a distance for the first time.
Our long-working colleagues realize that this may require adjustments and they want to offer advice to you:
The maximum duration limit of a meeting is one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how it will be divided into a few days.
Define a meeting clearly, make a schedule, and send out previous publications.
Make video a default, with a tool like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Lead signs to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help create a meeting record (or make a collaborative record).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small food.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to a partner about the shared work
The SDM Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the recipients to take the community to cancel a public event that was funded by Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic was over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to settle the agreed conduct and that no one would be given the foundation because they had to delay or modify the target.
Next week we will continue with additional guidance on Wikipedia and regional community conferences and other topics.
Generally speaking, sentiment from all over the global community seems to be a sadness over this disorder, but it is both comforting to see the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, whether it is Wikimedia or any other.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can keep getting information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the main course of work, or the difficulty with the contours, or other things that may need help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become a linker as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please email Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations SDM.
There is no such change seen as the completion of our work and our obligation.
On the other hand, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and obligation may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are essential to supporting each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide support for our movements, and give the world the service they want.
The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create a space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and members of the other leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activities opposite the enzyme angiotensin (ACE), reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for some coronary agents.
ACE2 human version often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 reversal enzyme is a metaloenzym that contains latch on the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has domain M2 peptide terminal-N and domain transporter amino acid renal colectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single-pearl type I membrane protein, with an active domain enzymatically embedded on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extrasal domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, which is known as sheddase, and the resulting latent protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially lung cells type II, small-use enterosis, endotel arteries and veins, and polos artery muscle cells in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
ACE2's main function is as a balance-up ACE.
ACE divides angiotensin hormone I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut amino phenylalanine terminal phenylalanine acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis became angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikin, apple, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the traffic of membranes transporting amino neutral acid SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the main entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the treatment of S1 protein on the spikes or densities SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 with an enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of the cell leads to endositosis and transfer of viruses and enzymes into the endosome in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires S-protein priming by TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesis that lowering ACE2's levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a decrease of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also linked to the decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 humancombination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and apparently increases pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation on a pig with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplysakarida.
The amount of time rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute shift besides its 24-hour long effect.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin (RAS inhibitor) inhibitors or on angiotensin II disease in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome treatment.
b'Application COVID-19 is a mobile phone software application designed to help tracking contacts to recapture the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying the "count" people who may have made contact with infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which receive official government support in a number of areas and jurisdictions.
Some jobs to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questioned, especially in relation to the system based on tracking the user’s geographical location of the application.
Alternatives that don't involve too much privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth based applications directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, the Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has been distributing applications that allow citizens to check for contacts with COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in more than 200 cities of Tiongkok. In Singapore, it is used as TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be delivered to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track claims against potentially infected people and provide rapid response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was currently in progress and would be available to spread within a few weeks. Such an application was planned in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for the diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur in the application-based system, which includes false positives and the possibility of being less effective if the data taken limited application in only a small part of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add a coronavirus related application to App Store, which is limited only to "resemi" organization or which has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates express their concern about the massive monitoring implications of using coronavirus applications, especially whether the monitoring infrastructure that is made to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations make statements calling for limitations on this kind of surveillance.
This organization provides eight conditions for the government project:
surveillance must be "according to law, need, and proportionate";
the need for monitoring and monitoring must have sunset sunk;
data use must be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid the more severe discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with the third party must be defined in laws;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The participation of all "my relevant interests" is necessary, which includes community health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to deal with ongoing monitoring issues by removing tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after no longer required.
Some countries use network - based tracking, not applications, to eliminate the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network - based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potential significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with core servers need to access personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been created and use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes celler tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notification through text messages to someone with the potential for infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted with a wide change in the privacy laws after the launch of the MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Such countries as Germany consider using the most central system and a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been published.
Contact tracking for privacy is a concept that has already been mapped, with a large number of literary research starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to other phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort that contains a focus and decentralised approach, not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes a closer detection of the Protection of Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously referred to as the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and the Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Cellular Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all matchings occur in the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protective techniques when collecting and using the location or data intersect run to track COVID-19.
This is based on a study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released on March 2020. Another similar project was the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally set up at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, Global TCN co-operation was established by groups with the same approach and was a multiple-fold protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which was a key aspect of reaching a broad reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications an open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of low energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also publish the specification of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
Launch of the tool to allow government to make official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
The integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to address data collection and monitoring issues continuously with the beginning of distributing the system through the update of the operating system, and then deleting it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition of drugs (also known as a new purpose gift, a new profile, or a new drug assignment or a combination of therapies).
This course is a scientific research course that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
The direction of another study includes the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfusion of Convalesen plasma. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several ligan treatment sites.
Analysis of these sites can be the basis for an effective antiviral drug development project for COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-COV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA dependent polymerase-RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofase.
Hussein A A, et al researched some of the candidate's compounds that were later optimized and analyzed the similarity of the population with the drug that had been approved and had the highest levels of nutrition in order to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential drugs in his practical studies to be recommended in clinical design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial drug also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorokuin and related hydrochlorokuin were two of the four drugs to be studied as part of the clinical trial of Solidaritas.
Governor New York, Andrew Cômo, announced that the test of chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin in New York will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of sulphate hydroxychlorokuin and phosphate chlorokuin based on the U.S. Emergency Authorities.
This treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA clinical trial and US-based permission as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients treated inap, but cannot accept treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or hydroxychlorokuin duration for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-COV-2" infection has not been established.
The doctor says they used that drug when "there's no other choice."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study of the use of chlorokuin combined with latch, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are currently being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and safety test of the use of hydroxychlorokuin preventive.
The Tiongkok clinical test in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "effectively clear".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negatively in median 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days on the 45 patients who did not accept the drug.
In a study done in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received humifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Body reminds the public that there is evidence to support the drug in a small and early way.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to send drugs to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to Trump's government about the purchase of this drug, which may be less effective in the case of a disease that is heavy with a multiplication virus.
This medicine may not be safe if used by pregnant mothers or those who try to contain.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no observed benefits".
This drug is designed to prevent HIV replication by binding protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will be related to the SARS-COV-2 protease.There is a criticism in the scientific society of resource reporting to position a drug that is developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO inserted lopinavir/ritonavir into the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection, and then Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several threads, pneumus, paramiso, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some early studies of praupes showed that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.
There are three clinical trials under way for intravenous C vitamins for patients treated with inap and severe COVID-19, two controlled plasebos (Tyeongkok, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotics of azitromisin on March 24, 2020.
Japanese National Center of Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning clinical trials for Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, corticosteroid inhalation for asthma, for treatment of new presymtomatic coronavirus infection patients.
For a form of an enzyme anti-angiotensin 2, Phase II test is ongoing with 200 patients will be recruited from a severe case that is treated inap in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to know the effectiveness of treatment.
Research at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada is currently examining the role of the collective in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, which was called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms so that there was no need for incapacitating.
Women who are pregnant or are pregnant or are not using effective methods of contraception do not qualify.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular cores is often used to treat patients and motivates the Italian Medicine Body to publish guidelines on their use.
A multi-centered study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoksaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving the purpose of new treatment to the approved antivirus and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Tiongkok’s 7th edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Tiongkok’s 7th edition
Some antibiotics identified as potential drugs that can be given a new purpose for COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by Tiongkok.
In addition, tests were also carried out in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed the clinical test, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-COV-2, the epitome virus of this disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in phase I security studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great plague spread worldwide in 2020, which led to major research and investment to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the published genome to develop vaccines that may be able to resist SARS-COV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that what should be noted in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution on the required scale, as well as global access.
In April, ECPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
Target main platform advanced to phase I security study, including:
nuclear acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I development and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with little public information available (reputed to be in planning or planning).
Trial phase I-II tests the initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, controlled on the plasebo, and in some locations, while determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and test vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 currently active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 are not yet in the human evaluation (even in the "praclinis" study).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular graft vaccines that would genetically modify virus proteins to stimulate immune reactions.

Another ECI investment partner for COVID-19 vaccine development is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun testing six vaccine candidates for animals.
Imperial College London research announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing RNA vaccines that can build up themselves for COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from Tiongkok.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a C$275 million funding for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million special funding to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to build a national "vaccine bank" containing some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus plague occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Faculty reported PittCoVacc, candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, on rats; they stated that "MNA who gave S1 SARS-COV-2 subunit vaccine caused a potential antibodies specific response [to mice] that began to appear 2 weeks after immunisation."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy Facultas announces DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriofag, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce non-dangerous similar particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterolog effects, also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond its preventable disease.
Learn more about Australia’s efforts to follow 4,170 health - care officers.
There are possible vaccines in development that are unsafe or effective.
Early research to assess the honesty of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-humanist primates, shows the need for safe steps to reach biological level 3 in handling life viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on the model of non-human animals.
Until 2020, no drug or protective vaccine for SARS has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world, and there is also a proven vaccine for MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, a credible SARS research can be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-COV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical tests on humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, which were all virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media outlets raised conspiracy theories that claim viruses behind COVID-19 have been known before and that vaccines have been available.
The patents quoted by social media sites refer to patents available for genetic sequencers and vaccines for another coronavirus gallor, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Public symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory failure.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from sunrise to evenings is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have resulted in mild symptoms, some have developed into virus pneumonia and failed mastic organ.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, which have resulted in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and this virus is mainly spread across human beings when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced by cough, sneezing, or talking.
Although it was produced when breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not become contagious to a distance.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can survive up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the warning of the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The method of standard diagnosis is with the reaction of the actual-time back transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyng modep.
The use of masks is encouraged for people who are expected to be infected with viruses and those who treat them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different generals; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO areas.
A person who is infected with the virus can be without symptoms or symptoms such as colds, fevers, coughs, fatigue, and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, pain or assortment in the chests, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips of the eye; medical treatment is advised immediately if these symptoms appear.
Higher respiratory symptoms, such as sneeze, constipation, or throat disease, can be found, but more rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in a variety of percentages.
Some cases in Tiongkok were initially only with a clinical description of the chest ass and palpitation.
In some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the body, and death.
These are called incubation times.
The time of incubation for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the people who are fasting will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection, reports that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of the carrier without these symptoms is not fully known; however, the early evidence shows that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and being studied, with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) report that 20% of all confirmed cases remain unreported while being treated in the hospital.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show signs at the time of testing.
Sputum and wastewater can carry a virus load on a large scale.
Talking out releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that unsurfaced cough can cause droplets to grow up to ten feet [4.5 m].
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through air, the United States National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air-breathing placed in the hallways outside the room produces positive samples for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can make the secret of breathing turn into aerosols and spread through air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The European Disease Control and Prevention Center (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cards, up to three days on plastics (polypropylen) and armor (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products describe the fat layer of virus protection, activate the virus, and release it from the skin and the other surface.
Other routes, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexide glucone, are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of saliva were taken in a median of two days after treatment was started inap.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patients showed the highest virus load in the second day's testing.
Koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute breathing syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a class of acute breathing disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-COV-2 virus characteristics exist in the coronavirus that's related to nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by home soap, which damaged its protective bubbles.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the inhaler cell through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, the most abundant in alveolar cell type II lung.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or spice" to connect to ACE2 and enter the swimming cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of the infected people who were treated in pain in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute miocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and involved in cardiac function.
Thrombosis (31%) and vena thromboembolism (25%) were found high in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be related to a bad prognosis. Autopsies on people who died because of VOCID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and infiltration inflammation containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epithel nerve cells that express ACE2, patient COVID-19 weight has systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, the T-cell that secretes the pathogen GM-CSF has been correlated with a monosite contract that secretes the IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphostic infiltration was also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
Standard testing method is real-time transcription polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on breath samples obtained by means of the nasopharynx; however, it can also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires two samples of blood taken within two weeks so that results have a small time value.
Tiongkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus gallor and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibiotic test (which can detect active infection and if someone has previously been infected) is developing, but not used much.
Tiongkok’s experience with the test showed that he was only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnosis guidance issued by the University of Wuhan’s Shand Hospital suggests methods to detect infections based on clinical descriptions and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral ground-glass opacity with periphery, asymmetrical distribution, and later many found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, cry paving (lobular septum pay with variable alveolar loading), and consolidation can occur as a result of disease development.
A little data is available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on the autopsy are:
Makroscopies: pleurization, pervirditis, breast consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of disease virus pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumositis hyperplasia, large atypical pneumositis, interstisial inflammation with lymphosytic infiltration, and giant cell formations are numerous
heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exude.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the recovery stage: soiling soils of alveolar rorgas and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation disseminated (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Steps prevention to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending the use of the inner part of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene appropriate hands after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends that the use of the front cover of cloth in public places, partly to restrict the transmission of people without symptoms. The social restraint strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many, by means of closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
Restrictions also include keeping people at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters in length.
There is no known effective drug preventing COVID-19. Because vaccines are not anticipated until the beginning of 2021, the main part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as "dealing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after the nose, cough, or sneezing.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based sanitization that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitization is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate spores of bacteria in alcohol; this substance is "not active for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol added as humectan.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends those who suspect they're carrying a virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorpore membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still considered.
Cleanness and lifestyle as well as dietary patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for people who have mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Tiongkok National Health Commission have published recommendations for handling COVID-19 patients treated inap.
Intensive nurses and lungists in the United States have put together recommendations for treatment from various agencies to be a free resource, i.e. the IBCC.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical forces recommend more parasetamols (astaminofens) than ibuprofen for the first line use.
Prevention should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of viruses, especially in health care settings when doing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health care force of the COVID-19 disease, CDC recommended placing the person in the Tular-Udara Infection Area (IIR) other than using standard prevention, contact prevention, and custody action. CDC outlined guidelines for the use of self-protection devices (ADD) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD coat, respiratory cap or face mask, eye protector, and medical gloves. If available, a better respiratory cap.
The N95 breather is approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used by the U.S. Emergency Authorisation.
The N95 breather is designed to protect from airborne particles like dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not listed on the label.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last resort, made masks.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until it requires mechanical ventilation or alternative, but some of the cases are heavy.
The type of respiratory support for those experiencing COVID-19's related respiratory failure is currently being studied for those treated inap, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided by high-flowing nasal fluoride or bipositive air supply pressure.
Whether one of these methods results in the same benefit for those with severe illness is not known.
Some doctors prefer to keep on using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds, which limit the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden number of cases of COVID-19 that are quite severe so require care inap.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% enter intensive care units, 2.3% require mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were treated are finally entering the ICU.
Mechanic ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator capable of performing high pressure control and PEEP mode is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilatory related pneumothoraks.
High PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
Research on the potential for treatment started in January 2020 and some anti-virus drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for another use or have been in further testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried on people with severe disease.
The volunteers who are recommended to WHO are also in testing the effectiveness and security of potential treatment. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the equivalent plasma as an experimental treatment in the case of someone's life.
Plasma Convalesen has not undergone the clinical studies needed to prove its safety and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Tingkok launched a mobile app to deal with this disease.
The user was asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect potential risks of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, the application not only recommends independent quarantine, but also tells local health officials about cell data, face detection technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track infected people and those with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel allowed a security body to track the data of the suspected coronary cell phone.
That step is taken to treat quarantine and protect people who may be exposed to infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed telephone location data to the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to examine and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Regional Health Commissioner Italy, Giulio Gallera, said he was told a mobile operator that "40% of citizens are still moving around."
The German government hacked in 48 hours at the end of the week with over 42,000 participants.
Also, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for a creative solution against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience quarantine pressure, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Raising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic loss is a perfect storm that endangers mental health and the well-being of society."
This disease can last mildly or without symptoms, which resemble other general upper respiratory disease, such as pills.
The mild case usually heals within two weeks, while those with severe or severe illness may need three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for a heavy COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of mastic organs.
A complicity related to COVID-19 includes aspsis, abnormal blood count, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood disorders, especially increases in prothrombin time, are observed in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19, while renal dysfunction is seen in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 image showed an increase in heart enzyme (transamine).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in in in-patient care.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have an average of seven days between insanity and death.
In a study that examines early cases, the median time from the early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have 2.8% deaths, while women have 1.7% deaths.
Postmortem lung sample histopathology tests showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyksoid exuds in both lungs.
Siteopathic changes observed on pneumositis.
Artifact images resemble acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of Tiongkok, observed heart damage, with an increase in troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data of the United States, 89% of those treated in the innate have their own condition, and the availability of medical and social economic resources in some areas can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary because of the region’s differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Less counting cases can cause death rates to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean that the mortality rate is now too low.
It's probably 1.4 times as big as a severe COVID-19 symptom, and about 2.4 times as likely to require intensive care or death from non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from disease, and lung scan showed organ damage.
This can also cause post-care-intensive syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity to those who recovered from this disease.
Immunity may be perceived, if you see other coronavirus behaviors, but it has been reported that there is a case of curating COVID-19 that was followed by positive coronavirus tests several days later.
The case is believed to be the remainder of the infection that gets worse, and not re-infection.
This virus is suspected of being natural and coming from animals, through widespread infections.
The truth is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study of 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which was published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of an event is December 1, 2019.
The official WHO publication reported the earliest record update on December 8, 2019.
In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This figure varies according to the region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first plague, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO set an ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death as a result of SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed as laboratory and U07.2 for death as a result of COVID-19 which is clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory confirmation for SARS-COV-2 infection. The ratio of death against the case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a specified period of time.
According to University of Johns Hopkins, the overall ratio of death to the case was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) for 17 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Another measure includes the fatality of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died from certain diseases, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFRs), which reflects the percentage of those who were infected (diagnosis and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
The statistics are time-bound and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the existence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the outbreak of an outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all of COVID-19's deaths are classified as COVID-19's death.
In addition, the German health system has not yet been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as evidenced by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) in fever died of COVID-19.
The effect of pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher for men in studies done in Tingkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a risk between men and new women not appearing at the age of 90.
In Tiongkok, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for this gender-based difference is unknown, but genetic and behavior factors may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger ages than women can contribute to higher male mortality.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% of the people who died because of COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers with a higher gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of developing a virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
Leader WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for first identified outbreak: December 31, 2019.
It is selected to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. Tyeongkok), animal species, or a group of people, along with an international recommendation for marketing that aims to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 is named coronavirus heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also used "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communication.
Neither disease nor the virus is referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Tionkok, virus and this disease is referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and Acute 2019-nCov Breath Disease as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to guidelines 2015 that demand not to use the location name in the name of disease and virus.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as napkins and ventilators components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital really needs a ventilator valve, and the supplier cannot give on the required time scale, a local company is staggered and printed 100 valves needed in the night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 plague, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information on origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of replication of viruses in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effects of four new anti-virus drugs that have been with the most promising honesty.
Vaccines are not available yet, but various agencies are active in developing vaccine candidates.
Previous investigation of SARS-COV was used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 were using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being studied.
First, researchers aim to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, either inactivated or dead, is intended to rapidly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is designed to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine ( DNA vaccine or RNA, a new technique for vaccination).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes that are copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the increase in the number of antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven trials tried to evaluate treatment that had been approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychlorokuin or chlorokuin.
Antiviral drugs given a new purpose form a major part of Tyeongkok’s research, with nine Phase III trials at remdesivir in some countries with a deadline of reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drug was in place.Some of the antiviral drugs that are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, are combined with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for redesivir honesty.
Clinical improvement is observed in patients treated with redesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, Tionkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in Tiongkok in February 2020, with early results.
However, there is a call for a review of the research.
Korean and Thongkok Health Authorities recommend using chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, while recommending one gram of daily doses, notes that double doses are very dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policy of a doctor who cared for COVID-19.Tingkok’s 7th edition also included interferon, ribavirin, or humifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data indicates that high dose ribavirin is required to block SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing a low concentration barrier to SARS-COV-2.Study shows that the initial precipitation of protein bumps by transmembra 2 protein (TMPRSS2) is important to enter SARS-COV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorokuin and hydroxiclorokuin with or without azithromisin has a great limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not hinder SARS-COV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Siteakin storm complicating can occur at the COVID-19 weight of further steps.
There is evidence that hydroxiclorokuin may have antistokin properties. Tocilizumab has been inserted into treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission Tiongkok after a small study was completed.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 screening at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum feritin blood tests to identify the sitein storms, this drug is meant to fight the sitin storm, which is expected to cause death to some affected people.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the release of sitakin refracter steroids induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, no random and controlled evidence has shown that tocilizumab is a proper treatment for CRS.
Transferring the refined and enhanced antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a method of nonvacin passive immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with non-conclusive results.
The neutralization of the virus is a working mechanism that is expected for passive antibodies therapy to mediate defense against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular sitotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagositosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibodies, for example, is using monoclonal antibodies that are produced, being in development.
Convalesen serum production, which is part of the fluid of patient blood that has been cured and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be enhanced for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wengliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died because of COVID-19 after the outbreak of consciousness would spread the virus.
