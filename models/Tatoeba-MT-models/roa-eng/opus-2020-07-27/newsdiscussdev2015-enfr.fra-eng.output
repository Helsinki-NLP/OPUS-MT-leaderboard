I look like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's common in rugby is big anything...
Yes at last we don't stop Muslim prayers and we don't break a person's nose during the games to drink (unless it's part of the game), but we did paint in black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a game to drink based on the Nazi theme that says.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed quite typical to me.
However, this new information leaves no doubt in my view that they go far beyond misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly that they are trying to provoke as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about it at rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for whom the competition rugby is a tradition.
In other words, old boys from the private.
They are very different from those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are "misogynous jokes" acceptable?
It looks like the rugby club of my university, I've never seen racist behaviour, but the nude races through campus, theft, damage of property and misogynia were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't explain it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body is in part made up of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
thus also ancestral this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:)
@lux You have not read the article well: a small half of the water on your meals is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yeah, well we can all of a sudden consider that the pastis fleet has on average more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad already that
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophic and warm-up of every hair that predicts us the end of oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What evidence is there that heating stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Uh, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophes" as you say to worry about the disparity of the oceans but rather about the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study you quote and your generous effort to quote the source, there is little natural doubt about the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to freshwater problems, I assure you the French are far from being affected xD Then you should stop considering ecology as a dog without fail, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology, yes, religiously dogmatic and irradiated ecology, no thanks.
"Then you must stop looking at ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of the oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 good guys would have come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
I certainly don't!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving backwards, of course.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot in the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any climate model allowed give priority to replantation.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve flora worldwide.
It looks like this scientific fact has never been flattered.
Have you seen the army see it somewhere?
Don't do anything, government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is only a fallacy distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms Wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulfur.
The most abundant of the biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is faulty and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to get the Liberals back to the marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants achieve less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people have to eat them in much greater quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this Member of Parliament is a child is obvious.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from breaking the XVII rules.
However, punishing him and not Thevenoud is incomprehensible for no harm in the world, even if the NS regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady is making a whole deal of it is not her honor, especially as hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who had spoken Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Académie" was offended: "Let's call ourselves the guardian or guardian of the Seals" (post that so far had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure machismo!
"The political arena" .....!
The sandbag, the rear court of the Republic replects, the marigoth of the operat's mouths, the table of the illusions, and ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, thank you, badly.
Qd the Umpist phalocrate sits on the label and parliamentary regulation by turning the + elementary civilization under the false umbrella of good manners, the penalty applies to him "its quality" for his partisan integrity and his mesuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making the provocation to get him to talk about.
Until now he was unknown, now he can take pride in being known as any cancer of a primary class is known.
The academies on the back and we can see that the deputies are sensitive to the pocket...
The PMU will have to focus on solving its internal problems and stop causing couacs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you get him to tell you what she doesn't say.
This Member of Parliament behaves as a collegiate in the midst of a crisis of adolescence, which causes provocation and whose colleagues go, in a delegation, to see the Chief to have the hours of collation cancelled.
and defending him on the basis of a text they have not even read.
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this forum of MPs.
Judge, I call on two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otarias, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that it gives them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are passionate about the majority of our 80 years of working, moving and doing shops.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two of our lifetimes, but we spend the majority in trouble.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, communication necessarily implies a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates if the game will be a race, an object to look for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I adhere to the idea that there is a lot of bullshit about animals that are "playing" while they are simply communicating.
Maybe the game is not only "useful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play based on any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Perhaps yes, hope makes him live...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to answer an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and would have the same tendency to be rather excited by those who seem to be crazy for the first time.
But when you see what many have learned from school, especially from the public most likely to be assaulted by women, my enthusiasm cannot find the least beginning point of anchoring.
"the audience most likely to commit attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rose, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thinking patterns.
It's true that Neuilly's golden youth and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's disgruntled youth too!
If the reactions no longer reacted, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in first choice.
I've never learned anything at school and I've never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do I have to love myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do we start reading life when we can't read?
And are young socialists going to suburban schools to teach equality between men and women?
It would be more effective than making moralising assemblies on Twitter, but it would have to come out of beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're useless everywhere but to teach moral lessons, that's the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke here about using his bread.
This week's article is not going to be cool.
It's not time to joke around the bread, man!
A little sensibility!
You did a double-sense word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old retirement home.
How come the more we pay, the less it's in the plate?
Because the quality of the experiment is not necessarily measured by the weight or the number of calories, just as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more food.
It does not, of course, have to be so.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child's portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least, they made the effort to put on decks.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good food?
Is the Manif for all only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: a kind of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "manufacturing children".
A child should not be raised in a battery breeding or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery breeding?
Where did you get that?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacture", you must demand the prohibition of WFP for heterosexual couples, it would deserve consistency.
I am also surprised that the so-called "for all" manufacture does not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not the only cathos that manifest: other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This, it is still useful to remember that these different churches were all opposed to all the evolutions of society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup was violently opposed to the desire of the gvt to admit girls to school on behalf of the "family defense".
We're still in the same scheme.
And more recently, the same currents have shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became a mixed one.
That is the credit that can be granted to these people's positions.
You don't need to be catho to take care of the marketing of bellys and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom ceases to be that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the same right to love each other.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this is also true for heteros looking for GPA.
I just can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of wild stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given over 42 national team selections...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has scored, I will not talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa bring or bring nothing), but perhaps it would be another reason why it gained was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48 Recommend 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney right now so you can forgive yourself to do so too.
That said, it is good to note that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it from our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In fact, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule it.
I am obliged to ask myself whether you really look at the football or whether you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would mark as many goals if he had as many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's capacity criticism comes from as a football player.
The most difficult is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football qualities (even no attacker) to that of Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without a joke?
There really are people in the mass.
Please also note for your governor that Rooney has not always been England's forward-centre goal machine during his career as a team in England.
Instead, he played the front retreat, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must've written that by kidding me.
In a country where the gun port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those at this school just don't agree with the U.S. authorization to carry weapons!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with fake guns at this age in our house?
Is that actually powerful murderers?
Even if the port of arms is in the American constitution and this necessarily affects the country's culture, I do not believe that the children who are rich are significantly different from ours.
A bit of common sense and sense kept svp.
It's a decommissioning process!
You know what you mean?
Information about this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not have at all, premiums to the taste of the morbid.
Could we start from the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more the maboules of this school than the students!
Let the parents get their kids out of there: she's in danger!
I fully agree.
Those who run this school are clearly completely ill.
Your reaction is much more relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the USA, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
The Relative Youth?
These shiny blue ribs men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled pulley.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at it, but it all seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Opposite, perhaps?
What does it look like to be depressing?
You're ahead of me.
I would have thought that a poor knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "optrusive," he meant "to alienate."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracising still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, we could move forward that their intention was to ostracize her.
But not here.
It seems to have been corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he's been able to say?
Probably nothing, but someone wanted to quote something...
So, yes, the word used in the article was well "stracize", which meant absolutely nothing to say.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still declined in August, about 6%.
I've never seen since 2001.
Gaseous prices fall in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to grow.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
To live there at the moment, I will say that the United States is gradually approaching the explosion as inequalities get crazy.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of funding for electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that is not imagined in Europe But Americans keep incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the English financial community said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forget the most important.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards could not yet give the change...
Based on the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and the poor, a very large majority of citizens, will "trick" or rather bite.
I can't tell him about that Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad causes him to lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the moose, it's played at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for the Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed to "fork the nose of the right in diversity"
The Labour won the partial election, the Tories lost the partial election in a safe seat against the ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it's the same Multiculturalism that leads to the return of the maneuver, the pendulum has stretched very far since the end of the war, and I imagine now it's going to start in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safe seat of Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows it.
Sure, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it's a victory at Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "failure", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but she's thin.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the glaciers in Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are hard.
However, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see Earth more "pasteous" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie speaks of a "simply simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the Earth's crutch, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which gives/gives a) a whip to magma production b) while facilitating its access to the surface ????
In any case, either the "blowing" or the facilitation of localized access to the surface will be (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inversely Regarding climate warming, it seems to me prudent to focus instead on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patriotic, does this Volcanism have an effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Isn't it wise not to warm up any more?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we can see less.
Good morning, the end of the last glacial period was also accompanied by a greater seismic activity, including in the "active" mountain ranges, where on the highly frozen continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia.

Too often it is not known that the terrestrial croute floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it climb or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, delayed, as it passes to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
What gives that the sliding of tectonic plates, as well as tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bud, especially since polar caps are lightened by the ice source, thus causing a change in land balance to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am am amused by this "human," saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created him and which he has so separated that he has become harmful, and to himself and to that environment.
And all this to remain the supreme controller of this nature that surpasses it in the organization of its very viscera, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate its neighbour, one another, mocking of collaboration, money.
The Earth Crout is not based on magma, but on the Earth's coat, which is made of solid rock.
Personally I find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Ascent of Man from Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant 2002 series that was called "Ape-man."
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely enough, almost nobody remembers it now.
Too bad you've never been past the first impression.
Your loss...
"The ice-creams, our distant ancestors" You should look back at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of humanity" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to make a bug eyes in front of a brain in a mouthpiece.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what it says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self-evident, in-self, therefore non-conformity.
Indeed, Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premiums that appear, today individualism structure the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass"!
Without making an inextricable horizon, is there any relation to the Cartesian approach to examining what one receives to believe, what one believes to be.
More than rebellion, doubt is fertile.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid number, he blocked all progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that supports: behavioricism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this and being anti-conformist, it is to fight against this misconception.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of the order.
That's a great idea.
Be beautiful and rebellious, let's ask some...
Blacks and Rebels, the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who look beautiful in their mirror.
In any case, thanks to his controversial contestants to put in the light of the news Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so educationally enlightening.
David Cameron supports the rise in inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will raise its net value once it's out of power.
Business tips, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a negre on the "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once it has passed the gun to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are the ones that will most certainly pay the least of inheritance taxes through super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
He'll be worth £100 once he's passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
He will probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say he is worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We haven't elected him the last time, we've had a coalition instead.
You can't afford to accuse him of lying unless we actually elected him in power.
Just like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and the impending collapse will end it and the rest of its acabitation.
His "rich" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000,000.
We all have to be required to pay for essential services and repay debt.
I agree with you guys.
I do not say that discipline didactics is unnecessary, of course, only that it is insufficient to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other than quantitative approach.
There are 2 possible responses, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to creating a defiance relationship that makes everyone suffer from a loss => there is a need for 1 training in skills to teach.
It's a job that we're learning.
But pedagogy is first and foremost an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy doesn't even match when you're a math teacher!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently lacking is a true vocation in the bcp of those who embrace the teachers.
If gifts exist, the teaching (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students of whom 1/3 tell us: learning is no use at all I already know what I think.
A Slate article quite clearly describes the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Instituters..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it's okay with her time job anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit me!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplay and that allows us to listen to emissions on demand when we want it!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a type usb adapter on the back of my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated to me.
Yeah, I think I cheated on the schedules, I had to hear Richard Lester about three hours.
Even though it's men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, it would at least please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its show is of anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular facilitators, Chris Evans in the morning on Simon May's show the evening when the job is back, is not a woman
It's doing five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be changed.
Shennan knows very well, but he doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached in these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a true journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to get sick or get turned around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alter power and make the country's key to it in less good condition than they did.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnasium, a theater.
But since they don't burn a car, they don't assault, they don't defuse, they don't care about politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, they're under men, sociology is good to look at them.
They have the very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The NF thrives on human stupidity, inculturation and ignorance as much as saying that it still has huge growth potential, it really needs to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on poverty, the fear of daily life, the fear of each other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and learned to save the honour.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for C...
Here's what happens.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact there is less and less resource =>low staffing.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I am saying here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it clear that women can work in the economic sphere and it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfill their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money talks, and if a sex doesn't fit, next time!
The benefits make fun of the life you live.
What are you doing, what's the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The benefits are ridiculed by the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women between 20 and 45 years of age.
That's what my sister said.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about non-remunerated social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) should be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do enough), but it allows our societies to function and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home.
Thank you for all your comments - to go back to Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibilities assumed disproportionately by women when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help a lot of people who have to "check a box".
The tiger is not Russian, it's just Western propaganda.
China alone is responsible for the current situation and would make it better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger entitled to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-term exercises prior to the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no airborne missile in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You make my day!
Oh, yeah, here.
It came to me the same kind of idea right now.
This is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists to annex China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into a well-directed article against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a leaf on the Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the suites of an operation of Putin's coma.
When exposed to the media so much, it is also exposed to irony or criticism.
The return of perpetual victimization of the Soviet-Poutinian sympathiser.
Hollande had also taken the pepper with her camel without being yelled at the anti-French plot.
Here, our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the patron saint of Great Russia, has personally and physically been involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything.
That Hollande's getting fucked up, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to repeat.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth forward, and 73% later, it's a little empty sense of complaining about paternalism.
After all, there's no problem brushing your teeth!
In fact - in substance, complaints appear to be related to the fact that they are targeted to the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be correct, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental subsidies offered by the Department of Labour and Revenues of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a disadvantage in brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the layer of enamel.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can bite the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guiness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth the longest and the Guiness judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the damaging effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
It seems to me to be a rotten experimental design.
The simple act of volunteering for this study has changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That is why most behavioural studies include things like double-blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person with social benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) These are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information on how often they brush or brush their teeth (easily fucked in the air by people who give their results according to the expectations they perceive).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including uterus) may have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these traits may be passed on to the next generation.
Does the uterus graft impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori a problem?
It seems to me that this is going beyond the limits of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not move to go further and further, without the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not boundless and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have the, or children they want to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the brake
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles alone, alone in your little pants alone.
to give them this magic bag so they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it sterilely in my safe if he could still give love.
The present tense circumstances make PR FRYDMAN careful about its communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
Let's put it as an anti argument: cf here these reactions all men curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing at all.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally anodin.
I was registered as a spinal cord donor (I was never selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow myself to judge in one sense or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to women to talk about it.
@Margane: indeed, this has nothing to do with it, and this reinforces the act of love that implies it.
Give a kidney to a member of his family who needs it has nothing to anodine either, and that is done!
Please, don't combine Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's really no competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Sportsman has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything he can to beat all of Real Madrid's goal records this season so he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a tranquil conscience...
I have a hard time believing it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you're talking about the stage of the international oil investment society?
I was looking at it on a connection of shit so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has defended well and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the middle of the field would not get over it too quickly, but they played well.
The Parejo game as a whole becomes better.
A terrible penalty dismissed but rightly saved by Diego.
A hot Mestalla and it shouldn't have been fun for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
It's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, appeared in Archaeology magazine 524 last September.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what we become intuitively.
It's not surprising that before we complicate we've made it simple.
All science progresses by small step.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was it?
Passionant!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a black child mummy had been discovered in the present Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, particularly geographical and temporal (I think it was 1,000 years before the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thanks in advance.
She's a little awkward about reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Did the desert at the time extend no less far than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing to where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough that a European scholar affirms it, even without any evidence, so that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "of his ill-known ancestors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal quacks of the free market and which preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola and on whom the Spanish government is lying, so as not to give itself a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they might remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good at nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristy place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say, it is important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an air military base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals mainly in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervene.
He's just a right wingman in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far to his right and would find his place to the right religious crazy in America.
Now he has to sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party on the right to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is aware of almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting the work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE patterns - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Fr.
Let's move on the anti-intellectualism of the ambient era.
A professor of law at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is the Nobel Prize for Economics and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, that it was true when Dr. Villermé observed the work of children aged 8 hours a day, when the Canuts were shot at by a collective agreement signed.
Ah the good old time...
Your reaction is equally fascinating by your ignorance of the employer of TPE!
Its job is not to know the right in all its meanders, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscripts written on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is one example, one could cite much more, which illustrates the permanent flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which stifling the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to twist the neck to the archi-resassed argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the Helvet, a serious academic would have plunged into the Swiss texts and compared the amount of official texts, then the amount of comments (the absence of them may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
For comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, the case law is intended in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is charged with applying the laws when a employee is dismissed, for example...
Who's complicated??
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, case law, agreements, contracts) are in the area of work and trade in unbearable barriers?
What's he doing?
How long does this last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It's probably time for new revolutionary absurdities to bring criticism to light...
For every article on Ai Weiwei that I have read recently, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on to something else!
See elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not Communist Party spokesmen, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but we had to expose him at all costs (without doing any bad word game).
It's the guy who bursts out of the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
True artists make a difference.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a good poet.
His father was a well-known poet in China.
Exiled during the Cultural Revolution.
KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate the extremists on any side (including Zionists) must be dismissed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the plot, which have earned him several judicial sentences, shame both Israel and Neuilly's mayor.
It represents neither.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against truth alone, marginally.
WHO IS RESPONDING TO ASSEMBLY
What does the Municipality of Neuilly expect to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is harassing a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls to attack this urbanist?
A crime Apology?
Can't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is this a new administration that has these new privileges???
This type needs care, in the same way as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israeli plot and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
In the same way as many people believe in any political decision the hand of "sionists" (the term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even trivial, of an abject anti-semitism "that is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fruitful the belly of the beast my good lady would have returned to Russia of the 19th century!"
To note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of a very bad thing.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the 9/11 conspiracy theory, we are talking about cognitive dissonance regarding how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely full truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable for the admission of this theory to detach it (as in the case of extreme religious).
A logical and inexhaustible flight follows, the end justifies all the means, even the lie, which is a comple, but it seems not to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You are advised to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that is what you do for September 11th.
There are still a bunch of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consorts do not seem to be quick to answer them.
There are indeed very busy theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health speakers find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow !!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what it takes (a little bit) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - will you drink a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by abstaining from it.
The Government will end the pleasures when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advices based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium glasses per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quotation appears to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should consult (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them thoroughly, like smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be grass!
My dad didn't drink and smoke, and the cancer took him to 64 years.
So I will continue to drink my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday evenings (and the other evenings when my wife is not here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a risk of cancer today???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring topic for many years.
He refuses to run when we could run and reciprocally.
I fully agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Both of them destroyed the F1 for the sake of security.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or at least Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely okay with you, but focus on point 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit instances that refused to advance the departure so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly, +1
I would just like to wish for a prompt and quick recovery at Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that failed occurred between troubleshooting cranes and f1 were warnings without charge.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had said it for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the AIF have allowed these maneuvers without exiting safety because?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the profession or the fault of chance when we didn't stop the predictable.
But this accident was.
It should also be said that there was a yellow flag, which means not only "ban on exceeding in the area" but has the first purpose of pointing out a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family to be on TV.
Even under a yellow flag, the pilots are just going to lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more trapping the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can get even at "low speed" compared to a normal pace.
But, well, we're going to cause it in the vacuum, until we've seen the images, we can't issue a proper opinion.
I don't see much that changes.
Are there any injured?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there are still jobs where you have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people who are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be animals injured like bears, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and the Toronto agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In Saskatchewan's countryside, trains do not derail as by charm, and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains parade very, very often in one day.
In addition, as the roads often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass in densely populated areas, because people still want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the centre of a city, as it was a central element of the original construction of railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a story on this last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
Actually, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad.
However, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Railway Society of Canada are expected to attend the next Conference on Hazardous Products in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transportation of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, makes the impasse on the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be other truths.
The whole problem is there, and the exegesis of theologians only reinforce this, or what good is it to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said, that's right - that's wrong" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim countries but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words: obey to the priest priest pastor Rabbi Imam and pray your prayers, it will be better!

May His appendix Nouillesque touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way by trying to build a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather pale at the moment) or that of the free market (possibly supported by the state when it needs to cool) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious events.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where rationality emerges, the religious is at the trailer and expresses himself in schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even though it also carried forms of contestation.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time is not without doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misunderstanding of the "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts, which are filled with explicit pleas to the hate of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is moderate religious (and fortunately the most numerous) who "read the texts misread" and retain only what belongs to humanism and common values to all humanity, atheists and diverse believers.
For me, fanaticism is the dumb and wicked application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "believers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if we do not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in situations of self-defense.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous in the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Are you not guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the clip?
Neanderthal band overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've hated humanity enough!
What they brought us frankly apart from having outraged us with the neighbours, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Satan of Tasmania and that satan Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you'd see Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and still source inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers like Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The remarkable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe was New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Allow me to be of different opinion.
Sox does not need any help in this section.
How I managed to guess it would be a "little white"!
Another fan of George Lazenby.
Delighted!!!
But are you married to Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The coolest.
His articles are badly missing.
She understands whether she's found Putin and those who support him.
Go to Leviathan in the cinema, you'll understand a lot!!
Nice effort Savantcosi!
But you don't know yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher who only has that to do with his days.
We leave him for a month, and when we return he's in the process of spilling the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 killed since the ceasefire are civilians of Donbass victims of bombings of the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the responsibilities suggested in the article without dare to go until explicitly identifying separatists is in the otanesque line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European gentile neo-Nazis facing the wicked Russians courageously
@SavantCosinus: browser change.
I'm opening this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your words the wicked are the Ukrainians and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "this note has absolutely no purpose to say that pro-Donetsk resistances are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
Alexandre Kastals: From where do you keep these details about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrollable elements (possible to say anything)?
Go to Romania!

And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
However, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative", which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would bleach the money at their will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popeescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill-advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him an unpunished conviction), and was therefore sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
The trial also took place from the prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the Steaua Mihai Stoica manager, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also carries a penalty for trying to sweat (and subsequently conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, in order to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to handle was our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I always taste as much as that moment.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that implied that the money that the police had confiscated to Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor uneducated guy, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he'll never do it.
Hungarians are just a band of nationalist assholes today.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and shop windows, and where they branded racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have had tickets this time, but not.
I thought Neil Lennon was ready to take the reigns back to Al-Ittihad.
Wherever it ends, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County refused it.
Super article.
If it was Sarkozy who did that, we would have heard the left scream like a big sick man.
But as is the kind Hollande, friend of the unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but all down
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer that a party claim from the left settles in power.
It is the bankers who have financed the victory of Obama, and they have not been paid for their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (not how)
Should employment become more widespread in early 2015?
I hope that in the wake, the fiscal center, it will also generalize the absolute control of the gougnafiers commonly called ploutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasions, stealing patterns, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a phrase without the words banksters or ploutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true when we have class, we treat the population of unsaved and unsaved teeth.
Every new period of unemployment is dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who most often do not even hold up an accused receipt, it was automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from the Pole Employment.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" patronymy of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here a chained duck article?
It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means.
It has been learned that controls have led to the removal of persons who for over half of the time no longer had unemployment benefits.
We wonder how people can be controlled that we never see.
We wonder what punishment is for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if one can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, one wonders how it will help recruitment.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in the football as well?
Should we drive them out of the EU?
The EU was the only economic source and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It makes no economic sense.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most unequal society.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt Mafia referees who are UEFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this lucrative organization rotting and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what the hell is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for playing Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Removed from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to have small symmetrical phrases retorted, just the story of the polemic?
Whatever it may be, it is a fact that every small event towards peace, there has been, there is and there will be people who will throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that this only explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action should be taken against the over-armed Israeli State occupying an oppressor colonizing destroyer.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was for nothing in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr, let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
The fact that Morocco is the colonialist is obvious!
But as for Israel, we also need to question history, its allies, and its support to see the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a settler.
Gaule was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as that of a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish can be part.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jewish people, hence contentious.
Conclusion: To solve the conflict, we must break up with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jewish.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that need to be stopped ignoring.
First, the Zionist European project (columnising Palestine) implied dispossession of the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has failed to bite from the start.
Their tender result will give them what their fingers bite from.
He should start his rehabilitation by small plugs.
I hope he hasn't lost his appetite.
So many subtleties are tolerated, including racial insults and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yes, I hate all these molarizers.
Football is a contact sport where the heels exist and yes, therefore, players hurt themselves.
The fact of getting his teeth into the flesh of an opponent for having the advantage certainly doesn't have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for having made a similar gesture.
This is now the third time Suarez does this.
If you bite somebody at work.
What would the consequences be to you?
I knew someone was gonna bite.
If you're dyslexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm slightly dyslexic.
I forgive that two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was eager to come back and play with his teeth.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost got sick of the punch.
A prerequisite for a good school course is the respect of the students of their teachers and of the school.
This works if parents instill that respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In the good institutions, those who make progress their students are considered partners, not emm..
Who may believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (to teach, to educate, to learn respect, the limits, to live together briefly) It is to parents to do at least 50% of the rate.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Focusing on parents is not operational.
No one really took them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school could have a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
Would it be wrong for actors (professes, hierarchies and ministry) to play their part and do not constantly reveal what they are doing.
We can dissolve a team that leans to reboot it, not families.
How can we not talk about teaching?
It is true that communication courses allow for exchange.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's first role.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if there is a parent's requirement, it's that the school provides training for their children.
Which minister would dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Disappointed article: little information, partial and destroyed reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beautiful East suburb?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think it's more of Willoughby, and so of the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let it fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squarely true
That's right.
A little one of Aloysius.
Its electorate is Sydney North's seat.
Truly a beautif of the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers wanted to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously conclude that both are led by the party of Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
He goes for a grumpy, today. :(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis on hunger.
You would be rather bitter too if you wake up one morning and re-examine that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and unlawful benefits to life will never be beyond your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then abandoned it.
At least he's not threatening someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fear of the result.
And so much for employment in France that it has nothing to do, it emanates from vegetables always ready to break up when their corporation has losses in markets, especially outside...
that's precisely because their lobbying didn't work out that the command was canceled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or arrangement for marpol, no doubt the project would have succeeded.
Then, to know whether it's right or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice for "the world" to lean on it!
The Brittany Ferries company is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn tax and drought centres.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem to me to be normal.
Well to the extent that armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it is normal to wait for a coup d'état.
Or then we are condemned to tolerate British monopolizing the market.
It's a choice.
Eternal French problem that sees its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people different from the middle Parisians live.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That is and after they will create the Breton Pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain Bretons.
With this, they're sure they're going to make the costs go down significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "detesting everything related to the prog", since they have just broadcast a documentary of one and a half hours on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
Regarding Hackett's solo career that would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s," I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he has had various degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour does not have the right to collect a lot of demos to half-finish and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett asks nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely brilliant, and quite in the mind of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an equally interesting story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would still say that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it ADORAIT progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest screams "prejudiced": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Song absolutely beautiful.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a thrilling success.
There will always be a difference of size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do it from the very right and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
That is, they have no excuse.
They're defenseless.
Yes, we've understood your point of view for the first time.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
There is a need to have the spirit of dispute over the community of mortals in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his misconception of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, the healing of the innocent victim's relatives: a distorted understanding of which will never be able to take advantage of those who decide wisely of the death of others from the sound and just reasoning of their pedestrian.
However, in an attempt to balance the analysis, one might nevertheless argue that the sentenced person to death, often, has exercised a savage violence, which he has been able to enjoy, against a truly loving person, who has paid the costs free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain lessened with the disappearance of the one who was the bourreau, sometimes the tortonaire, of being loved and haunting their nights.
Let us not neglect their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this reflection I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he has great intelligence.
The one with the heart.
That's probably what I've been reading more just for a long time.
However, we thought reading stories of another era, ancient things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that clamor, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same is true for the other two "Great American Romance" quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all perfect.
I thought I stopped your white one, man.
What's it rhyming about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is unremarkably better than this painful Bellow, who has received him the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we should have an American winner, we could also have a racist [legger].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geny novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph, on the other hand...
Who did you read?
How many books did DeLillo's anti-DeLillo read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter novels, the crazier, the smaller, and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll end up underworld someday.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from Delillo to reject his talent as a writer, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...??
It's of simple interest.
It was a trait of humour, "the law", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady acted in His sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that we wonder what the term "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll get very expensive!
Yeah, the state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him about danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and only seek tranquility.
The flood zones that become constructive from day to day when a large construction program starts there, is classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the flood plains near the rivers.
We have been told that "there are no more flooding today thanks to the regulatory dams."
Now you need to enlarge the retention lakes up and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
By land.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer, here, the interest?
Take the calculator out and you'll dream of the life you might have been in place of Ms. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Fauute sur Mer and former Chair of the Urbanism Commission, who grants the permits to build!
The 2 mothers of the triumphant Sarkozysme are the old and the real estate.
I'm from the left and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but svp, no low political or low blows all azimuth, we're not in there in a fight of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So, what kind of shit do you live in?
The U.S. is not a shithole.
Yeah, the U.S. cops are hardened because of the racals they're dealing with every day.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops "come to mess them up because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, and it is unfortunate that such an incident is needed to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
The good cops must denounce the corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the math.
Such open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's you who clearly don't pick anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it's not from oximal speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent of the tension on this issue at this time.
And therefore, the boundary between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, so the treatment suffered by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me with the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate those responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
That man goes to Elysée has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is cross-checking, verification, analysis.
And here we understand that the sarcasts are concerned about each other.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-sarkozysm based on business mounted from any parts (a place and no convictions) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 retaliation), two Dutch friends journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is your partisan mind that blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not teleguided !!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's supports are unworthy!
From the extract I've read, VA's article is only spraying the spray.
I even laughed at it so bad.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of ending because journalists are not "strong" in the secret of sources, is it not?
In contrast, there seems to be no connection between VA and power when there appears to be agreement between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation of the world on the merits and its dangerous relations.
We are well in front of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government to fall.
Hence this editorial to the abois, which says a lot about complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of the left or the right, it's more serious.
I thought the smell would be good with the smoked herring!
It is simply for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I were an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration, but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people who came in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperative, even refusing even to give soup crazys simply because of the lady's religion, she also refused to enter her place of worship although she told her that she was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't at ease"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and contests this must be admired even if he is a director of the pub :) It's so much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If that country were more left, it would be communist.
In your opinion, what has New Labour done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this is repeated, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to fit the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-east-permitted, the politically correct one that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is the center of the left and not the communist, I said this to be a joke, which I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you, are specific examples of gauchist policy, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked for, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour had done, which was especially on the right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who are now coming to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We beat in 40 45 to fall into another discacture, that of money.
We're going to make nice savings by turning these technocrats...
The treaties should be renegotiated.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" to another meaning in Europe, should it not?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider unfair tax competition between companies.
This must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
In terms of terms, this means that whole pans of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment that has already been the victim of many territories will only strengthen.
Everything to sacrifice, including the advancement of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that we will need to deal with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means of clarifying the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions feel they pay for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential today when public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I don't see very well what the competition for TERs could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that is the case, shouldn't he be the head of the striker?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to an end from pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
However, it would make sense for me to begin the process of separation between your life and the complications you have inherited.
Looks like it's what they're doing, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem to persist while new ones are surfaced, have you thought about a "plan" of "fleet" so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a detrimental effect, but with a compassionate real estate corporation, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be solved.
He looks vindictive and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and to provide support to help her get back to work and pay for maintenance.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made up of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice.
Tell them that he will not necessarily make his promises about contact and ask them to reflect on how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their own good, despite your own resentment because of the way he has treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loving you and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuing relationship with father/child, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I think that children eventually understand who is wrong, if they are allowed to see things by themselves.
Go still a little effort you are close to Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years civilization has disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the pot of iron.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that makes in the least so-called social, fiscal, but also environmental has a competitive advantage, and the others are forced to follow.
All policies seek is growth, Growth.
International coordination would be necessary, but by now...
It is not the climates that produce C02.
It is everyone who is heating up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in houses that he has had to build, those who buy industrial products that he had to produce and transport.
It is not the climates that have shown against ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climazosceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climazosceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move for conferences.
Individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on automobile, etc.).
And politicians act in part depending on the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But good is it may be humorous to say that the expression is Terminator.
"The greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what that is, but any good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it's about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo of the Guardian: How long before someone puts the blame on immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the skull that took all the money.
Do we count the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I'm putting the blame on the democrat liars.
Or the democrat crooks.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump in a car or plane to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Sex with monkeys, is that better?
You think it's a virus?
I don't suggest you ask for an antibiotic prescription.
He hired Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Oh, shit, really!
Don't use the word immigration, you're gonna scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our retirements, to take care of our old people, to empty their toilets, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year from hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and hat, which allow you to warm up, to extinguish heating and to eat this sandwich in cheese).
Don't be such a dick.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or is it not meant?
It's more comfortable...
That's how public money is wasted to allow a small minority of individuals to spend good time in space making gaffs and rumbling while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So TV reality has not invented anything and the authorities are certainly waiting for a baby to be conceived there to ignite the world and brighten media coverage to Western royalties that are used to tabloid maternity.
Perhaps they should come down to the ground to see that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, men or women are not being sent into space to make pancakes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives have come from space research.
So, yes, it's money that's spent usefully.
You can cite one thing that improves our daily life and comes from space research.
It's just a little bit of money.
the ball pen that works the point in the air (for example, write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treats?
To participate in the manufacture of an unnecessary item?
Or suggest how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and it represents the voidity itself.
Oh if the last high tech game.
Behind the infamous minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to drive the cargo to the station.
If you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think about buying plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy them in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to belittle people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic pictures of "swords in plastic" ?
Or even to be curious enough to ask yourself what was meant by the inscription (if any) on it?
Bad typical storytelling, it is due to the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
Dirani's family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to bring the governments down in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small coverings that are given in the rapid remains can perch the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you have stated support his argument in fact.
I saw on occasion these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East to Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful newties, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a large cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weighs in budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the borders of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even though more than 3,000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, test water-saving showers and advocate the placement of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (150 m3 / year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while keeping the same comfort.
This is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that is no longer able to produce enough surplus (which it would then have redistributed in real terms as an increase in income) to make these surplus pay the increase in the spending you place in the "stressed expenditure" category.
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that could constrain, increasingly decades after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes any physical transformation possible.
Since producing, basically, is to transform, energy is this to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure to increase on energy production (unfortunately called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, forces in turn to increase production (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not we are able to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only be able to go further in the years and decades to come (the EIA, in these latest reports, clearly indicates that conventional oil production peaks, understanding, are achieved in 2008.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it makes things even.
Take this to France!
Vote No 18.
Are you a Guardian's webmaster?
As was noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
That's good work, guys.
Although many English people like to mock the Scots when they only lose, they don't have to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get themselves eliminated at the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if you're playing against them ;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because, now that the "golden Shige generation" retreats, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the 11th of departure, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class" is David Beckham, a bit effeminate, perhaps, but I believe that if he was tacking a potato overweight like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget its athletic constitution, moreover, by talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney... ?
I never laugh at Scots.
I tend to surprise myself by observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the night...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, was really "international class" is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best, a very good player.
It's about that Juppe would have had trouble asking 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he'd get them if he asked them...
You mean people come to laugh a lot?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his deputies' allowances...
I ask myself, above all, what he can say in his lectures.
How to reduce the deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer in a scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will consider asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their – free – conferences are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, these two figures are being reported.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It all lights up for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
Do I feel like he's being criticized for making money???
I am far from being one of his fans, but that he is being reproached for having wrong (or fraudulently) managed his campaign OK.
But holding conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Epidemiology Rule #1: Isolating.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane to Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I can see them forbid all flights and boats to the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that says...
What a shame it is that the international media panic about Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all under threat.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's a newspaper article so sad, so big a title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first providers of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
So much smarter comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and differences in gender roles that could help fight Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get in there, think and write, we're not happy with the noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you're not able to offer good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same level as beheading - a form of equally barbarous terrorism, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - saying that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" in his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "maturating" as a world resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who in the editorial team lets it go?
For a territorial or other election the money doesn't count.
I am constantly reading that the territorial civil service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will probably be lies and truths, to us to separate the good grain from the truth.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to account for such economic miseries.
It's true that they never had anything to manage the people on Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficits they have funding needs that can only relate to and only to their investments.
A force to use concepts too vague the press as the World makes the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, the debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-recruitment of civil servants (for example, to make nice roundabouts) carries a growing and incomprehensible burden (compulsory burden until their deaths, since life-time + retirement), these communities are cutting in investments.
The staff member's status should therefore be abolished, prior to the decrease in staffing.
And also responsible for the mayors financially.
It's fabulous, the intercommunes would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the communal strength and it's the opposite that happens, proof that adding a level is not effective without removing others.
How do you want to properly manage big territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionized, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't want to stay in jail, worse, in the administrative room, he'd look like it!
Let's even try garrote, It's not too strong to explain the situation of blockade to which the state of the Vème led with its providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then he went on to get to the "sudden end" series coming up loud about.
Why won't they live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco over a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Do not even try the answers of the kind "it is the fault of the whites".
"response" not "response"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry up to be the first.
Whether sarcasm or not, there is an argument to pass.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo sapiens evolved in North East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly humid period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Defence Minister had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to hold the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resign!
in 2017:Transformation into a comfortable private hotel of gold closets for future retired residents of the Republic ?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the rich and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the military will take care of the flu from the last person elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all over the world?
London Wasps?
I've been sorry for their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, outdoor travel for the Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the trouble of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did not do us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a good supporter and which until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage resumed by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent CCFC problems, but this must be a good gif.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except some Wasps fans at work.
They and a few thousand other people in the Southeast will surely follow them from afar or will they now have to support another team?
Good pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then, why are not all computer systems based on these concepts???
+because a giant mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is to be the first in the segment.

But these do not sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been in an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who're going to lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It looks like they're reasoning with Make us more profit, and don't make healthier dishes and the best price ratio.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh yes, be careful that people don't have too much fat.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in there, it replaces the real ingredients.
We would also do well to add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you have to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to business kitchen.
Are there family restaurants and are they offering tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What's happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal work accident that went wrong.
A young promising man, learned to steal, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man broke everything and brutally interrupted this vocation birth.
For him to be sentenced to 10 years in prison, he seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
I totally agree!
What a humor!
The desire to unravel is obvious and difficult to excusable and painful at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to disqualify is difficult to excuse.
That's why I have a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he never saw his son again, but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who is really a victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!
The kid's father was convicted of what he did.
With regard to the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, he knew quite well that the bullets are dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years, that's a little bit in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot at this young man to make noise?
Really, it made noise!
If the occasion occurs, go on vacation in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
I've done it twice, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
I'm sorry, the valley of the Moselle, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
However, rather important, German farmers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations do experiments with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region that should be recommended - Franconie, the Rhenan Palace (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of German style (or perhaps it is the reverse, brief).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry white during the meal, they now offer a lot of it, and with a much higher alcohol content than their 9 degrees preferred.
But their traditional wines bottled to the property are so complex, the gentleness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a lobster thermodor next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnston is a good guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of the time.
From time to time, there's an article about German wines that are coming, the new dry Baden's that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it's not these disgusting Liebfraumilchs that people drank when they were young (you, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I address myself to the over 40 years - who, as I say, have already seen it all).
Closing the Val de Gracia would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the deplorable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grandfather who did their studies there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these camaraderie of ministries that are held by the barbitette, and these decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in the Sun Green: euthanasia at 70 years.
Moreover, meat could be resold that will feed our poor assets (sic) as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find jobs for our unemployed, real jobs, and you won't have any deficit problems!
For the elderly, it has come time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, in the process of disappearance, will not be able to maintain this demographic transition alone...
So of the geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise of a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the entire post-war model!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that is best known in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls we're really fucked up.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals aren't up there.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are being cared for elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the supply of public service in other hospitals than to retain a medicine at two speeds.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a fault, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The hospital day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is just one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to get a better job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country from two non-citizens is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to some remarkablely high standards, with obvious hard consequences.
Why???
It seems to me to do two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all persecutions and ill-treatment and war that drive people out of their countries and force them to come for help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returns to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe in this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the abuse that was still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of the Tamils with links to the LTTE, thinking that they are at risk of torture when they return.
UNHCR revised its asylum application assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that people with TTE-related status be considered at risk upon return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, the coconut's been gone with such a periodicity.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
I didn't have an health insurgency in the States?
So I wouldn't have had you given years treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expense during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes earth.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!
There is still little, we were explained that ebola kills so quickly that a large epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of the people taken was zero.
It's weird that we're more comfortable, the more I'm scared.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or too weak but not null.
Finally, it is a scientific fact, the more a virus is deadly quickly (in general) the less likely it is to spread because the host's death signs its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After this is the 40th general to save humanity. ..
There is nothing obscene about media outlets of certain brave and virtuous Westerns, but to the detriment of thousands of other Africans who are unaware of the profession, the bravery, the virtues?
Of course this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but repetition of the announcements is a terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so beloved by the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative penchants would have taken them away from their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heating tower for when the problem really gets out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Future Market Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would likely be only a black emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope Australian voters come to see this great Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Future Contracts Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low-income people.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, Telstra's "lander liar" and its End Market Fund have been excellent guardians to him.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noted it, corrosive enough as a remark.
If only it could deter her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst destination for a career-end policy: not to be recognized on the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her town of Toulouse as being enough to manage her.
Like the "provincial" good sense is good!
We're living in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I'm against the port of burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdotal tells us is pure sarkosism: poor minors in the rank of ministers, confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on every hit of the road to show that he is well-guarded by public order), rudeness and extra-recuity brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become unworked to carry a firearm and a badge, so that they would have all the pleasure of exercising their self-proclaimed function as justices.
But who's Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I want this agent who didn't know about Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the blow
Don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if she doesn't exist, we should invent it!
But it's easy, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this occasion, N.
Morano clearly does indeed, in the contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, who would probably have multiplied the curves and the "Yes, Madam, of course, right away, Madam, tell me which direction I must run to catch myself without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think that Isis is going to exceed them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone counted the corpses now no one here does.
As for civilian deaths at an industrial level, nothing rivals Western war machine.
I do not agree, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (which includes non-Western) between the two wars in Iraq would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions for the "war machine" deferral.
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to the order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and unconcerned in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - probably a reason why they have occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents have not wasted time to mark their main enemy when they saw it, in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's GQ that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bombing is either, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission was targeted like this.
Well, good note, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths from Western nations (at least with recent disorders in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument to exaggerate statistics that are notoriously unreliable.
The only figures even vaguely reliable on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious as Saddam Hussain refused to leave objective inspectors to see the facts.
Of course, it was in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable believe that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not worth better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in less than five years of age was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course we must fear it, but also the gift of games in general.
It is necessary to stop acting as though people were pure spirits, that love was all that the children needed, and that they could be done with unknowns that neither the parent nor the child might ever know, without consequences to them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are from genealogy.
It is an essential and contemptuous thing to know its origins.
Instead of making it clear and using fantasist arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or designed with gift games.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the games you came out of, you might hand over, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances in LDCs (e.g. uterus grafts) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire of children justifies these acrobatics and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
It's just like a point.
It's obvious that we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I've met with my wife.
But at the same time, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming very disabled, contracting a serious illness, losing all of his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the cares of life is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent you from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer bears any form of frustration, where the child becomes a lot of consumption, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The child's desire is not a whim where one can use the other according to his good will.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
