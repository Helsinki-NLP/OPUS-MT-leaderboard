Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
On second reading, MEPs rejected the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for reaching a disadvantageous priori agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the regime's political vengeance and has provoked a process of biased suspicions of the court to the west as well.
The draft annulling paragraph 365 of criminal law, on which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victoire
Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its defeat.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined by the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but it is moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual right of Charia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime, because for a flight, you cut off your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, potential non-respectors of faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Koran who will join in the place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya it will rule such an order as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably not advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted help with the recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who led the attacks of NATO, but rather Allah, whom they celebrated in every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the conquerors in Libya, the West is not a part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our polithics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without it bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militarily with Libya.
So there is no problem for the premises getting rid of "crossed".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of human rights.
So that we can't stop these charia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A round of statistics went on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published the GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all the records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published their economic development visions earlier in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany moved better than expected (increasing 0.3% instead of 0.1% predicted), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a matter of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decrease in economic growth.
Results are worse than analyst forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy had a growth of 0.5% according to the forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what analysts had expected.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2%.
The 10-year bond performance is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are climbing towards critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech obligations remain below 4 per cent while the situation worsens in the region.
In Germany , votes were taken to say that the ECB should be the last instance 's guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrated the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has fought with great luck in the second part and will not miss out on the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed reporting.
No particular excitement in the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
Czech representation has also won thanks to the Super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure up to the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vices of the match were Damjanovic and Vuccinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech, Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and also a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech Football Fund.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were difficult to set up combinations and the game focused mainly on the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not come to lose the Czech defence, which has responded specifically to long shots even in the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They have created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
In this way, they openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weaponry.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: don't eat breakfast and take charcuterie for dinner
More than one third of 9-13-year-olds have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren weigh above the average and 5% are obese.
As evidenced by current research, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models around it is.
The tables of obese children include 50 per cent charcuterie more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "obesity is not an accident"
In the families of the small big sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last year of school and participated in 900 students from primary schools in Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not an accident", supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from 6th to 3rd enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or obese is the absence of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - breakfast - tasting-dining, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner charcuterie
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each has its own breakfast.
And the worst thing that's been noticed is that one tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children consume unhealthy fries more often in families.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks each day of the sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of children questioned do sports on a regular basis, but for parents it is only half, 15%.
Prepare your diet.
Another part of the survey allowed chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"Czech children's preferences between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal food."
Among their favorite dishes are cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch it is the pasta that took first place just in front of the white meat.
Children did not want to be fruitful, and the preference for fish and vegetables was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of monitoring a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the "Obesity is not a chance" awareness session, a strong desire to go to a healthy diet," said the survey's results.
The most striking was for example with regard to sweet lemonades because children have begun to give preference to drinking water.
Children mostly checked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sugar dishes and "knedlike" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry because there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen later.
The presentations of three specialty professionals, the dress of characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to final exams, the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "bourré".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) treated the way to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other has a body of boy, without a particular curve, another one of the superpoids.
The stylist should know how to optically resize wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight beautifully the character and also not to dress too visually of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, this is worth the effort to make themselves fit.
And you won't regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slips permanently, wraps and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of stitched fabric, or even embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that because of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know Victoria's Secret from the campaign.
Deep down, it pleases me, because it's better than wearing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodleboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress only the physics but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphicist, has entertained us of all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse appearance at the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphicist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talent stylist knows how to work with a single dress differently.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench-coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a lightweight coat but also it can dress also the naked body, with scarves and take it in photo as a dress.
Or it's enough to lift the sleeves or neck and have a new look immediately.
"Play with it" he pointed out.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to contravene it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the Ben fashion photographer that the stylist must have much more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have about ten pages (i.e. ten models) I must be ready to "cut it off" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, who is not a super singer, but her image and marketing made it a world star.
In Czech, the approach to the use of stylistic services remains still chilly.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (just that I know something but what I seem to be going to second rank).
And if someone gets a styling on our side, then we have to count on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we just have to sail on google and make sure if the news of boulevard tells of the celebrity in question, if it has lean or thick etc...
Honza and Mario gave us Sunday on the heart that it's not enough for the stylist to move in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not to flatter themselves, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his closet and fill it with new elements you cannot throw everything and tell him, My God what a horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he'll advise you on what to wear," said Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as scissors, rollers for depilation, or even feeding pins, it is also found in nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could sink, fortiori to the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt.
So we really need skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me for my creation.
The count I'm doing is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a short summary of what we learned during the second week-end of course
I am increasingly beginning to understand that doing styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
By Way of Review
Originally, a problem-free race is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do in a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to some extent everyone's ambition, but it doesn't serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part of The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to get out a kind of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the passages added in which the main hero came out of his car and did what he wanted.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole draws down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years.
These are not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible faanethosis on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're caught up in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them he's taking part in illegal races across America.
You are sitting behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the stages in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful overhang even though the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very nice visually.
Tests are more than once in time with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you will find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to that, the different races are well organized behind each other.
There is only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (like in a classic race) and then run against the watch ( classic duel with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer times like this than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as well because this element is not likely to interfere and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that approve the game.
The model of driving is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you'll have to go and see elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the competition the model of driving goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a certain time.
To the difference of the driving model, the collisions are not yet in progress.
We do not expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight overruns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy shells.
Or you'll find yourself in tights.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The restart is done so that when you broke your figure or you went out in the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering from memory the piece of itinerary in question.
The great hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that we must go through in a certain way if this does not happen.
Otherwise you meet on a given location "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute in late.
What upsets you are the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and turn them around or brake them either.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" so that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you still have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
It gets the most annoying at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at any cost pass before you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the sight of other vehicles in the reverse direction and you collide a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it's clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You need to watch out for petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars however most of the time the one you have enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American bicycles for the right highways and super sports cars around exotics on the very technical routes, for example on the lake roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that are common to challenges and adventures.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (this looks like) where you drive in the darkness on the tracks (this looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (pre-) and behind you comes a metro branch that sends you the car directly to the ferry.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is usually pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is troubling is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not take the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young audience a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game makes it feel like it's not over.
Fun is really good, but prepare yourself for the fact that the faults hit you in the eyes with the force of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festival Festival Academica for the third time offers festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs of high schools and secondary classes.
The festival's closing is composed of two concerts organized on 17 November.
"The Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Of the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the committee of the festival sits the rector Vaclav Hampl," says the leader of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The festival is the concert of the Choeur des lycées and secondary classes that takes place with free entry on November 17 from 14 hours on the space in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
In the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening there is the concert "Students of velvets" in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of higher schools occur as well as that of Charles University.
The aim of the Festival Academy is not only to celebrate the International Student Day with dignity and to remember the 22nd anniversary of the velvet revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop creative cooperation of young people.
The principal organizer is the Czech-desired Union in cooperation with lycée Jan Kepler.
All the action is placed under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, mastic meetings, student learning and other activities.
All information on the Internet pages of the festival is available at www.festaademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act as negativists and Euroseptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically abolished the balance between institutions"
"I wasn't expecting such a tough war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players are used to their new role", as well as Milena Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law by the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of speakers from Charles University Law School could send it, she showed how much she takes her motto "comprehensive and openly about Europe" seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning the criticisms he is fade felt, that it is a leather round, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say that he has cut everyone's breath because he has his role in perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?" so as an important step towards unity and greater legibility of Union policy in the face of the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our syrecky (cooky pasta cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicentova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs solved the major financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "the activity has beaten her full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself even now.
In addition, the new European Union's seventh budget must be approved, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be small and for savings, what sector will be the priority, which countries will be most helped, at least, is all to be resolved in future negotiations.
Mrs. Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, different large bananas, or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Euroseptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect rather than positively.
She is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
In her view, the fault results from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar and the Slovak come to me, this French man tells me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what does this group of Visegrad still do?" and he's not at all happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, new tough budgetary rules are waiting for the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is not at multiple speeds, which prevails rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro zone and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
First it was said that the countries that want it and those who do not want it are cooperating with each other."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Mrs Vicenova expects.
From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis that all themes having an impact on the EU must be debated among all EU members and not just the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the voice that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest one would be "the long term".
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm feeling as very current and however since its creation it has passed 100 years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (as well as the title of the internal magazine IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it remained faithful to its basic values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in the first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "has stated for the anniversary the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano.
A Well - Prepared System
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees such as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only among the first U.S. employees to have the holidays paid, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and commercials.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed client relationship system.
The society was at first great in the discovery of talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a Virginia Rometty - which should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
It has been working with IBM for thirty years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years has been doing what is called jamy, brainstorming online from what has resulted from many future strategies and innovations.
It's not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that provides it with a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard's Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony of the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is called familiarly in the United States in view of its slogan - it grew up in 100 years to become one of the largest firms in the world.
This is, of course, the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the server's product level up to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries are the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.

Not all of the innovations and manufactures that had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed the bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, the Online Prodige service or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot emotionally remain hanging on the past," observed Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for one fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 it was with more than the strongest hardware representative participation motive.
From 2000 onwards IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology perspectives.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it has overcome the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
Now it appeared that IBM is passing through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share has continued from 2008 as a blend of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the company IBM is to change everything but not its values.
This can be expected for this flexible giant to control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago and initially had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history was linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "higher" ones, the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who had presided over the Society's Supervisory Board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that have been based until now on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kusqu' firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all the possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat slicers to the register boxes.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the turnover increased to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturne and in 1969 on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
With regard to IBM's trade area, there was little time ago developing a "Smart Trade" platform that helps businesses manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong story on our territory as well.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague, and there is also the research and development team at the global level that deals with the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep that ass, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and a lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only it could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in the summer to Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not turn off the singer.
And he publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's liaison and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the door of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my dear and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," left Rychtarova to filter by showing that she has left her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife has set up a paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does that apply to you as well?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them out of their sleeve.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices who come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Procurement
Does your half of you make remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion to making purchases.
But you'll say, which would resist the window-leather of the clothing stores, to look for for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you have told your spouse he's waiting at the entrance...
Unsatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to lean at least 5 kilos - should I start playing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't those phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah?
So you are part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more women become poisonous.
Hate and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, make the dust, unearth the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they came out of the washbasin, crushed the glass in the living room, and what does that give you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to be aware that there is no need to exaggerate and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire of cleanliness, however, can spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of survival
"Put this worn overcoat to the trash."
"Do you plan on putting those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much work of a rapper...
Defamation, perspilling
Defamation, persiflation, but also insults against someone are also the same as some women.
Women are particularly drawn to relationships and thus are happy to deal with subjects such as, where, with whom, how, and why.
Maybe each of us will let a little harmless perspill escape here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persul, even look down on others and are for their own involvement - especially at work in a women's group - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in Philadelphia's victory
The hockey attacker Jagr has twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday match on Caroline's ice and is again in the lead of the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has made one more pass and was appointed the best player of the game, he has scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told the ultra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
One minute later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the Butor Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer went down, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely at Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the three best," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd be playing a career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really glad about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years at NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that end at two to one.
"Pronger carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took speed and (Read) left to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens did not stand against an experienced defender their advance of two butsets lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that mainly haunted the local coach rather than lost hands because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's what it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender who took part in Winnipeg's thirtieth attack and the victory on Tampu Bay.
5 different shooters participated in uax goals of the Jets, which arrested a series of five lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travels to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A large exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a trend for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even in the context of socialist countries.
If Czechoslovak wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, an invitation letter was required if the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, there was a need to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the condition for travel to the west was denied to the "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs were buying and this habit has lasted so far.
The Czech voyages have since 1989 been a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days on vacation in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are unaware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the West has caused a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for long to the west by plane that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations put Czechs in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with itself its own food canned, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which finally enabled our tourists after decades of free purchasing of Western currency.
Our standard of living, as well as the average wage, have increased what has led to another important moment around 1997.
As a result of a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter links since 1997 which through contracts have greatly reduced the costs compared to what was before.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free links with almost most developed countries around the world apart from the EU that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since then, as every year, direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to the distant hot countries, there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to settle fully in the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacation abroad including the related charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but that could end with a situation without a "path" solution.
Almost 5months ago Czech football was without President and it risked that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic would not yet be known after yet a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to what voting rules must be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to begin voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the leadership of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure he called his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era football returned back to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily at the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with the way in which it was to be elected.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - as well as the statutory representatives, or also the staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since this moment with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still remain with regard to the regulation for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The discord apple lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model", found one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round is won by the candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the room for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes in the two chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, who understands the objections of the Morave party and according to which it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even if he considers that the settlement of elections established according to the most advantageous status Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish maximum voting in accordance with the Statute of the Association."
"For there to be still no succulent ideas imagined by a representative like in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who was a candidate for the first time and who, in his presentations, was mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that candidates will cooperate together and constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," added Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest leadership experience in both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends to want to change the regulations to draw."
"It can cause a blockade again in the General Assembly."
"I hope the right reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can tell whether the entire leadership of football will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among others the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and sought a variant to take part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sport Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parties within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state allocation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sport Union that must determine the management of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no proper candidate.
If the head of footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not have campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik said to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT, which would previously be favoured for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event of his election he would hold this position as President until 2013 in the year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be an embarrassment, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of the ill-fated reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position as President.
"If he had won, the present state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favourable for football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks him is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club."
In case Paclik triumphed at Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik prior to the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thought the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Board of Referees with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took as an example his ability to lead private firms and also led Plzen's club last year with his support last May his first division triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture."
"I would stop the influence of certain interested groups that tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to bad taste situations," Paclik added, who does not seek his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobby power over high-level policies would enable more money to be obtained from gambling tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If this is about gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass my Plzen Club actions on to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end the path situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that, if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to disputes about the electoral settlement.
Jablonec's official is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success of today's football show should calm this guerrilla party before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised to devote itself to national representation and financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday to have a President."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead in the Association," he added, but it is primarily linked to the club in Jablonec, worked for a large number of years at the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw."
"If there were not all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," says Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as a personal mission and I am ready to take all his responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then, it is said, he tries not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his legal training and that he knew correctly that his candidate opponent would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has evolved into football for a year and has already had some success."
"But his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent, but he said, faithful to his proclamations in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football window.
"And I would also strive to complete all the affairs that begin with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all football," said the Czech Press Agency CTK on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of football would bring no change in people.
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he told Strahov where there has been a understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are planned catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there's only one point of disagreement on how to vote on the third round we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there is a new leader in its head," says Pelta optimistically two days before the day probably determining for his career as an employee.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association to the General Assembly of Thursday, that would not please many people, he said.
However, Rajchl promises that in the event of his election we will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the Executive Committee members responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by Predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member will deal with a specific domain."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football takes a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others" he added.
He pointed out, they say, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth it and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have also said to me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, they say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great deal of work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them.' he expressed with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"After him there are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"You can blame me for a number of things but certainly not to bear any."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy about it not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Chechnya.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other mora whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Morave teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber that has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," Rajchl said, who is considering among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiation of contracts with television and the gambling law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he said of Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thought that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can question Plzen that he has done a superb job this year."
"If he were elected he would certainly continue in what was begun by Hasek and would not make a remarkable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
One jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Pataugeories in ovni optics, beautiful pools in Budapest: When travelling across Europe, you can experience its blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - you can let your tired legs rest in gas-water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool we can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cups, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the Art Nouveau meticulously restored of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool enjoyed it, she immediately noticed in her notebook all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and have presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain".Münich's covered swimming pools, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
She led her "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fervent of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans should just look at blue tiles and accommodate themselves from the Javel water well while the joggers breathe perfume from spice forests or can listen to the park's joyful bird gassing.
"I wondered one day why the pools must in fact always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive into a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but reflects on the other side the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, multicolored tiles, tremples.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (caver bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, swimming pools heated in the open air from Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in sight, you can admire the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits the swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
The smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a sulfur odor, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscsaba, is a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor swimming pool of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded land.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
By taking a look through the window of the New Art building in red-white-yellow, she observed the expansion of the weeds between the tiles.
She observed a opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only neo-Roman elements that come from its design in 1844 but also a marble room in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has been the favourite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to melt construction styles so different in such a formidable unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to have consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuate this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the organisation of consumers Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Scholarships on global raw materials, pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign actually aligns itself with the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that the bets have detached themselves from offers and demand - and take advantage of the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism from the US competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No matter is worth putting the Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake."
According to information from SPIEGEEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors should be presented - with a recommendation, usually.
By the end of January, the Head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly dramatic way that today's banks are damaging to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be especially under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the Group's CEO wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning the controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about -- his successor will worry about it.
One in two would resiliate the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
Up to now more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also benefit from the personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would resiliate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials.
43 per cent would discourage such a bank from being around them, 49 per cent responded that they would reflect on the cancellation of their account to change their bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
It is now opened again and is held as an exhibition house.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its vivid and bold allures and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the flag of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction of steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to date.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder house of BMW and its adjacent bowl-shaped building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station in southern Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for as long as contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and increasingly collapsed.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, now known as "Maison du 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at every point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among others in his youth as an artist skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she has carried out particularly the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, she has obtained private public funds and sponsorship and established the exploitation of them.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict surveillance, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht with sensitivity and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had "shown practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He was familiar with the original project, and he was aware of the problems of the building, which lost generosity and lightness as a result of his journey to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffre in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel slammed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origins have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Several materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and that also enjoy the protection office monuments," said Kristanitz, and he drew attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is the newly planned "central station headquarters" with offices and apartments.
And another chance will perhaps happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Kristanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the centre of temporary Berlin art, and as he says, she already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a million winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million extra this year in this regard.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of about 300 million euros would be expected until 2015.
This should enable better vehicle and rail network availability also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the denial of rail and dock facilities is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear snow and ice docks until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Head of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference on train accidents that also took place this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of "users," because it lacked, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years to do since it has to check the axles of the ICE trains significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central railway station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties to the USA.
After Chief Josef Ackermann's case there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant in the sector is catching up in addition to the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (€106 million) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA's financial market regulator carries a series of charges to large banks, and it has prompted cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution in this regard, without the parties entering into court proceedings," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognize any errors.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large separate banks and in the summer he signed before JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit homes are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at present it is raining on American banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 large international banks, the two US state real estate financier Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for in-kind advantage in mortgage cases of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to appeal to the FHFA, which is a number of operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a precise amount.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance gurus, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, American big investor Warren Buffett constantly explains how to invest in IT computing companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read IBM reports and changed his view on investment in this sector.
It had already to be understood much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and IT systems for other companies' IT sectors.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a cavalry attack in the world of finance.
As a result, IBM TI activity is granted the right to now call itself "Monsieur IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed to the CNBC economy that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time put on IT profit services as "exploitation of accounting centres".
The pioneer of computer technology, older than 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation as well as very efficient business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in businesses that he understands business.
But instead Buffett is attacking the rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a whole range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Mück Munchois.
This 81-year-old octogenary had resumed in the 1960s" the little textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built it in the rank of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, its lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares increased by one percent in the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be born again.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population respond with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that was believed to have been dead for a long time has re-appeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this far-right extremist context against the Turks.
There has never been a question of xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions that are far from predictable.
"This is a return to the bloody ideology," "Tel was the title of the internet posting of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right slum.
It was reasoned that the Turkish community had reacted in Germany: this weekend she called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of Brandenburg's door.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a story of success.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a gif: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German version of the "Hürriyet" does not prevent it from taking advantage of unique conditions.
"this starts to stink," Tel is the title of the chronicle of Ahmed Külahci.
It points out that people would have been killed, paid taxes and made an important contribution by their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
Police action was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious circles of the far right, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows itself ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be framed, it will remain for migrants nothing but self-defence and arms."
"this will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says Selen.
This means that if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, upon which mistrust and distance through acts of violence might result.
However, the attacks have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turkish people has been with the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of further clarification and re-evaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The U.S. has nearly failed in the financial and skating crisis in the meantime from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
It's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, in July, he was known to occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber welcomed publicly, greeted Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recent solidity and made pleasant comments about future colleagues.
"The U.S. has succeeded the Turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all the Bank's security systems and had burned up about €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the U.S. Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is considered to be suffering - and everyone is asking: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administrative presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more economics professor and President of the bank, and he would certainly have needed an adaptation period.
Suddenly he assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which had just proved once again that it had long earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
Indeed, the UBS is on a huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other side, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saves the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and strong, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we ask ourselves: how could I simply have been deceived at this point?"
He's been very wrong.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later, we noticed why he left.
The division of the bank had burst with sub-prime documents and had to cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over it.
For this she did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have broken the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed by silence, to the point that we never even learned its name.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, this got worse.
The bank had to announce again billions of losses, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second most paid board in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy, in view of its investment errors, and must be saved by the State.
The National Bank has redeemed the UBS from tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds to shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We haven't been able to save the U.S. once again," said the bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster it followed the second.
A few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and had declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, which may have cheated the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unwarranted profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS published more or less that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client money.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a little return to calm, and as one thought, that the UBS would succeed, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single market in title stands at 1.7 billion euros, before the bank only realized anything turned round.
And published: with risk management in investment bank, this still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it was found that the control of risks has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Thus the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the control of the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long served, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unstoppable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still going to match with the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings are prestigious here, shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's are found here among the stores of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the palace of Crédit Suisse to private elite banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another out of the market - or betrays the two big Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become too large, it would have found - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And yet, for a long time, they have adapted to the cores of Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the gap: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants began the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more heavily internationalized.
At the same time, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascension of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who broke a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffle would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remember the leaders' meetings in which the Wuffli Group leader has always spoken the same slogan: detach Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at that time documented the success of banks.
After all the U.S. wanted to climb all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
However, the business advisors, who were responsible for this, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The U.S. would have gaps in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS was thrown into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
As a result of growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed the value documents based on US mortgages - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a long time to go down.
"In the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the U.S. bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The more the euphoria is the greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far become bank.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to (yet) go so far.
But the investment bank must be vigorously atrophied, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only supposed to be transient when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: he had to carry on the affairs of the UBS, announced on Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
The U.S. needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly until now only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart horns spread in cities
In many places, brakes are considered "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have been no longer hunting cities for a long time.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The cornellas have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of animal dirt and noise.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first symposia ostfriesch on the cornellas, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt down the brakes of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected brakes: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, arranging and slaughtering typical cove trees made bird life difficult.
The cornellas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 cove couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the north-west of which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the massacre of the cornellas in this region.
Critics found bird capture in traps and killing them with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the outcome, is useless," noted the city planner and the landscape at Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or either cutting the trees, often causing undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the big colonies divide and they disperse elsewhere."
The event is only imaginable in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not to be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Leer Mayor Wolfgang Kellner.
Conceivable is a combination of the passing of animals with a perverse conditioning and tight offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens envisioned "of information panels in place of slicers" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-road-educational of the baskets at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs reporting on the life of these very intelligent brakes.
In the meantime, this project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the noise criticism caused by birds: "Here are a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freques do not only use labor instruments to reach a ruler but they themselves manufacture their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists at Cambridge University tested four brakes recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds occurs.
In one experience, birds quickly learned that they had to make a squawking with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they clearly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning cornellas then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their goal with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of iron available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were achieved from the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo casts Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks were unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Conducted by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal ran against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected, after the game's 0:0th, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the match back eliminatory by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first sleeve (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
There was also no more burning in the 0:0 zero match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1.0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) scored the other shots for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11 meters-pennality played by the hand (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a double shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted with a red-yellow map (54e).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup eliminations in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadium from Luz to Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a free shot of 30 meters in advance into the jersey.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her qualities of shooting at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour had nothing to do, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English championship, initiated a headball directed down the cross-bar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek has set a goal for Czech
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the punishment of Bosnia, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark awarded a 11-metre-long payout to the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic has surely diverged.
But after the break, the European vice-champion in 2004 succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts for the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had a chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goal keeper Petr Cech has prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Czech shot.
After the pause, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world class guard of the Czechs already shot again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to go beyond 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his seat on the EM third-party bench in 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round at the end of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62th minute, the legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first MS participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already managed with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) equaled for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence has prevented a possible goal of the prime minister.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of the goal guard Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will lock the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in Chinese in the coming years and will double almost the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately $2 billion (EUR 1.5 billion) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," PDG Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global corporate software leader will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the 176 000 global SAP customers are located in this expanding country.
China's growth plans are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales figures to EUR 20 billion.
Last year, Walldorfer recorded an income of nearly EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently the management of software provider's business, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in Chinese for more than 20 years.
"Now, we want to expand our activities..." McDermott said.
"Our objective is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. It's entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Grief: An Intimate Story of World War I), it begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.
A tip to start: clean this page carefully and make it your brand-page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this Romanesque account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the flames of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It includes some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like". There are the "feels, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young students and botanists to escalators, through doctors, ambulancemen and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, get crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives flow here like the storks of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones come to light.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
He refutes the idea that the First World War is only about the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are in the dark; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tset-tset flies are an intrepid problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of such people as a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, who can bear the cordite.
When shots of cannon lie far away, and you are a mother in the home, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English feeder within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are drawn mainly from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them address deprivation and the ability to succeed.
By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Coffee replacement, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes "the meat made of cooked rice in sheep's fat (and ends with a false wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wood footwear soles."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meats are recorded in sausage production. We also find 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse to wildness and says about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your heavy shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are ordered to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have an audience," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it's rather similar to "a man convicted in secret strangled."
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the beastry of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated mass and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butcher's shop while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviours as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and lie on the genital organs in the hope of ending the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a dead-end blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not hostile, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the manner in which the war "deceated exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "A l'owest no new", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I've read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, grasped from your hands this page where the list of people and burned with an allumette.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen as the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all hoards of a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few police officers I know and who were called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city was able to hold a lesson, so the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers used in particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the lowest number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages containing loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As Community Affairs Officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue curtains, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tent was hit before 1h45 said the Police, which allowed the occupants time to gather their business.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if any arrests were needed.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson for the Chief of the Police Department, affirmed that this measure had been taken only for security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was sharply held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the Police moved west across the thick business digs of protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and bags of leaves filled with clothing, teams of the department of sanitation followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the Police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people in the epicenter of the camp have hung up together.
Finally, two people joined trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "problem with public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "it wasn't in charge of operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
The barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a pastry of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Almost 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen cracking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a tip of plywood popped up by flying the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The School Aids Union continues the city for dismissal
The union representing hundreds of school aids who lost their jobs last month plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged students.
The prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, part of the city's underpaid people, lost their jobs last October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these redundancies to political revenge for not allowing the city to have access to a health care fund led by groups of workers, which would have closed the budget gap in the last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott stated that redundancies constituted part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied that school leave was not specified in the budget.
The Council officers of the 37th District stated that they would complete a claim notice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference would be organized on Wednesday to officially announce prosecutions to the State Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Walcott and the city education department will be the defendant's party. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of which are black or of Latin American origin, like most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would focus on the number of redundancies in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhood schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of students live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "This is not a dead parents' neighborhood that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student registration.
The union also claims that high school directors could be misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, even though "overrun" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty parent coordinators have been fired" and "not only because of overcrowding".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of uprising in Libya.
There will have been a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gadhafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, legislators of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress is upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgency in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20th.
NATO's mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution " commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "complains the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Commission Chair Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, this week, the House has to vote on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congressional Republicans, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or in the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to have their amendments approved, but this is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to wish their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August required the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is continually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of States are opposed to them.
As keen as members were to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The cadence slows down from the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the end to Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and said he wanted first to get back to the Congress.
When he appeared in the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show tackled its difficult return following the bullet that fractured its skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "better."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special 20/20 edition, which was released on the eve of the release of the new couple's book "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special program tracked Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, it is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on the front.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "what."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: is the Representative being seen singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she stopped her and asked for the first time about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and vigorously dealt with pending trial.
"There were many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At his recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"Then I'd say, "Gabby, you haven't been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The mob in a claw-claw stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The soldiers, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund-raiser.
A military high-grade at the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, the head of the U.S. Army Staff, was also involved, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," the military high-grade wrote in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they declare a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of bad spirits."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant parts of the country.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface" said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who asked him to pass the interviews would ask in a subtle way whether he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the topic of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arose, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
Victory is rarely congratulated by a country as unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct advantage from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," says Lieutenant-General Retired David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people focus largely on the depth of a military's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces Growing Pressure Against Rapists · Global Voices
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The 1st-class Elizabeth Lyman soldier was 25 years old and pregnant for 11 weeks on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having had dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," Elizabeth Lyman said.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, thrown her on the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will eagerly await the judicial decision during a historic trial to take place in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against the former secretary to defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rapes within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number was 28 months later - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and also claimed that the army did not investigate, pursue or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking on the galloned soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders."
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be involved in future prosecutions.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
Judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, known as Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to combat, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two-thirds of their lives in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are under way in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for having claimed to encourage a misogynous atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of " personality problems" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans' Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits to persons reporting that they had been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
In March the report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police about the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start getting contracts, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, "This was not his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Whether Lyman and other complainants will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the doctrine Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of dissuasiveness posed by responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he says.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favour, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy with his online anti-immigration opinions.
Monday, Breivik, who recognized that he had been caught in a murderous rage in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
As Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of his time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Sign in to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report published by the DEMOS think group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer an inquiry. The questions were about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to interrogate 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and politologists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love", publications on walls and status updates.
With over 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works the site's name appears in almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never let you in," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chance of being alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, states Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not in another case be recognized."
Facebook also consistently accesss the information of its users.
The team of the website that handles data has studied statistics on the situation in love and Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (through information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing will replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": First appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I am sorry, because you are holding your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I know the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during this monologue because "he did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Brevik in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks very closely.
About 30 surviving parents and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in hopes of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally got a bit advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than of an entire group of radicals, which may be comforting to some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's relative.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died last October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease letting them think that a genius idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a genius idea from a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds".This series traces the computer's birth, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the interview with Crengely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It is only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This slightly up-to-date video is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who's known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to exhibit technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurgences, where he seems to be eager to hear Crickey's questions, kicking him to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers to be good or bad for other companies and talks about his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he has learned to run a company:
"During all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because we have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one is deeply thinking about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by detailing his efforts to simplify accounts at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - we often start with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour in the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and telephone free of charge in long distance.
The device was the subject of numerous writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an appropriation is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, by calling and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while circling as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things a half a dozen times and you yelled at the public phone and it came to you a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We did not know much both, but we learned to invent a little thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever exist without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour he and Wozniak developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by passing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go mad just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with the technology (and launch of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, hunting the spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the yearbook and gave him a wire hit.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first office computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head shot.
At the beginning of his career, while he settled to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of finished devices.
Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... they yelled at me by pretending that it would take me five years to make a mouse that would cost $300." I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Eighty-ten days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15, which would be incredibly reliable.
On large companies that blow up:
Long before Apple was revived, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say that you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copyer or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] end up leading companies and product specialists are excluded from decision making.
The product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made her current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat out of victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved themselves the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets in private to examine the question of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's law on health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event was on Thursday last, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a trial by 26 States challenging the reform of ambitious health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 a.m. is expected in March, and the outcome will likely be of a nature to foster the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as the general solicitor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The Legal Office of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Enterprises (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and declared opponent of the health law.
The guests star at dinner, Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon Code 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund collections from law-related and other organizations even though the judge cannot be an intervener, a guest of honour, or appear on the program of such an event."
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in close proximity to two of the lawyers' offices of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has been enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This ethical violation and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who have cases before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming that they mix the court's affairs too easily with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative high profile activist.
In addition, conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan has a problem with ethics, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor for the administration of Obama when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-course line aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated to be over $1 billion.
There's nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order of 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is quite a matter when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Also incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a rising gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-coulions.
This Pharaonic order was passed by the Dubai-based Emirates airline.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Station that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to 26 billion dollars.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have an immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so detrimental to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The control of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the large carrier aircraft market and assists in curbing the competitor Airbus's attempt to impede with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautical fair comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is reversing its beginnings to increase its growth following the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister clearly beats the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her rival Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers promoted one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race at the position of governor of that state of the west.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they took ballots, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was in the lead polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in charge of governorship, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the Presidentials of 2012 for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any link with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the PAN was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán look like, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indistinct eye" and reported that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore whoever can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point but it is not sheltered."
"So if China and India can help, nothing can stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has been dangerously raised in arrow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has caused the fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has raised the call for the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would provide all Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the US financial rescue fund obligations, the European Financial Stability Fund - would offer greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a cut in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to make Europe's 1.2 billion Indian aid, of which at least 800,000 live with $2 a day, or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and leave on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area was likely to cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" because of the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic shift and major capital flows.
The Pentagon's Warnings on Potential Reductions of Defence
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and triggered a financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but fears now that an additional $600 or more compressions will be imminent if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a resulting budget agreement in what is called kidnapping would result in 23 per cent reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"An equally important reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects inoperable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continue Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing the salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defence.
"The result of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon in the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or an appeal to avoid the Pentagon's reduction, remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself reached the highest position in the Pentagon cumulating years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, poorly prepared and unable force to face potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the shed, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Identify a Lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how widespread deception and lying are in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for Herman Cain's presidency is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of parjure for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone stating to the American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Celebrity Anthony Weiner went for an idiot by quickly issuing lies contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former candidate for President John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extra-conjugal liaison.
And then, none of the people who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of trickery at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers gave the test responses to the students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times within the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, let's say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've got you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on lying have been demystified.
The liars look into your eyes.
They don't blush, wrinkle, or they don't always get upset.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified liar can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of answer.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
The good liars are able to read well others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extravertists lie more than introverts, that men say more "centered" lies about them while women say more "centered" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than non-married people (but the lies they tell tend to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty to lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's mind?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting reference data".
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him kicking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these signs as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, look at a way out, change posture significantly, or present a relief from "post-interview" - a exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
The interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
So be careful with your vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson evicted using the past while pretending that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceivers can also use a distant language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat completely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual rather than factual response and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be hijacked after the threat of late US approval
A few days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - triggering the anger of the unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to the rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will also gain approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Perbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the Department of State's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, from vast groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State would probably have pushed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six States.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have focused on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan pressure that a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the department's general inspector ordered a separate survey of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor atHillary Clinton in 2008, would be a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a defuse of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl at the point where she threw up her fear.
The lead of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month-old little Geneviève Monk, to the point that she suffered " personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10th last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher's wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their Riverside boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle angrily warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "what you say or think doesn't interest me."
She became angry and began using jurors - the word "" and the word """ of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to sprinkle water from the bottle.
She said that at this point Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings that led her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she got sick, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but did not get any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims for unspecified damage, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family is planning to donate all the money received to charity for children's cancer.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed down the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in return there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing billionaire losses for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on ice-cream allocations from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main affected crops were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in State unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of the year, an accelerated increase was observed, as during January to March 55 thousand 053 signalers were unemployed, with a 4.53 per cent rate of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, an increase of more than 74 thousand signalers unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money-laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an unlawful way, it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and to use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, to the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty in getting work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment increase," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market is compounded by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works without being employed in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for delaying the state is low wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much less than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from declining economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reached $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,43 thousand,312 in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, in July, the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3-billion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600-billion-weight and no debt in any sector of the State economy was observed until November.
Responses
For employers' representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrated a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has had to align the effort of everyone and above all the good already synchronized walk of this new government team, hopefully next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year ice-cream have retained the economy of the state and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn't turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the National Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be detonated," he says.
Much to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that better channels the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas of economic development, there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has made progress in the management of public policy.
"There are things that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot, and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
One resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the convicted small dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health crimes, in his variant of possession of marihuana for sale.
Pursuant to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officials on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was circulating in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and in the copilot's place a small back bag where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Contributions to works
Social works included in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He reported that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and up to now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have not given us anything, even though since July they have to give us a share," he says, "and we, in order not to register delays, we have started the works and we have made much progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to function, and this year, in order to gain access to these programmes, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he explains.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management to enable the corresponding percentages to arrive as quickly as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have given us nothing."
The Court valid "the analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has detained the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog coupure" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary for the invalidate were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was discontinued for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a legally reserved attribute to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and by accepting complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his statement, the President-in-Office said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures to prepare the public administration through general standards.
"I also believe that if it were done, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of state management.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years and this results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more chains.
To adjourn the change, he said, would adjourn the benefits of digitisation which involves a decision of public interest which does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, comprises a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the Faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and they had done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, it ensures.
The possibility of a "vote per vote" count is analysed in Michoacán
According to PreP's evidence, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality with regard to the election trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the PEP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards for federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either his Constitution Political and his Electoral Code of State or his Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the Congress of State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted his publication within the time limits provided for by the Act of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Authority and called the vote of the State's representative for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it does not have the right to "sanction or contest them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the urn file is not in the president of the ballot; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all polls of the election may be realized when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the respective election and the one who has obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total score of the polling may also be realized if at the end of the joint score it follows that the difference between the alleged winner and the second-place candidate is equal or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition by the representative of the political party whose second-departure candidate will be excluded from the electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial instalment.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without accounting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the sierra of Zapalinamé, confirm the family.
The remains of Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday to the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of requiem.
According to his family, the last desire of the Lieutenant-Colonel was for his ashes to be spread in the Sierra of Zapalinamé.
After the other people died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the board of an aircraft from the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Mars.

"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his ashes were spread in the Sierra of Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant-Colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a wonderful father and son, an affectionate brother and cared for his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours, it was said to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who led Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.

Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadreyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from Cadreyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place noticed that in the property, whose closing was beige and coffee, the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three metres away, they located the bodies of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered elsewhere, because no dolls were found in situ.
In the closing of the property there were legends directed by one crime group organized to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured at Cadreyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who was part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first event on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of his liberty was saved.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on 12 November at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a follow-up journey to Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car with no registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
After and after these statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country on board the economic disaster.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the whole of Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn", he adds.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in less than normal time, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that are impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced us to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," told the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
PDL's support, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the government of the technocratic majority that Monti has formed.
Parliamentary support
The new government in Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current Eurozone financial defences.
Monti said that his Government should continue until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will give it only time to implement the reforms before the elections go ahead.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process that is forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friendry, at 15:05 a.m., at Stade National de San José.
While national and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a broad register of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor has only the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the Panama match (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain an intense year-long activity in league and national coup championships and fights in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal guard Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, flying the brain of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenaries of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front-centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready from the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side of Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the drummer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not starting.
The historical editor of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that it will also be a dream to happen in this country.
It is that the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
This day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcription is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far this has been great.
I spent only once in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it thrills us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that so long it had to go to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we have had during the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We offered a two giant shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that this set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing ourselves.
We love this country, we like to surf and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places for surfing; this is how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you had great shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What does that owe you?
I think this is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to recount our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is a great source of emotion.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very friendly with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerged from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw at Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that came up.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music of each other, and that could not go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what has brought it, without focusing on the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we did not publish a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There have been a lot of frustrations for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think to the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it has always been a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose him for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group that we loved most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunt relevant despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if relevant now, I believe it is wonderful, because it is a music worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, these things are starting to influence your art and your music and these songs, probably represent this for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori Re-hospitalized for Medical Examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, he informed his family physician.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, stated for TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of retribution for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
Four times of language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first few years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official cortège, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda issued by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French representative Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most emerging and developed countries in the world, and has in force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to deploy the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TAC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustach lead moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, indefatigable, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the cries of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at shops around the world, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of the existing titles.
Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to make a "second turn" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "to succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo has a look at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the mustach plumber must go through platforms mined with perils to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find new features in movements, environments, costumes and enemies as well as in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$70 million.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country which claimed Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had brought about all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done entails an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for diverting Q120 million funds from the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 youth at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, the long-term number of jobs obtained by this social group has been achieved.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping untrained people, without work, with problems of substance abuse or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Aside from the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the current municipal eco-socialist Richard Goma attended the event.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Chief Charity Officer of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the large Hall of Fabra i Coats.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that today is also a very difficult time, but he added that the work accomplished so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to be able to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Rue Balmes' number 51 lived ended.
Twelve people voluntarily quit yesterday at noon the building they were occupying illegally and where they organized micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, in judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock of the door was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From that day there will be access control," said the administrator.
The Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, except to paint the walls and leave residues there anyway, especially alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which gave up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the occupation of the building her business has dropped by 80%.
The disco owner mentioned that the property invaders made him unfair, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the disco they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the place of leisure had had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for noise, while according to the latter, the discomfort was not caused by the discotheque's clients, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties held there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritate neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since this "forgives him" rent.
The Urbana Guard (municipal police) also confirmed that in the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The mayor's president of the municipal PP group, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the common and civil life problems caused by the city's residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the Squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 a.m., the police moved to number 35 of Rue Mont-ral, after having received the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the polemic on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the former Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed the promotion posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large metropolitan Barcelona park.
In addition, it also contained a figure comparison with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park if not Yellowstone, with bleeds in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of the park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste of elite speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the rare opinions that coincide with three architects from Barcelona, professors of universities, who presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the one of the green house pulpes was not conducted at last.
"We must start from the base that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict the architect for which the title of "Collserola ports" contains a "lexic trap": they should not be considered "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, calls the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Hazards that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience experienced in the '80s and which had in the Forum area "song sound".
The first fear is the proper delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overstepping.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
With this in mind, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the side of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the exception that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he said) that we must create: "We architects, we should only be an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because the basis of the competition is lacking a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional contests - he says - in the sense of the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole".
This makes, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to impact in the program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the immediately higher band than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, a zone of equipment that performs a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and this will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Casino Red's legal power foundation granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the Royal Casino attack, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic quota so that Monterrey's mayor would allow the clandestine operation of the game house.
After the public denunciation, the prosecution opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of PANista and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Departmental Officer 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
It remained there for the following 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's agent had detained the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's penal center allegedly for having the owners of the Red Casino sang with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the mid-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine the guilt of Jonah, such as that of the 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the game house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of the Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who were associated with the playhouse had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim can be made for the proceedings against him; no compensation will be sought for the damages and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the play house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to San Nicolás de los Garza to report to Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other persons lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had various contact with the soil, the pales have had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so the unit met the requirements for the transportation of staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact zone do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact has appeared structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Majesional State operated at a speed of crossing and this happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information supports the assumption that normal operation will crumble at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the IACM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft moved towards the boundary area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were low-level layers of nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the nebulosity conditions the crew has sought a lower and more visibility area towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The aircraft's impact coordinates and the aircraft's last recording on the coincidental radar, probably prior to the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has occurred on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model suggests that the helicopter has hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of the disaster there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which bears the presumption that the impact took place in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetic protocol of obesity of children and adolescents' that will allow for the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate whether or not they are entitled to attend the IMSS sport units in Valle de México, where evidence is being made to minors every Saturday starting at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Sportive Unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independence (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that it is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It has detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weights, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight-taking in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that, in only six years, there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in boys and 47 per cent in girls; with respect to overweight, there was also a dramatic increase', the IMSS specialist stressed.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American hereditary status, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calorie), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which helps to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and avant-bras indicate the probability of suffering metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, each explaining the measures and changes in their lifestyle to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking over short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e., the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat paste with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid cassia
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signs that the pavement was solved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Mexico Valley, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement was adequate, the cases could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassia, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to that of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore, the formation of cassia.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behaviour.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid condition, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, adds it.
This means that in the streets, asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, consisting of small rocks bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the bed, he said, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, opined the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts on a last layer called bearing layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand, which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adherence to the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassia.
In the case of the formation of a case, he said, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage is not immediately occurring, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The National Research System member explained that the vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of cassia and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassia.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and help repair the cases easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What's missing to Valle's candidate to be Colombia's new miss?
Analysis of factors that have caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 of princesses.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with finding herself on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already sum 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Vision Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury to appoint the First Princess is the fact that she was not convinced with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literaria Leamos Carreta.
Here's the answer from the candidate in Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince" is quite a deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Châtiment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer did not please first because of the term "culturalizing" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each book cited it marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the assumptions initiated is that according to which Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that as the favourite, ovation and candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the Oster food challenge, the vote of the public for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "he woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the stage".
And it was noted in his first presentation in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the day before the crowning.
Even though she had found herself safe at the two parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program (On Home), of the RCN Canal stated that the fact that Melina had been designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prizes during the competition does not receive the queen crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Contest of Beauty.
For this reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough at a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on your social sensitivity, that before starting the competition you are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned by her shortcomings in her back and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The Queens' Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but his fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which was actually not too notorious for me, left him points on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considered that the mistake of the candidate for Valle was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgical is good, but Valle didn't know how to do it.
His body was never his asset and she was lost because of this."
For this prize, that the National Competition of Beauty for the first time, after the parade in bathing shirts came up a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Whether or not, the truth is that Melina is beginning today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopy writer went to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these staff members is crucial.
On November 4th, a Californian ITC dactyloscopy writer passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopes working in the local ITC offices, this week was the "availability" tour of Eliasar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often spent more than five days in the forest to reach the location where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e., palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano we had warned Eliasar to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the corpse, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because this one was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian wolf, ink, taker and lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man who came from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme head of the Farcs.
Searching for fingerprints
For a Dactyloscope writer in Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliasar González at a press conference for the operation against Cano is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we're doing.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can be crucial in resolving crimes.
Apart from identifying the corpses, the dactyloscopes support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Prints may also exclude or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
We recently found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it has been determined that a parent may be a suspect of the crime and indeed a mark on the bottle coincided.
Even if this doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it's on the crime scene.
One ITC dactyloscope explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to remove them.
Later, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the delicant database, or to the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how we show it in the CSI TV program.
Just as everything that shines is not gold, everything that you touch does not become forced into a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is made.
"Indignities" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were marching in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people went to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a judicial order, in Manhattan's place, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Grand Pomme Park.
Hundreds of protesters were marching in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allowed the 'indignities' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in place, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignities" to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited forced evacuation of the area and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the "indignities" occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some protesters, even though Bray was unable to confirm the actual figure, ensuring Efé because he saw some journalists who had also passed handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property area - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some protesters who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of this court order, and they even delivered it to the officers who were watching the scene, causing 'some small clashes', Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuate the members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg said in front of the press that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but he warned that local laws did not allow them to settle in with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to harm other people," because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn has been repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they do not think of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Noel TV program
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will go out on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improment", "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian Noel TV program.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (Baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will go out on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcasting of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary, supporting in a crib a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared like Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special program also features Canadian Bublé singer, who married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is not far from controversy himself.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "boot" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Reborn After Earthquakes
GDP increases by 1.5% through domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, still convalescent after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the Japanese country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have diminished.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at the annualized rate.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to a decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use gaps for zero croitre.
Japan has woke up mainly as a result of the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" elected by investors who fled the debt crisis in eurozone and the disturbing forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a plaque in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic flow line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, took responsibility for their weak results between July and September for the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue to sit in EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower custody.
"We have to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are impeded.
Because this one has dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 points in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, n lowering eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens feed doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to sink into the labyrinth leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Government of Hell's Transition is imposed rather by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his designation could be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date, that of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not reveal any doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything more."
The conservative leader went one step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that have to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to making adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the entire Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock help if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenistic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "preponderant" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become the world's second donor in the last two decades with regard to this instrument of cooperation, whose " essence" is that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday, with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one whose purpose is to reduce the volume of people living with income under one dollar per day, to which the "soil of poverty" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "reached many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families come from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path begun a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, pointed out Queen Sofia as a "act of due justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought her the qualified "family leader" from the "poor banker" to Valladolid.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, has warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit implies "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to "exclusive people whose door is closed"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates contaminated with the solidarity spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the programme, but it was imposed in the fall, in particular to satisfy the militants who judge the government's policy too laxistic towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted in almost unanimous form.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European Minister of Finance, left no doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellor - and the motion - holds in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected a overwhelming majority of the proposal to weight each country's weight to the European Central Bank's director, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced Germany's weight.
In order to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in a hurry to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for shit.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does the disease arrest fraud represent?
After allocations, the UMP and the government launch the disease arrest offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November, in Bordeaux to visit a fund of family allowances, and to deliver a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and the assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less adjunct to an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for the purpose of fiscal savings: the government is planning to impose a fourth day of shortage on private employees before a stoppage is taken over.
Clearly, without specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could lead to anger, but which would bring EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic in scope: to impose an unpaid day of shortage in the event of termination of work (they so far do not have a time limit of deficiency, compared to three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also relaunching the issue of fraud, targeting this time the abuse related to the workoffs.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will pay back," warned Xavier Bertrand on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of the frauds at work.
It has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offensives since 2002, most often bearing their fruit.
The French are no more sicker than they are in Europe.
Let us first look at national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in the Economy of Health, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And so 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management Site, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any days to stop illness.
Another study, this time of Sick Assurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to work.
A lengthy study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Disease arrest fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it has only a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes controls systematic on disease arrests of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term arrests were "injustified or too long", or 37 050 cases.
In the case of arrests over 45 days, which were systematically controlled, 11% were "inadapted or unwarranted" of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 "unjustified" cases have been reported for several million employees who have had a disease arrest.
A figure that represents very little in front of, for example, that of working in black.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax-earning loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to them.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, before Parliament, said on Monday, November 14, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"In order to continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos planned that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, provided Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's deputies, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste, but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said an expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to that end.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts have participated in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when required, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "death medicine in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die at the hospital.
Overall, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is no need to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, which have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on individuals who are not competent or who are not consenting.
On the contrary, yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-sponsor of the report, more cases of these overflows would be found in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in Support of euthanasia
Let us recall that 85% of Canadians have already expressed support for euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or the disabled have less value.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate that 41% of them should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts signatory of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill people.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands or Oregon.
King of Jordan calls President Assad to leave power
Ladies denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar al-Assad supporters showed yesterday in front of the Foreign Affairs Department's premises.
The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, which are neighbouring Syria, took a stand for the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "quit power" in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had in his heart the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country near Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey adopt an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesperson for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OHCHR).
Two other civilians perished "the exchange of shooting and piloting at the heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs' besieged city, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem felt that the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's work, which he said was a "hazardous step".
Syria "does not flech," he added, ensuring that "the horrendous plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "Civil Protection Mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also supported the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which he believed is contained in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities against the protest and release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, judged yesterday the Arab League's decision "inaccurate", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded a little time from the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should establish a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, after having met with the President of the designated Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the obligation yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that markets will be patient and understand".
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister appointed should be a team with primarily technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, when it comes to the next legislation, it has been estimated.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself, once he has come into office, to work urgently and for the purpose that Italy "becomes the protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, inter alia, new measures to be rigorous.
The Italian patron saint Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "for a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and another "Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place EUR 200 billion of state obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, widely based in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and was reportedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact Iran's embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system "has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has declined or progressed slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 per cent, against a 13 per cent increase in Catholic violence, a 4 per cent decrease in anti-Jewish crimes and a total increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by differences in race and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," the human rights organization First emphasized, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he added, thinking that this could happen by improving police reports on hate crimes.
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more clearly, live the activity of the other "Twitos", the netizens who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast all over the network Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its low instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rediffuse a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiators, thus opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users discussed tweets based on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it's too much like Facebook," says @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Registration of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of a large-scale Social-Democrat/Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible degradation by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign note (triple A).
It is the Social-Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only by a single skull, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion extra interest each year," said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area member countries of 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are close to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to raise public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we find excessive volatility" at the yen's exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 in front of the green note.
But the yen has been regularly rising since, led by buyers who regard it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was spent on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro came down under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This sharpness of the Japanese currency is harming the exports of the archipelago because it has increased the cost of Made in Japan products and reduced the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr.Noda who feared that this increase in the yen would not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in the exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the yen's quest did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary relaxation was to wait for Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its Treasury bond purchases by 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) to the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Rates rise, Stock Exchanges flung
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the higher growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue to rise.
Always concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges sink a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10h, CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions over the yields of euro area countries' borrowings in difficulty, market shares around the world continue to make some of their recent gains ".
"Nerve investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended by 0.7 per cent, in turn suffering renewed concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is $1,3570, which is up to 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates for Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian bonds at 10 years of age reached 6.85%, the performance of the Spanish securities at the same age 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has claimed time to the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the line of looking at markets, while on Sunday there are legislative elections in the country.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
In terms of statistics, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than 0.3% expected, brought by consumption of households.
The Insee, however, reduced the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries the economists most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must take it to the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or at the end of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear is taking.
The debate will be successful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a need to slow down fossil resources to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate deregulation, a deadlock in the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
For this reason, Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a source of replacement, or of Switzerland, which just intends to build last generation plants.
In contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but one, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by resume construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to the speech.
Berlin's choice will result in an increase in the electricity price, an energy dependency exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all of these ugly effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
The European Windsong, of which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; therefore, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a electricity bill of more than 40% than those of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would result in a significant increase in the electricity price, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
It should be recalled that our country's energy policy has built an industrial sector of 125 000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exportative, it leads to a galaxy of specialised SMEs in international markets and makes them very creators of non-replaceable jobs.
If France had decided to step out of nuclear power, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the annual 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a sad skin.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to run sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of miracle electricity production, no more diabolical.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable CO2-emitting solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have a security authority in France that exercises intransigent and transparent control over the existing power stations as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are living in the same security obsession.
In a half century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, has intervened in normal operating conditions; it has remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamenville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to seize leadership in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various ways - the embroiderment of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (Libération of May 23) proclaiming at the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masonry and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed in economic terms.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
To the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac in 1976 who stated that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot receive all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared on both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande draws attention to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migratory problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paying electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemies growth and sleeps at work.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may substitute for national workers, especially those with low qualifications, exerting a downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, exercising for the most part trades in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of natural immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less-expenditure revenue) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets for his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, while dissuading immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece over the 20th century.
Some could believe that it would be enough, in order for democracy to permanently triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even become a "enstrument of oppression" as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy needs much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe we live in is an economic crisis, but it is a crisis of politics and democracy at first.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum would have had in this respect a double value: that of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump attached in the emptiness of the nationalist replica: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but we do want a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no way to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that leans on the dictatorships of the markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent task is to restore the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long time of fighting against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Seven.
But thinking about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to do the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economicly integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"Without contact" card cards are generalized
The world lounge of the chip map opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most portent segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to settle your purchases by simply approaching a card reader.
This year, 460 million non-contact chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to make further progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the overall chip card market (6.925 million cards).
In the long run of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for non-contact payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa were deployed.
But the big surfaces put double-walled.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
In order to move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French establishments have committed themselves to systematically forward to their customers bank cards that are equipped for contactless," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But this is only a first step towards the way of payment of the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real expansion next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the marketing of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
For a long time, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired" about it.
"The way the two organizations operate and reports from the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have updated the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day while several of their captors were engaged in an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the fallout of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a man who says that he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is an advance, but it is probably necessary to wait for more formal evidence before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from the outside world and that it has become increasingly active," Tempère Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and of the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, therefore urged Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminators with little interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in north-Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia while its activists engage in the fight against the impie central government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active, multiplying the attacks on the police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests in the city, we count to 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is still in Abuja, where he gets into the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now worrying all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information" .
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied the tone-declarations and shortcuts to foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsupported - are gone.
Mitt Romney, the best place in the race at the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese in front of the WTO and challenge them "to manipulate their currency", a theme bearing in an America exasperated by the migration of whole fish from its industry to Asia.
So much if this must involve the triggering of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to Obama in China and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to strangle himself in the face of an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In Reagan's image
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions failed to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's gone for good."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him an embarrassing ignorance of records.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the early departure of Iraq's "boys", on its tergiversations in Libya, thus placing a low label on it.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population is rather positive about the national security balance of Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been suspicious of the military interventions that lead to the decency.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to raise its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
The North Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with excitement.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new pipeline that directly links Russia to Germany.
Simbolically, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Netherlands counterpart Mark Rutte played together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the Saint Petersburg region to the Mecklenburg-Pomérania Land.
A second tube is due to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, i.e. the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has an air of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will actually deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossings by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of weakening energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has barely seen a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline in five years' time.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by Gazprom leaders, present in number at the gas arrival point in Lubmin.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine tube is made of concrete- won steel to protect it against the anchorage of ships.
It is based on the seabed, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mining fields from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to increase measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned for the outside of Sweden, but the project managers gave up when the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently settling off their coasts.
"In the event of damage, we stop passing the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas in the pipeline will therefore escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, driven by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of one meter in diameter, and is driven by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, he provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without any repairs.
The traffic of the gas is simply driven by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), together with the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, known as Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company, for 20 renewable years, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their own expense, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, which are 4.5 metres high, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas at every passing hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to remake the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskin book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, like oldies by time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a design note book but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (tupe skin) which designates a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Mode Mode.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait of the buyer because the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, accounts for almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from the Fnac to the small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition " Back" where architects or artists expose their own notebooks.
In August, she also launched a cover in Leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Enjoying its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer hoops... The brand is on a wide range of media.
A success that has made it exciting: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was redeemed by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskin.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouragement?
"No, points out Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities."
" The progress made for fifteen years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" However, there is still a great deal to be done. "
It must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled people before accessing employment.
They are rather older: 37% are older than 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that only complicate return to employment, which "constitutes the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the target brakes.
There remains the undit, the attitudes that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Engrepreneur Association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of the disability ", with " overrepresentation of wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities ".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, dated 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How happy"
Before fighting the Blues Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game gives them.
We're not going until we write that there was some conniving between them, but the image is symbolic.
Asses side by side on the opening of the auditorium at Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian picker only has praise on his subject.
"I am very happy with Eden, with its progress and because it is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," says the Lillois on his side.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it's a whole, if it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm here all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Householded against Romania Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
However, the notion of "pleasing" is not omitted.
The Blues, he has been encouraging them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This will necessarily contribute to further strengthening the "particular" nature of this meeting.
As far as forward, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We met at once."
"Being able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part mentioned "fertility".
"Ferté" to argue a gala match.
"Ferity" also to notice - as a "neighbor" - that France has "becomes a very high-level team" a little over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a tonner's job," if he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be very happy to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians get big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report on this in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimist its dam back to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
As he went, the two teams lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which it has been handcuffed since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to play.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seemed obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, certainly, but it has been unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we have not set a goal on the outside"
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience who should be there as boiling, even though the party is obviously "very tight", said a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012," the successor of Carlos Queiroz was still relativized.
The zero reported Friday of Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
No one can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we have not set a goal outside," regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put in a maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you show yourself realistic this time.
