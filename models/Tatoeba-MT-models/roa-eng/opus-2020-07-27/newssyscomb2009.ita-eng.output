The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both existing parties in the great coalition and this marked reinforcement of the right populist parties, led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5%.
Even worse it went to ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the Post-War and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which led to early elections.
Also at the beginning of July, when ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in the preferences in front of SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them for causing the government to sink.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers consider that Monday could already happen during the extraordinary convening of the Party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the electoral result, i.e. to renew the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populists (FPÖ) parties, they have gained 18% in advance and BZÖ 11% in votes, but the socio-democratic have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists have agreed with the populists to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from BZÖ) which was even reason for sanctions by the European Union.
On this development, Haider evidently plays, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also been able to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, coming down among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be resolved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of scarabs in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg would say, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then it would be a certain cooling," he noted after the meeting which took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere with legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was convicted and punished with a fine, the central government may negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a superior court.
Then he can ask for release on bail and wait for the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter into the matter is to provide the convicted with the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, in front of its partner, it stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and the accusation of these blind scientists a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question if he obtained a promise to deal with it from the Indian side.
"I have obtained relatively many promises," he only noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabeds
It is approaching the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it is the adjacent seabed.
At the same time, the area is as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN workers for issues about oceans and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech lawyer, director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and always adds something.
The desire to work and enthusiasm dominates.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms so far that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the land
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they adopt laws on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
The Convention has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a nutshell for continental platform we mean that part of the seabed and its ground which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits before the Committee on the Definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very wide technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and costly measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional aid.
The committee has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine properties, has recorded a global echo.
But New Zealand also earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to you by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear them in the future by the seabeds, as they promise themselves will be invaluable.
Other states will also submit their requests gradually.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean begins that the Convention has declared a common heritage of mankind.
No one has an exclusive position right now.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Fund is not Klondike," says the Director Mikulka exaggerating," with the fact that his individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it is shared with other states of the former Soviet bloc in the framework of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called pioneer investor.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is crushed, it's almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A division worker from Macedonia Rober Sandev carries a piece of evidence to show him.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help with the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are getting more and more detailed information on the circumstances of the release of the 11 hostages in Europe.
The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior have taken part in the rescue operation in Germany.
In addition to the army specialists, GSG9 units were on site, the federal avian police, the federal criminal office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesperson for the ministries reported on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans to join together as assistance directly on the spot.
"We haven't arrived fortunately," says a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Aggressors kidnapped a group of travellers in southern Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The released in the meantime have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release have not been explained.
There was no information in Berlin when they would be back in Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and the special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive Tuesday in Germany.
US House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress just failed the $700 billion rescue package for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell to the bottom.
With 206 entries to 227, the American representative house rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties there was no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been eliminated.
In one dramatic action the supporters desperately tried to persuade critics of the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived.
While the suffrage was in progress, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The investor's concern was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It took place before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, it collapsed again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it needs to have the benefit of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of reservations
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study the turnover on travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year has increased clearly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak conjuncture views, the desire to travel Germans is still strong.
On reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a plus of the turnover of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for tourism DRV in Berlin reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute's survey there are already increased booking quotas for the fall months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be about 11%, the DRV reported.
Presupposed for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyze the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develop statistical projections for the whole market.
It would also include travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak price of the dollar, claimed in particular would be travel in the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
In addition, travel destinations would be particularly popular in Germany, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as in Germany.
Especially the travels all included have a high rating, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individual holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for reservations made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before it would again be recorded a surplus of the turnover - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has gone down.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, barrel beer from a liter and vip in Dirndln griffati.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
You are blonde, television moderator and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, goes hand in hand: just 3 minutes to the Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves against us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this at my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how friends make each other.
The two-money Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to date remains within limits.
And then once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or the leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's grembule collects strange looks at the banana stand at chocolate.
A nun makes me notice that I would have wrongly tied the grumbling: "On the left you are free, in the center you are virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind widow."
I suddenly fix my bow from behind to left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirt techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which she leads "To Drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with showy inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooooo.".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, everyone thinks it's a pancake.
Bob is one of these notorious "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m. they walk white on the plaza of the party health care, which must be taken care of the poor beon
Nurses appear in white every time – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered bar in the tent.
This works as with most visitors of the Wiesn: it must be empty, it returns full.
Whoever lies under the curtain in this liquor box in the blood, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," yells one of my health and disappears in the coffin.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on the Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died soon after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on a careless charge of driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey attempted to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosforo, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Train Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in imperial play, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what today is Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence d'Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
British and ruling forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpassa station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone to the bottom, largely surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, they serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the increasingly larger diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the bedcar for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish deputy Suat Kinikilioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a slump race along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary movement in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more importantly in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by malls built and pastry shops of power, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kinikilioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure she also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign political party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "it doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out that almost everyone I spoke to here has recited in memory: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically go through those railway lines to the east through Asia and in the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentiles Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's mid-eastern ambitions can now be, in large part, in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to make claims on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nechrology, September 11th) had taken over the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful young choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21s, but at the time Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changeable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that the music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let it be music to speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and accurate, although never dictatorial or flowering.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a rider, a conductor would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he drove Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have dealt with more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in disagreement with only one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "horsed around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
It'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he began studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... at the same time studying for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This results from the Woodruff author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during that period he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his pictures in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength that they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda Supersellers
In November the Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
A refined mechanics must be added, which increases the comfort of driving and allows to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth reporting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow for increased sales in the segment.
So, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, by 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch is expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow the Honda to reduce sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company's managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 in less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, the Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The first months of the year are expected to launch the Insight commercial launch, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the interval is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, it also expands the living interior.
This advantage derives from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with double background - salt at 399 liters, i.e., 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine couple high in all its phases.
The 1.2 liter model enables the use of a power of 90 cv at 6,000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached the 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the bee flight, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this little robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the producer house.
During the flight, each water creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes composed of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insects to fly without interruption in their personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined as a location laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"At the moment when it detects a obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of an ape and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike an ape, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, and even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which they can turn its wheels and not exploit endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot could avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act by starting with this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instant prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be in the car series within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the typology with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in the path.
Trema before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging with mortgages in banks in dubious insolvency, they created a fun and informative game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credit"... or problems.
The third aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to lead to thinking not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do so, that is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more a page for teenagers than a website for the public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a songo room in the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of participation in the Company, which was received following a net decrease in its stock in Stock Exchange.
One week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would purchase the 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity securities at the individual cost of $25.25, which is a sum of $3 billion.
The established price is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average price of $29, or a percentage below its current course of 28%.
At 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley was down from 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to bank holding company," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should enable her to differentiate her actions, however, by passing it under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than the one previously taken.
The modalities defined Monday also show that in recent days the agreement was modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of her shares to the Japanese colossus for an amount equal to $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought that our share would be exclusively made up of ordinary actions.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter is traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow them to seize investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should then establish a Tier One solver ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said she had "clearly" lightened her budget from the end of August.
In recent weeks, the group has tested hard, which has seen half the value of its shares while the cost of risk insurance has suffered from an impensation.
However, on Monday it was at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the large investment banks of Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's survey, announced that he had earned $15 billion, in part from the Berkshire Hathaway, a group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa to Quito on Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism just in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, of the Bolivian Evo Morales et of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, the latter gave a voice to the project of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" on the referendum on the basis of votes of 80%, based on official results.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls were conducted at the exit of the elections and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, on the other hand, had claimed the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously", had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chavez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place quietly according to the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserved for it the "development planning" of a country that essentially lives on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to make use of this amendment and to propose its candidature for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freedom of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commander.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, about 15-30, on a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to release any press interview, to Maadi's hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to kidnappers," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoeir Garanna, on the runway.
Raped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this hostage group had been shelled from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four autists, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organization agency of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault at night shortly before dawn.
"We were shots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the manager who asked to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flight" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would have been supported by the German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we obtained this result, it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were located and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two of them.
According to the army the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the Sudan.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the first page a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current electoral campaign is concentrated.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life remains in shadow.
Who will speak out to denounce the wretched sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that starve?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and buildings?
That in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government paid three and a half million euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
At our neighbours in America, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all of this in common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies in Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archive and heritage heritage preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the very ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, which has been in difficulty for the first time in Europe for the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest in Hungary as well.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on the weekend agreed at the highest level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the problems in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of Fortis, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can constitute a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then presented themselves in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares on Friday fell almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank leaders this value is not real.
The corporate summit accounts for the collapse of the Fortis actions to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had already assured that investors should not be afraid to lose money.
The bank's clients did not panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of data on the purchase of medicinal products from individuals.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data of medicines depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies are subject to the insurance rate and the amount payable in case of health claims of any customer and if they consider the risk to be too high they do not provide for insurance.
The customer had to make a medical visit a while ago and the contract was concluded only after the exam was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code you can easily get information from the pharmacies on which medicine you bought in the last year and half and from this the program evidence of which disease and health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is in practice unregulatedly high and is classified into the highest risk category.
In trade there are several versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiplier, so there is not much left to the insurer in addition to paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
Amongst the contrary, some medicines are usable for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraine or heat vapours, but are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance point of view - commercially, applies as a risk increase factor, the first two no.
For the request and data processing, companies were formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, demand the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are obliged to do so even if so far they have not imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data and in parallel control of usage will be more and more difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a proposal for a law which gives control powers to companies specialized in the data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who trade above all together, the agenda for the ninth meeting at the summit has also been dominated by this issue, in addition to all other global problems.
Today, there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will focus on cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union acknowledges the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more should be given rise in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, Senior Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, that is to increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also take the path in the future.
India by the end of 2009 would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused attention on global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They have called for the conclusion of the Doha Round trade, even though both sides have played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it continues in the energy and climate programme, that is, it would like to reduce at least 20% by 2020 emissions of harmful substances.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global agreement should be concluded at the climate conference scheduled for the coming year and the production of greenhouse gases by 2050 should be reduced by 50%.
They also want to curb the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will be in the French capital today, where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors, the French companies will receive a commission worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmese, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt awaits for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry for Heritage and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally present with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting will follow with the press at the Room Struktur in Buchmesse Hall 5.0: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and young people, is gradually reduced.
Caught Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire missing a year ago
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying into the Nevada desert.
Ruts were found on a 3000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after viewing the wreck, which then identified the equipment: this is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash money and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world's ride on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had been flying around the world without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters high above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the patterns with an original design and well defined by decided lines, large surfaces and net corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born among the "compacts" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a lot of news in this sector.
For its content outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the showsrooms Mercedes-Benz from the next 17 October.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project of maxi-fissiones, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the very central Via del shopping Milanese, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car is out of the manifesto.
Afterwards, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
Mercedes with this advertisement is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype field of automotive communication.
Will it be possible with this formula to stun the interest of future buyers? We shall see.
Here's who the Italian hooligans are.
From the Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy now is ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following for years the Azzur National and so far, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor was he ever found out about the fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia, groups (a few units, actually) have been added from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colour flags where the cities of origin of militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by English typhostery.
In Bulgaria they found a typhoseria of true Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all names, therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had previously seen stadium crimes, had been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then will take action: in this case, you can give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in disorders.
An international Daspo that prevents us from attending not only the Italian stages but throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Good luck with that.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is to say, to those little more than one hundred and fifty, they add others to it.
"We must immediately turn this fire off and not legitimize those who behave this way," they say.
So, "good eyes open especially in view of the National game of Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is in fact a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is the secret services, which takes care of the stadium problems.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not wrong...".
This is the thought (expressed in a truly unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzelli, for a few weeks as director of the Viminale Observatory (has taken the place that first was by Francesco Tagiente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been Quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli says, that it is not wrong in Bulgaria to launch the Duke, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - it adds the N.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact happens.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate it for the future.
But let's also talk about the fisques in the flame of Mameli: even those who are not guilty, but if you allow me, they are not education...".
