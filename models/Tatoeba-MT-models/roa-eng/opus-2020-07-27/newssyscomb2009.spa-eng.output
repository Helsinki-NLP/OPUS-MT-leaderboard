The triumph of the right populist in Austria, together make up 29 %
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought about the first approximate results, a considerable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and a significant strengthening of the populist right party.
Strong and special losses have suffered from the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the current president Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the Alliance leader for the future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of votes, so it loses 5.5 per cent of vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Still early in July, when the OVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, Vice Chancellor, Wilhelm Moltererer.
Observers believe that this Monday could be achieved at the exceptional meeting of the party ' s presidency.
Such developments would obviously facilitate the path of the ever-closer point of departure of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPOs) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, 11 percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction on the part of the European Union.
This evolution clearly calls Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he has already assumed his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and has fallen from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore it is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India Can Be Cooled · Global Voices
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles could not be resolved, the Czech-India relations could be cooled, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
So said the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not solved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get in.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Then you can ask for the release of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises to appeal to the High Court and then it would be possible to pardon," said the Chief of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter the matter is by getting the convicted person a "legal competent support", the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic consider the problem of the Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister chose the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received many promises," he only noted.
A Czech Arbitrator a Fight in the Marine Background
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed around it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of 30 members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
His head, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
He governs this job excitement and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far hidden a world little known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials may be found, but also unknown organisms so far that they themselves bear the key to the development of cancer medicines.
The fund is greater than the firm land
Coastal countries have today begun to argue vehemently the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially the continental border, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Border.
"Simply, the continental edge means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches to the coast of the sea, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, i.e., pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request by the country given to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of work.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal aid commission.
The commission so far has processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone ahead," says Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first that essentially extended its marine domain.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seabed area that gave it the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pain for their study.
The profit to be released from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly presenting their requests.
They can do so up to 10 years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the oceanbed declared by the Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity".
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," said the director Mikulka, adding "that his separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and his regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as the few states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to investigate for the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is damaged, it's something like a sea replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, gives us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of hostages the command of special German forces was in the place of action
In order to solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More and more details are being learned about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the Action of Salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Thus at the place of release were the German army specialists as well as GSG 9 officers, the federal police aircraft squad, from the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, also experts in the field of logistics of the technical beneficial institution.
As the spokesmen of the ministries reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support in the place.
"Unfortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the attackers had kidnapped a group of travellers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian and 8 Egyptian companions.
After kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown to the end as well as details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile the saved healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the custody of the German embassy.
He said no words about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, 5 tourists and the special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first U.S. Congress chamber failed with little to save 700 billion dollars for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the Government's package to save financial markets by 227 votes against 206.
Despite all calls by President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, it did not reach a majority for the programme with which disorder should be limited in the financial markets.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture the desire to travel from the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday the travel association of Germany (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a volume of sales that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute's investigation, reserves for the fall months had already risen in number.
So the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on reservations at 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened dollar course above all travel to the United States are of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased by almost one third.
The Germans' favourite destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year went up again - although according to another study the number of the Germans who made a trip, compared to last year, went down.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneary, the beer in jugs of a liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A start at a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional Bavarian suit to suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that binds us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very lisonical above all because I'm first in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist in the Oktoberfest from the north of Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Prado de Teresa everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be casual or unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron receives rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A muniquesa calls my attention to my apron that she had dressed in the wrong way: "The left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind is widow."
O God, now I'm closing behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care about many subtle methods of flirting and wear hats where it's written "You drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous," which he pronounces with a very long "or".
It tells me after I put his glass of a liter of beer next to me that he just drank.
He put it right next to the mouth of fire, most of them think that's a garbage cube.
So Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock at night, health groups run around the party scene and have to worry about poor drunks.
Healthcares appear in groups - all of a sudden there are four people who bring the covered floors from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they return drunk.
You don't see who suffers from alcoholemia and is on the way.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore," gave me the answer a health care man answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Victim of accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred in Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey attempted to become a member of the European Union, the European powers encouraged the desire to enter this country's interior.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacentist style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is placed on schedule at the end of the platforms and takes two towers, one for each corner, all looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the vaulted locker was over, there is no doubt about what was the greatness of the company that this was the westernest door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that cured up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and stayed away from history.
But today, this railroad, the gateway to Anatolia and all the Eastern centres, serves - at least symbolicly - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both Palestinian factions in Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinikilioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shocks, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium malls built and "power pastries" where middle class managers in business suits - men and women - meet at the first hour of the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kinikilioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the Party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey in its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," she tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look both east and west at the same time.
This is not one case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask you, "Turkey could be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answered, "you don't want to face that choice."
Then he highlights a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had recited to me almost of memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would it have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would today be in the hands of Turkey?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there are not many doubts in which continent it will be to which it must claim this fascinating country.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (skele, September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chorus.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It is supposed to be for children under 21, but at the time the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were ending 20 years - we just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changing form) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless if not accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod frequently told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's the only way to sing!"
His rod was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too flowery.
Anyone was the musical skirmish, always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he directed Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any means, been disappointed – on the contrary, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses all over the world."
We'll miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you state that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master degree and a doctorate degree."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham definitely for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his pictures in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They called to my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resin can capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda’s Supervents
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolumen has an even wider interior space.
All of this is combined with refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz has a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolumen are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation is introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow increased sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would increase by 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch officials expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly pale down sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, representing 4,000 less than in 2007, a drop of 16 per cent.
Despite this increase in Honda sales it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent of last year.
The Japanese firm also hopes to achieve 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda share trust the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is made in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between the axles up to 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase of dimensions, also increases interior livability.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - is up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are from the version with engine 1.4, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - are an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 liter petrol propellers.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 liter mechanics achieves 90 horsepower to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This propeller - which previously had reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, he now has 100.
This jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car that Avoids Collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of Nissan accidents, this time, in nature, in particular, bees has been inspired.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and Trade Management Development, BR23C is presented as an expansion of the Security Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During your flight, each bee creates its own personal space in oval shape that is very similar to the Nissan Security Shield.
But most important are the compound eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly continuously within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius in front of BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
"At the moment you detect an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or higher angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent collisions by the small robot.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step in the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan vaticin will introduce into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tiemble before mortgaged
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenious.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages on questionable solvency banks, they have created a friendly and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the bad credit hotel... or shit.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to apply for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
True, you have useful, but little detailed information.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is complete?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because if we buy a better house, we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, to disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock price.
One week after finding an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 % of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at the price per unit of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall operation would be based on a price per unit of $29, or 28 % above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action lost however 6.79 % to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, the director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he is passing under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest Wall Street names to adopt a much more prudent behaviour than before.
The modalities presented last Monday further show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's executive director, " we thought the participation would have been composed of only ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover us. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will translate into a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares if they are sold more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. to about 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A group spokesperson, however, refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solver ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed a lot of relief from the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, who saw their stock exchange quote drop to half while the cost of security against a risk of debt defects took off.
This cost dropped back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of the major Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To re-found the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example from his colleagues and friends, is the third that put a draft for a new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished as 64% of the voters voted "yes" on the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80% of the suffrage.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, 7% of the suffrage were zero votes and 0,7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the suffrage plus one had to be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls were conducted at the exit of the electoral centres and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for the "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly, " he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians headed by the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
So, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, to be conducted in a calm manner, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points consolidating the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, with the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially by the extraction of oil from foreign companies and by foreign currency sending its emigrants.
Taken by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who can make up to two consecutive mandates of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa had already announced that it would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the freedom of health and education services which the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives under the poverty line.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after having been released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 15H30 on board a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they could not talk to the press.
"They are healthy" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoeir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all-terrestrials in one desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they moved from zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the organization of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the Special Forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and they killed half the kidnappers, the others fled," said this manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent from the "relampago" unit to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the Sudanese army he claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a camp on board which the kidnappers were found, of which he killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement that was immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture takes place on the headlines and takes place in the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the wretched sums that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or the starving national historical sites?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have true laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restore it only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 Benevolent persons regrouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy worry about searching in history, preserving with little money lots of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when is a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis which is in trouble because of the impact of the US market mortgage crisis: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has businesses in Hungary, in total with 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held the highest level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission responsible for economic competition.
The Fortis Bank was the first to face the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank can, in a sense, be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including most of the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year of the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of Fortis began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company's shares only decreased by 12 percent on Friday, the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around €14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the sudden fall of Fortis' actions to the insecurity of the US market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the actions have already shown a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far, there was no panic, they didn't invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see the data on the purchase of medication, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which combine the use of prescription data in all cases with the approval of the data subject.
The same must be in the independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox cockroach" - cites the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription monitoring program.
Insurance companies rely on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation for the customer's health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They first sent the customer to medical control and signed with him the contract knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number he easily gets the list of medicines purchased in the last year and half and the program itself draws the conclusion on the client's disease and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of tablets to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is almost incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the programme, some even set a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has only something to do, although there are small difficulties there.
Among the disadvantages of the program are, for example, that some medicines are multi-use, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, require the patient's approval.
The authorities have already forced them to do so, although they have not received a fine for neglect so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory examinations and combined them with drug consumption data obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The draft law that provides the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the supply of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny its approval, because otherwise insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, though everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseilles
The European Union duplicates its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most global areas, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
Today there will also be a Franco-Indian summit to focus on cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Senior Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to increase to more than one billion euros, their trade.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
This legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also stressed, although both sides bear great responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will hold on to its energy and climate programme, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as in next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and a 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas production by 2050.
They also wished to impede the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris hopes that the French companies will be charged EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmese, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow a meeting with the stamp at the Room Struktur in the Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospectives on the state of the editorials in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books of foreign authors progressively decreases over the total Italian production, particularly for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the missing millionaire on September 3, 2007, were found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the Nevada range of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it's the one about which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
The 63-year-old millionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after sighting of the remains, a team of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is the property of Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, the sixth attempt had become the first man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had been flying around the world without scales.
Among his memories, he also had to fly to 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and specific angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-round" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Owned by content out of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the release of the Glk suv, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project with maxi-possters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How will it be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? see.
is clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Trivenet, the ban on access to sports events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Other Italy" group that has been following the Italian National for years and so far, to this day, the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fanatics either.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have been added to a small group (times units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so they are not identified.
They inspire English fanatics.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to the Italian fanatics for the party: all already with the names, so easily controlled.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior now hopes to read the events that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo (prohibited access to sporting events) which prevents the attendance not only of Italian stadiums but also of those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand in a stadium anymore.
I'm so lucky.
But now is the fear of imitation: let those few fifty add others.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why, "well open eyes" mostly in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, which takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"Douce-Duce choirs and arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzelli, for a few weeks now the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that it was formerly of Francesco Tagiente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzelli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not make the sociologist – adds the N.1 of the Observatory – the reactions are attributed in the countries in which the fact occurs.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the silidos in the anthem of Mameli: these too are not a crime, but if they allow they are not educational...".
