I read several books last week.
I noticed she sat in the front row.
I opened the box, it was empty.
I thought she was angry and she'd leave.
I called the door.
I called first.
I saw the man hit by a car.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We went without him, because he wasn't ready.
He left for a trip to the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called the door for five minutes, but it was in vain.
They had to amputate Tom's arm.
They're on the subject right now.
He walked by my side, pretending he didn't know me.
He lost all the money he had.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to run the orange.
It was great, I went to Kyoto.
He was negligent on his part leaving the door unclosing when she went out.
It was an anonymous complaint that allowed the police to reach the terrorists.
It was a great night.
It was a terrible week.
It was a nightmare.
He sat in front so he could hear.
He returned home three hours later.
He comes here every five days.
I see the moon over the horizon.
You come here every day?
Come as soon as you like.
You come here every day?
We're wearing wool in winter.
Watch your cars across the street.
Come with us.
Come any time.
Come anytime.
Virtue and vice.

He lives near here.
They live across the river.
You live in Tokyo?
I'd like to meet your older sister.
I'd like an aspirin.
I'd like a clearer tone.
We want full prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized it didn't have more than 200 yen.
Do you want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
You want another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than she is.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn Esperanto.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book, where's the bookstore?
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with pure air.
