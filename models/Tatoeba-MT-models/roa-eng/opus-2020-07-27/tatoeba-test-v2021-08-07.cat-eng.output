I called the door.
I called first.
I saw the man hit by a car.

He died three years ago.
We called the door for five minutes, but it was in vain.
They had to amputate Tom's arm.
They're on the subject right now.
He walked by my side, pretending he didn't know me.
He lost all the money he had.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to run the orange.
It was great, I went to Kyoto.
He was negligent on his part leaving the door unclosing when she went out.

He returned home three hours later.
He comes here every five days.

You come here every day?
Come as soon as you like.
You come here every day?

Watch your cars across the street.
Come with us.
Come any time.
Come anytime.
Virtue and vice.

Do you want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
You want another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than she is.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn Esperanto.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book, where's the bookstore?
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with pure air.
