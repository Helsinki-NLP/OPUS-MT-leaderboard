Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, like the fourth U.S. president of history.
Diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will receive them, inter alia, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, a visit from the Nobel Institute, where for the first time it will meet with the five members of the committee who elected it, in October, between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple planned a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president who receives it, even though the third one who receives it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, not forgetting to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is intended to provide them with charitable benchmarks, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and other 250 guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the nature accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochranců přírody Litoměřice (Society of Defenders of Nature Litoměřice).
Last year he repeatedly appealed against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded the investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesman of the Litoměřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Defense Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, people can separate the packaging from beverages and in villages south of Moravia can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate garbage at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough for this problem.
Brno is totally backward in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have they ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the middle to the right container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't get angry with me Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Per vagancy
What happens is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But at Calle Kaunicova I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage already overflowed from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the extraliga of hockey, to shame us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or to offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the whole Jihomoravský kraj region.
The budget of "Poroubek" removed money from the rents and sick subsidies
After the left, in spite of the government's opinion, adds funds to farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness benefits or for building savings.
But neither does the interests of State debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently borrow for sensitive expenses, income or sickness subsidies. "This is supposed to only postpone the problems for the future, it is to place mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interests and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to get money.
If the State does not reduce the social benefits or operating costs of the State, the taxes must be increased.
To all who added the left now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, also to your children.
People don't have to worry about the rents or sick subsidies, they'll get them. Out of these accounts, 1,800 million have disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year they will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer achieve a slight increase in VAT or reduce maternity benefits, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year we will also need five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and neither can their price be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Salomon solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from ČEZ dividends, which is mainly State property, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Every year, dividends settle ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of the money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation costs, including in the construction savings.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, at the worst, take over the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Statní pokladna project (State Box), the price of which is two billion and has already been started. It must allow for online monitoring on which the different authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to operate with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualiser software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was first demonstrated.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new mobile technology is at its height.
The VMware company cooperates with European and U.S. operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only the teleskie maintainers in Krkonoše worry about snow-free tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše free rooms are still available for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will have snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer of the Spindl news portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to go to Špindlerův Mlýn a New Year's Eve according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hotels offer mainly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, thought Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us the most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are sold on a regular basis.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also run out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizon hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free squares.
The interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the Nochevieja stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Janské Lázně's newest hotel in Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we find about 60 percent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as it falls snow, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that Krkonoše hoteliers will be spent wanting snow waiting for them.
Thursday should fall temperatures and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Kralové, of the Hydrometeomorphological Institute of the Czech Republic.
US: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, to which he himself took for the fooliest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, expected with anxiety, it was demonstrated that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the "equal" speech used several times in Iraq, but it did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush statement of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that there is no talk today about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp captains asked him again to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the general Afghan operation Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, submitted to the undecided gunmen in the White House for a harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him a further 5,000, although he himself had at least 10,000 before.
The most problematic thing in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, starting to withdraw Afghanistan's troops in 18 months and finalize this procedure in three years.The whole Obama doctrine generated more questions than the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase bears the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the chief each day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After him will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocking for his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they don't want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America starts the triumphal withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution in this way will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential elections and that is why there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses again
U.S. senior bank executives Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers shall receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they have taken too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs became the leader in the effort to combine the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to go, mentioned the former investor bank of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after nearly $17 billion (almost $300 billion CZK) was cut off for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive topic in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at one time, with a tax of about 50 percent, bank bonuses exceeding £25,000 (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Nobel Prizes in all the least physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden this year's Nobel Prizes, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he also depicted among the award-winning a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as by his fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry received it from Israeli Ada Jonath and the American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize given, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each prized received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
Traditionally the most expected Nobel Peaceman received it today in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy that he had been awarded, as he was at the beginning of his career and was also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited you to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is planning to remain in the government, because he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
It is supposed that the budget, and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the office, will be the themes of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
On the date, President Radim Ochvat's spokesperson was informed.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left-wing proposals for remittances and increased the money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the one hand, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, future activities of the Fischer office began to be controversial, the form of which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, actually liquidates the package of saving measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had been neglecting "the serious problem", that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus between political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
The ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucrat cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is shocking, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
Popular people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play them American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winning an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role will be played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama over the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictitious President of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to put an end to apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and so he decides to join rugby players, who belong worldwide to the outsiders.
The South African team was able to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for Mandela's story to reach the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as similar to reality as it was, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that by holding my hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember calling at the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy magazine summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Splendor’s Secret on Resolute Norway: Russians Tested a Missile · Global Voices
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence ended by acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway was conducting evidence of a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, of the kind "Bullava", formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there were no problems at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
The engine probably crashed in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which floated into the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The same Norwegians from the very beginning did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
This time the generals defend themselves by claiming that one cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the hurdle occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, engines were detected immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the releases went through completely without errors, only six of the thirteen failed according to the Ministry of Defense.
The success of nearly 50 percent full of optimism to the generals, and that is why they continue to state that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA from Moscow at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-present at 51 years of age at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, cited AP agency Sergei Nemchinov, coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to one party.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary frontman Gordie Howe played at NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the whole season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The major of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won in the Cup of Canada and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful at the NHL: playing with Detroit twice won the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Gloria's Hockey Hall.
Hyundai has met union requirements. Will cancel all supplementary work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency on Monday by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, that is, we will work on two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28th, that is to say, prolong the Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, mentioned Vaněk.
Employees at the automobile factory were forced to work two hours more than eight hours in shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař unions said on Wednesday, that if they were committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they were willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against the bad conditions of payment and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
Trade unionists in their statement of the emergency on Monday strike, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions require the company to minimise it.
Moreover, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The Nošovice Hyundai car factory currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacture was started last November.
Until last September it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in the 'Clattered' HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of tempering the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines are already accessible.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarborans are made up of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
The metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteases, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and there will be no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus.
If we stop HIV proteases, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a number of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV proteases was performed in evidence, as well as against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used medicines, however they do not lose its effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metalocarbons are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina , the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "scummy" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, he says, think of his future existence.
The ODS statements were marked by the Prime Minister as strong judgements.
They say we leave time for the analysis.
The vice president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucrat cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however, with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as they partially increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus complied with the government's wish, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disappointment and worthlessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reconsider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign in the event of the approval of the amending proposals, the situation might have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, that he is thinking of remaining in function.
The reason is their disappointment in the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, who imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly, if he will resign, whether the House adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness grants, income subsidies, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not guilty
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant posts there were people who belonged to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to redeploy the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which supports the leftist majority, which is currently in the House of Deputies."
However, they will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about it, when it is time, I will deal with it, told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS gave in to the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, we reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When resigning from the mandate, I knew that in the following months it was mainly about reversing the House of Deputies and destroying all positive things, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule less trains will circulate by almost the same rates
Česke dráhy (Ferrocarriles Czechos) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will, for example, win the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
On the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in traffic planned by drahy is in the Hradec Kralové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor route - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15 line of the Sko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem in Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino again.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive the coming year four billion crowns in total, like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the year next will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy has a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year old.
Drahy is happy with the system, and maybe that's why the prices of a large majority of tickets didn't rise.
The changes will occur only in one-day tickets - ČD Net and in the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Filipino armies continue to hold more than 50 people, children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
AFP said so, which previously reported only 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 armed uses hostages as a living shield on the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed members belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency the police formerly persecuted kidnappers because of violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines, Maguindanao province was caused by the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's elections, there were 30 journalists.
Suspected of the involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential nation of the Amapatans.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title esInvictus: Neporažený) was released in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, to whom he chose years ago for the leading role Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, played it Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the World Football Championship are being completed in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the Hollywood "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared me well to play it.
I often found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as is said - to charge his energy, mentioned in an interview after the premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA then won the world cup.
By entering the grasshopper in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
You will still see, if you improve the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as he said in a recent interview with LN, a rugby lover Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesman for firemen in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
The firefighters had previously wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their mind and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's voice, the gap does not jeopardise the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, ČEZ society's voice for North Czech, electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire of the electric substation did not affect the functioning of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps pęs has been in the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It preserves in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three Hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will present a complaint for slander to three social-democratic hetmans.
This is Michal Hašek from Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the Hetman of Olomucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radiožurnal.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with Česke dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the pasta of the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than Česke drahy, which is not true. Let us know the prices of Česke dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's because of slander towards the Student Agency company, said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence from all regions, and according to him they have not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I appeal to the other Muslims who do so too.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of rail regional transport, and uses lying and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new year.
He said, that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion crowns did not convene a tent.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as ČSSD's deputy, I know, which gentleman he is, I'm not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free anti-neumococcal vaccine are culminating.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born since 2 August last year can receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of child age.
Last year, a fourth of the families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococci.
However, parents paid for a dose of 1600 krona and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand krona annually.
Without clutches they will save in treatment, which is needed for children not vaccinated.
So far the state has spent throughout the vaccination of children approximately 500,000 annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of media otitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
According to research in hospitals, 28 children not older than 10 years of age die from pneumococcal infections in our country each year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the coverage of the neomococcal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example noted Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path that we now have to take, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this point we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lekařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all the children were to receive the vaccine, they could be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have initiated the vaccination as voluntary," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that from the coming year over 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to vaccinate against pneumococci.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid, that insurance companies could "get the money out of health insurance."
That's why doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they're paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 frames in his vehicle and towing.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to plunge into the museum, in the region of Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzán.
The News Agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the pictures to a warehouse."
The agency said that Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
The ministers have defended tax increases and the cut in expenditure in the pre-budget report, in the face of opposition criticism, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "spent" an opportunity to show its seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism of harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of the social security expenditure and a rate of 1% in the public sector salary agreements as of 2011.
Social Security Cholera
Trade unions have regretted that low-paid workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and have warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security spending, which will grow about £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLAIVE POINTS OF THE REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
1 point company tax hike for small firms was discarded
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and who earns £40,000 will lose £90, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will earn £110.
The ministers said their objective of halving the deficit by 2013 was "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall over 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax increases and cost cuts outlined were a "sand sand grain" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC told.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, the predictions of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will affect the amount of borrowing and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance has been forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably be down by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decrease forecasted in April, while the loan application would be £3 billion above the estimated one.
"A waste opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of loan applications for £ 789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, avoiding "cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All the important announcements will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the shorter term.
But democratic liberals claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that the moment chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies for the next April mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that the most people need it and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False assumption."
Although ministers did not publish spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be made in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte's counters.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
The FBI is investigating "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether it's the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A. last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was also seeking information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges they have been arrested for and in what kind of circumstances they are being held in," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported Reuters news agency; but said that the United States had to "work closer both with Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei acknowledged some accusations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released him and abandoned him on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the charges of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the plight of the post-election and the response of the government, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski trail was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn an interest site from Bristol into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the track summit, but it was quite frightening.
You see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city ticking.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers made on the track.
After the afternoon event on Thursday, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked for a ban on the construction of minarets and that there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French don't like veils" ("Why the French Don't Like Headcarves") (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide to the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions that interest you most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a city council (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly worldly issues, it holds, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of the most famous, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that French Muslim values and secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than growing pragmatism, perceives "a adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of worth facing the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a courageous 14-year-old, fighting only with the end of his mosque, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The cubs, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one thousandth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is hardly ever adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore has become green by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its coat.

Ellis resorts to reports from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and skid in snowmobiles use high-power assault rifles to overthrow their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overcrowding look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of change.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the movement of ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the ice cords moving under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant people camping in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the flowing system within the Arctic ice, made up of saltwater jets compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the ice of the summer is removed, what is thought can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that place crowns on Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we are boarding, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns on the graves of the veterans in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year stopping in different cities along the way, to conduct events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of paying back to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they did not receive as many visits as the new graves did, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couples took hold of their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadowy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names in the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who would wipe tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Navy artillery Sgto's grave. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, he said.
"A long time after my death, I want someone to remember."
Cuban officers arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the State Department officials on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers, together with the United States Interest Section in Havana, are seeking access to the detainees, who were arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient community blogger, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested on several occasions permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and codified products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government institution, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are in chains for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly dismissed.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as free mobile distribution, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the leader of the country, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He expressed that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials are plotting to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, expressing their hope that the case might help to untie an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah addressed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of al Qaeda that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke since the anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that the men were not immuted and were even trying to obtain proper approval to access the camps of al Qaeda, when they were arrested by the Pakistani police authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence has given priority to trying to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guardians, not letting go those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said Qaeda is a special analysis of aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, due to their potential to have access to American goals and due to their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model what many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators who work at the Bella Center Convention Center in the city, bolder actions for the climate.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police considered the quantity to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "that's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's home country, Peru, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great manifestation, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he made.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to elude it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or by wearing pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is near several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows public attention in general and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence of a test reveals persistent racial differences
The federal notebook of ratings last week on mathematics performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performance systems, the scoreboard showed that fourth and eighth grade students were fast-paced over the past two years, with respect to cities in Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of the fourth grade white students in the D.C. over the last two years have grown from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American couples have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils in the fourth grade in 2003 when the first ENPE was announced in the District was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by paying attention to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating for educational equity in the District.
I am not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message from the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what worries is that we are not dedicating the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, is being trained some teachers to use a new Reading Curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the higher grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the early reading foundations in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum of mathematics from Kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to whom some of the progress reported by ENPE last week is credited.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here's a kind of squabbling dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now the superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
Almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, who considers it an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong response.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, the facades of brick and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where registration costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than of potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! said Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, he thoughtfully said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion teacher-students of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh one the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to go to college.
The question is which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduated from college, a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, particularly Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without completing high school.
Its success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the path to follow for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour at Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
Iraqi Petroleum Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Petroleum Ministry has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated for decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies have moved up in only two of the 10 sub-assembly deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for substantiated deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military retreats, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the third most important crude reserve in the world, said the analysts.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Petroleum Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be close to its competitors and will meet their commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that later confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who is thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the northern Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, talking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner for Qaeda, who led the terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide from the superior command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had rapidly climbed in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of unmanned aircraft attacks led by the CIA has declined since summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to an account from The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decrease may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, said the site.
The UN's largest envoy in Kabul about to resign
The United Nations chief envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by widespread corruption allegations in the Afghanistan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's exit happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but he is concerned that the US military withdrawal schedule that begins in 18 months encourages other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, working with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that the accusations of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "he certainly harmed the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate the efforts of the United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the harsh UN recruitment regulations undermined its ability to capture talent.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for their failure to engage in talks on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war-zone trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, I said, in answer to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictableness of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the instructions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tempting agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of compromising with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before re-thinking any other options, even continue with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devasive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what Thursday called "unfounded and baseless accusations", by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said that it was willing to continue with talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in US projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "the Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more tomb."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said 31-year-old Wang, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously recluse children, malcrepit unique children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was implemented, according to the Division
UN demographics, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 to 3.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while birth rates were less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai's Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A Progressive Relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-woman ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children, and in 2007 many of their hardline slogans were attenuated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very low.
Disappointing Response
Although rural officials on the outskirts of Shanghai maintain that they observed a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the campaign is launched, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, aged 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, aged 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance that the government provides.
Without a social protection network, they claim, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the policy of a single child as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants a single child because she too was: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more bluntly.
For parents with two middle-class races who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about having enough success to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years of age grew up watching their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child requires a lot of time from the parents, he held.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic has to "have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare facilities when the child is 9 months old."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, attracted renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, which include how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the overall increase in the temperature that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page paper, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN top climate official Yvo de Boer described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.600 million annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week were presented.
The United States special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected the claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not agree without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of China He Yafei said that the U.S. maximum climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not economically help China cope with global warming.
With the future economic path of the major powers of the world at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive trying to contain large issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, supported Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will result in a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, prepared a preliminary treaty proposal of 24 pages early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "made political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most exceptional issues must be resolved before the heads of government come to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed to the Belle Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to be able to delineate claims that will be decided next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (from every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, activists playing the guitar show night shows mocking the countries they believe are selling, and preliminary hand-to-hand proposals are passed instead of by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first 225-km train redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train departure that marks a revolution for trips to Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like a ray from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would shorten and the shift of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as reported in the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line that unites London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would go into Scotland.
"This seems to be the most beneficial option," said a railway member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions on capital space, it is expected that an existing station will be extended to suit the high-speed network.
Train industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but wide public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines for the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Contributors face mortgages for an orange £75,000 from a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the spokesperson of the Conservative Party, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange building in his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "of rations", increased his mortgage by £75.000 to build a oak framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a town in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "anajal".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent inquiry by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £27,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a Member.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of the Mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland of Mr. Duncan did not change at the time, suggesting that the whole increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage type of BRE dropped from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March of this year, the type that is now found.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still requesting £1.250 a month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the House opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive " rations" after the expense scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former occupation as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his spending in May, when he found that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole with the form of the pound sterling symbol in Mr Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when he was asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not about circumventing and delinquenting or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the Brighton Beach Palace Adventure calendar
Brighton's palates have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for each December day, using villainics as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed pastries and served free of charge.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unremunerated clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect people to come to an old foreign building as a Church? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Palace Adventure calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to test and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the entire world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in the demand for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the Danish capital ice in protest of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach no later than Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization worldwide, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the demonstration started in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with docks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to the police, of particular members of the Black Blocks, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The quite peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a vigil with candles.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial plumbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo said.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, watercourses for which you can walk as you had never been able to do before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, has given the initial kick to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people went out to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and polishing handkerchiefs with slogans in favour of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters who claimed to act vigorously against climate change were formed.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia claims "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhasia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, participation was 58% hours before closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five career candidates, including outgoing President Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved the vote poll.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, "I regret that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand people, Abkhaz attempted to demonstrate through this election that he was ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new age as an independent state, declared AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large figures show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the poll.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his vodka glass.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz rails for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
It takes a majority of 50% plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The very peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took over to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without attempting to enter.
A stage was set to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a vigil with candles.
A few moments after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people stating that they were primarily members of the Black Block, ultraviolent groups that had already been active during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a dodgy, and four cars were burned near a occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups did not take their eyes off, prevent the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial plumbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unit climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN Refugee Commissioner, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, has given the initial kick to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and polishing handkerchiefs in favour of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters who claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by secondary education reform, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, even though they were eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students from the first baccalaureate will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "is sufficient for hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally calls on the best students".
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be subjugated from the C, and it goes on to point out: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in second degree of baccalaureate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French ten (69%) disapproved the government project of eliminating compulsory teaching of history-geography in second baccalaureate C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives on the right also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" is meant to eliminate philosophy from the second B.C. program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on a mobilisation day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, they will then be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the pre-competition practice, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, you added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the High School, the experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a convincing way the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that he accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Superior Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the “Ernest” conference round, a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey them a desire to know more, explained at the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," AFP Jean Jouzel said, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a highly serious scientific record."
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgusting among prison guards, action is planned
The prison guard unions called Friday a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd guard union) asked out-of-service personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block" them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "convene in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve mass mobilization", since it calls for "indecent and unacceptable" the non-compliance of the payment in December of "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Union Penitentiary (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization ... in order to increase discontent and anger."
The Department of Correctional Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the security unions ensuring that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
The Department of Penitentiary Administration is requested to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the extra hours does not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements", lamented the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional FO union of Marseilles outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threat FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
When tasks and missions are increasing without taking more action, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack staff salaries, estimates the Burdeos Prison CGT.
According to the trade unions, not in all regions the same happens, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, said the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about the gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end-of-year parties in their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be from the start.
Pa Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the statements of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I made you nice presents," he said provoking the president.
It is true, he was forced to admit it before replying humorously pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who wholeheartedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, said the President.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, but I loved that doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again intervened in Los Angeles due to significant "harms" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his associates, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where some doctors found "injurious injuries from the operation" of discal hernia in Paris on 26 November, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility by claiming that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to a coma induced to avoid "sickness and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about their condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannel would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on information transmitted by RTL.
singer Johnny Hollyday joined the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday because of an infection resulting from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but assured that there was no "no problem" because rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to make twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell declared.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure him by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken with Laetitia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated by a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as was expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, their allies even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet at its favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the Worlds-2009 long swimming pool, won an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, a brand that owns in a long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet moved forward to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world brand (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wear polyurethane bathers from 1 January will be banned.
These bathers, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epopey in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, the world's double champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his brand in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I was able to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, explains Biedermann.
US: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday in $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel of 2 meters long for 63 cm high, date of the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satirists and drunken women, is an unusual piece, as in the world there are only four or five," explained AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions from ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest among buyers, no doubt, pointed to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his Parisian particular mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For some 50 years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola" succession opened in 1903, one year after the author died of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborted Zelaya’s Exit to Mexico · Global Voices
Thursday Mexico considered that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe haven.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa declared.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to grant him a safe haven, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as the head of state in guest exercise.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my position (...), they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya on Thursday to radio Globo, in which he has usually made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, he added to some chords the president deposed, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we were unable to accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, declared on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, responded Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as President of the Honduran people, he underlined.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who met around Brazil's embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Zelaya to power until the end of its term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street up, the U.S. commercial balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We receive good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market concentrated "on the medium full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October in relation to September, at $32,900 million.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, noted Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, the unemployment registers in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "has been the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
Ten-year Treasury bond performance amounted to 3,482 per cent compared to 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond at 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred advocates of power over the "Damas de Blanco" · Global Voices
This Thursday, hundreds of Cuban supporters assaulted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, held a journalist from the AFP.
The Yankees are dying!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Liva Fidel and Raúl!" were fond of the power activists with their fists on high.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect them."
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Damas de Blanco" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also about to protest on Thursday for the international day of human rights, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothing, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents forced the vehicles to dissidents who were bullied by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "call for the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" at the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
In the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration on Thursday of government militants against "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A alienate kills an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Seine) on Thursday at the time of the greatest inflow of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man who was born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, interrupted and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was admitted "in shock," reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty gravely.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had cross his back, explained instead a leader of the Alliance union in the Highs of the Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transgenders, including young people, tried to control the alienate, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw itself on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the time of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were wounded in punches, according to the police's testimony.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man wounded on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. By putting him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person came about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police personnel arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Judicial Police of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his temporary detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of admission to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcited" as "all upset of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
US: Polanski's lawyer once again calls for the case to be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who dismisses the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", complained to three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at the same time, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "resolved chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (failed since then) would have spoken to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the rejection of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, that there could be no serious assessment of any dismissal of the charges as Roman Polanski was not before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled from the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sex relations" with a person under 13.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles District Deputy Fascist Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself at the audience."
With this cause, we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is the possibility of fleeing? asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "calls for a favor to the court, even if he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer supports her harassment every time Polanski solves the case, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September in order to arrest the United States.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to a house arrest in his Gstaad hut, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and stops by the dollar raise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday off, in a market that debates between better indicators than the US and the dollar raise: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the definitive closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points, reaching 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management said.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend remained due to the publication of better economic indicators than those envisaged, which "helped to improve market views in terms of the robustness of economic reactivation", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per second consecutive month and higher than expected in November.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers was recovered visibly in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a further advance of the dollar which reached the highest level in the last two months compared to the euro, which "leads down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
Ten-year Treasury bond performance amounted to 3,540 per cent, compared to 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond at 4,497 per cent on Wednesday.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss Mundo's title candidates are in the final line to fulfill her dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu KaBajoo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sporter or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revolution.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and I lived countless experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone said amazed.
This ninth event in South Africa will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:15 p.m. ( GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have survived twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that remove the breath".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press wheels and safaris, Miss Mundo candidates focus on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with bathrobe.
The Chinese presenter, Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss Mundo event.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who held their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
She probably returns to the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiasmada Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," David said his son on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, said to the press David Hallyday on the way down from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 local hours (21 hours GMT).
The singer's son, distended, assured that he would move "to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday due to an infection derived from the discal hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to manage his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors from the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday by an infection, a sequel to a discal hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday to Thursday night because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic of Parque Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were indignant, Camus declared.
It's about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with permission from the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, because I was operated twice of discal hernia, he added.
A short time earlier at the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently gone "no cannon, nothing," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also intervened to reabsorbed a haematoma formed as a result of cerebral haemorrhage.
He is a ill-reputed doctor, convicted of justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a unscrupulous man" accused of "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "not far from being advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "has been performed without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause haemorrhage and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as expected, seems to me very risky, Camus declared.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Centre on the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by the MoDem (Movimiento Democratico) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from any support, so that he could be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, since he considered that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after holding his hand on the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, the current NC) was assisted by Mr Hervé de Charette, who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy inquiring them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under the penalty of judicial demand.
These last few days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the sign UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'ajourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the page of the presentation of its site, the signatures of the letter support.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which requires that the NC immediately remove "the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (their) Internet site".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) marks to the legitimate tenants."
If not, justice will be appealed to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will be warned.
In the letter, they need that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" went out in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Centre has no right, according to them, to use the UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he registered the brand," he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years," but of the UMP.
It exploits in a scandalous and fraudulent way the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to carry it out on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to try to get out of anonymously taking a name that is not entitled to."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt said, she took advantage of the state of octogenary weakness to expel her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star pictures of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years of imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga over one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Correctional Court no. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, be submitted to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Friday will be required to report before 10 March 2010 on whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from a state of weakness and during which periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, on leaving the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The experience will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the allegations of the lawyers were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, all the more so as a guardian judge, in recent days, refused to make his request to open a judicial custody procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under custody and has no tutor.
No other person may appear instead," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be handed down.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter for employees to adhere to "values" identified from above as previously intended to impose on consumers products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market conquer strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customers' preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilisation of employees can end up in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and prospective vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would be to put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Do internal opinion polls, such as the Orange questionnaire among its employees, encourage management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old conductive theory that the American "neurosciences" have recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media have spread widely behind them.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanical management position, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifuntional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a default dox that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social development" and relocate the management of human resources "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Speech by Oslo: for the "Just War" Obama receives praises from the right
This Friday, the U.S. right, was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidency candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my view, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he noted.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered the president to have done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very well, the former President of the House of Representatives was delighted, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich declared, during an interview with the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider as a potential candidate for republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches by George W. Bush and current chronicler at the Washington Post, Obama pronounced "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting themselves as "the citizen of the world", as "always does," he "speaked as an American president" reminding Europeans "who live in a bubble of security they didn't create and who don't do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right-wing, a falcon of the Bush era, the former Ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "monoton, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-centre press commended the President.
Los Angeles Time, although still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his "superproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented the Californian newspaper enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judging him "at the same time of sombre and edifying."
Road transport: three Marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three Marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text in agreement at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very damaging to companies" and "feared to disturb the end-of-year parties," Bussereau declared.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from €8.72 to 9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there will be no more cuts or locks in the supply centres.
But there can always be some disparaging rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, recognized that this is "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and which respects employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will enable, above all, the issue of extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a downturn of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the Finance Correction Bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will request the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply first to the companies that have joined this organization and secondly to the whole profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the greatest speed," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that this was a "ingenuous trade", as the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Unostra was regretted.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions disagreed with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., because of one train every two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Galleries, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "the RATP strives to provide service to large shops".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian city.
The RATP route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circulated in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF indicated that it had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement forces.
The RER A that operates the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or for its purpose arrived or departed from the station Saint-Lazare to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "not satisfactory" according to the trade unions, of a meeting that was held with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RRs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RRA A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium they owe, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even parentheses its premium proposals, commented indignantly by the CGT, noting that the management "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday to carry out "extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP specified.
What also led the unions to say that the company "does not care about the users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
So the direction, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RRB on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents submitted a notice.
Trade unions require a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procured party, a decision that immediately provoked manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that were detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said the press president of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including his President Ahmet Türk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, are absent from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were MPs with no party label.
The decision stems from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, who accuses DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the PKK rebels' legal political showcase.
However, the party asserts that it does not have "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at a time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds will stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the great South-Easter town mostly inhabited by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used canons of water, while protesters launched Molotov bombs or stone-stones with scissors.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen disappointment."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, declared to the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
At first, we opposed the closure of parties.
Thus nothing is resolved, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz declared.
This decision completely boycotted the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snows can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Braubger wants.
At all, it is something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in the winter of the EDF
But with this, your employees can learn to test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
It may be announced by meteorologists on the weekend for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections come out with large salt vehicles, Braubger explains.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the accesses to the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF service starts around three in the morning
It should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres to better.
That's why the EDF begins about three o'clock in the morning, "with it the roads are free until the traffic starts at the peak hours."
The difficult thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in the winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches on secondary and private roads, to which Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where trouble is generated, Braubger knows well.
Around 5:00 a.m., the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
In general, the EDF could not take over the entire bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braubger.
As these become rumbles quickly, the salt vehicle starts as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police may also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa Hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long and 1.50-meter-high animal that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an enlarged head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with hoop-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Pangea Supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relations, the propagation and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of Utah's Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were gathered in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Many Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Therefore, the experts discuss, for example, when the sauris were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous teropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sarropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Herbivoric Ornithischia (sauriums with oat pelvis), to those belonging, for example, to the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also own the descendants of the teropopods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa foundlae also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the teropod with the oldest and most primitive air bags, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sarropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduced that the sauris arose there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages separated at first and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earthly mass, the Supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found the remains of two other teropods together with Tawa not very closely related.
All three cannot descend from a single parented predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science Study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many fossils of dinosaurs are still being preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and the pterosaurians and with many other savours.
Toward the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded worldwide and many new species developed, while the kinship extinguished at the limit of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Successful Stories Were Not Eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
A massive extinction may have been given to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles may not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halts the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has affected the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are supportive of the students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the Board of Directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building taken away last week by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to "delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to engage in the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial complaint.
The majority of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized Protest
Young people from the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the conduct of the director of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the principal of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented in an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left is different.
The CDU used as a pretext the walls painted to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of studying in depth the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, which requests the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from downtown Moscow, is considered the Russian Silicon Valley.
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and firms at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
Deputy Moscow mayor Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science research centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foothold on the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Political Planning City" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The size of Stuttgart 21 is not set for anything high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply and plainly the "new heart of Europe".
The law alone. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rieles, which end in the middle of the city, were considered in that then 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes on a modern railway traffic, as it was previously necessary a huge amount of time to lure the locomotives back forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but it must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about half the route of the trans-European operation lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "The Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impenetrable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course do not have more inlet and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built ICE towards Ulm will be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have done so.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are carried by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by road trucks.
However, the new sections under construction are good for loading trains because of the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than €6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crosses and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long rieles through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been slowly drawn up.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as it should be.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is still pending in Wiesbaden's autonomous parliament, if it is going to appeal to the decision on the prohibition of night flights from the Hesse Administrative Court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the legal judgement of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had written in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the north-west runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the fed State would have to re-regulate the nocturnal flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as expected by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January if it is going to appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal to the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which had been made before the elections; otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one lets his word come true, said the head of the green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We fulfill our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federative government would be trying through distortions of law and tricks yet to obtain their night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally unbreakable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents it, it would never have been his group's assertions about the ban on night air traffic.
The U.S. banks return aid.
The large American banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned once and for all the aid that the Tarp bank had provided to it from a total of 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a US CNBC report.
In this way, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions they had taken over with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: The financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to obtain money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
The CNBC reported from a well-known source of circles, that the U.S. bank could already announce for this Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF's administrative board (German television channel) pushes the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present to a successor.
Last night the group intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the group.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew the Nikolaus Brender contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition to the editor had been organized by the chairman of the Hesse government, Mr.Roland Koch.
It declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument that under Brender the ZDF information would have lost audience indexes.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which it flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law, who described the Koch course as unconstitutional, had even been involved in the debate.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "high-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; 1998 director and conductor of the morning programme "Morgenmagazines"; 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's removal, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Rhine-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the manager's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of supporters of the ZDF control guilds was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized Brender's removal of the guise.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of head of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without the suspicion of giving him the post to a suitor.
In the calculations of the Frey parties, the Liberals of the Left are awarded in any case.
University careers take off
A partial success for students: after a year of educational strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of undergraduates and masters.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each career module should end with a single examination.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities both inside and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master racing.
Regulations of the states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of universities have been talking continuously about improving the achievement and successful completion of a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, a specific content was mentioned.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", it is said in a 30-page document, which intends to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, so explained the director of the Accreditation Board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future, "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to the unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and foster their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reaccredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take up to the year 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Board, which is installed by the federal states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of material and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now, only Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional means are provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring programs and student counselling, as well as strengthen examination offices and outside.
The federal state and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her it should be sufficient a single examination for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, and it is also intended to ensure the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of the year, it is intended to examine all the races about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
Apart from the compliments, there were also criticisms of decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso (socialist youth) university groups, it was claimed that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students as main participants should be able to share their views as well.
The president of the University Board of Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the students' experience," said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree the possibility of accessing a later Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that, for the current generation of Bachelor's students, in the future, there are sufficient Master's places of study with the best possible conditions of study. As reported by a GEW member, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to find a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled," says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book editorial, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the literature forum in Hesse at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God who speaks quite a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his files of Security"
Clearly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in Romanian Secret Service Security against fellow German-ruman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Fraundorfer.
Together with some of the present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had started slowly in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke fear of the Security," Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abysses and the wickedness of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far known, not only author, but also victim.
In his file at Security IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of IM Walter.
He had apologized or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", after having read her own 914 page file.
Those involved must have speculated and known in some cases, which names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's pseudonyms.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with security control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Security (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority of Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is given rather to stratums.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of Security in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Security of Temesvar spoke despectively of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," they finally only questioned her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turning around in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as often as when there are silent blames.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners in front of Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the longings of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, is more than just a footnote.
The League of Champions as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, approached a class C Mercedes taxi a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a driver because he did not yet know the city.
Besides, he could have also driven the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old man drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow it would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reach the eighth of the finals", namely, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Uniarea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to brutally fight against the descent."
The "greater area" was waiting for them the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Luck
The final eighths of the League of Champions (to be held on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of Babbel's successor was limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired them to the perplexed professions of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willing to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more shot, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things that would not have been believed to be possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had evidently missed when Babbel was.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warns the sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and administrators also refrained from overvaluing the victory against a weakened defense due to the lack of relief and totally overrun of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had the sad awakening, he thought Khedira.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate at his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters since three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which re-updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, have faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
This had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change trainers because of the pressure of the teenage fanatics.
Also that his day had been removed after the games, Lehmann was described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the last.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two four.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the coach's team replaced, it would not have been possible to perform the great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," told Heldt and Lehmann to unison; and also agreed the man of the plastic suitcase.
World heavyweight championship race
Hot duel in Bern: over and over Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve rough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko continues to be a heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the version of the WBC association won on Friday night to Saturday in Bern in American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to make the nocturnal that everyone had expected.
Klitschko increased his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice had to be beaten due to his injuries.
Retractor Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches lower, which before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was sneaking over and over from the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively carry his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a retractor, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was challenging Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retractor had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
As he weighed, the champion was forced on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he won at that time at the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his "his" belt from the WBC, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year later, Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September, Chris Arreola, from the United States, won the title.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, I had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still gathering all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after he detonated Nikolai Valujev in November, a height of 2.13 metres.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defense Minister, Gutenberg, for false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and leftists require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations of Kunduz’s air attack, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of being duly deceived.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the TV channel ARD, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "to the knowledge he had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The killing order would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Tropa for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy was part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellorship, the Army and the Information Service had approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast demanded.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected criticism.
Chancellorship had no influence on specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and fully of the background of the attack on convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a field patrol report.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received any answer, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with respect to the complaints made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during the sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver ourselves unimpeded to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleeplike states during the vigil, or see and hear things others do not see or hear, are most often regarded in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drug addicts.
Guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality dissipate.
Onirically modified alert states may appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of Chamanica possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neural communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed – and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of wake-up dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproposals, formations allocated, and we speculated from it."
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T becomes a comic figure.
Its body is two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red flies like blood, deformed, rechinating the teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over the body.
Restrin and malignant voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. plucks two cords from the stereo, binds them to form a hanger knot, and fastens them on a hook on the roof.
He climbs into a hole and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
What a lesson for you!, they scream at a choir that gives him the stamps, "Go to the clinic and make you feel better!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing voices: voices that give commands, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning to him.
At the same time it comes into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as such."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an incognito why our brain makes goats.
According to Fuchs, exception states can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that there are other determinants in addition to the genes.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a maternal viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an incognit how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is not at all manifest for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the detonators of psychosis when there is already a previous provision.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmission system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor in psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
To perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unrealistice Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms associated with psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic traumas.
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not cohibited; when our brain is warm, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Study gable zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended a secondary school.
A running girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a young torpedo with long, dark hair leads the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl's a little queer, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can feel even your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While he waits in the dark room for the dream, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot tell whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the flies or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Your parents and friends haven't told you anything, they'd think you're crazy.
Fall of 2009. Sarah K. She is today20 years old.
He approved last year selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since you've come into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it takes care of seeking entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13 years of age, he learned that the man who calls Dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noisy impressions, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," Kasten says, "has a place in the brain, reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that her patients appreciate her hallucinations as a special skill.
Limitation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneiirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The dreamy hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneeuropatia, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a real situation that is very dangerous to a world of its own and imaginary that is disapplied with reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unattainable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dreamy experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of saving the soul.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen submerged into a world created by it and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself lying on the bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met with a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Lighter and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the internal reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burd
The children will be in charge of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will be in the hands of the family as well.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs 27 years old and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda confirmed, 69 years old, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers to your children, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from January of the chair of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
He later took over the treasury and thus became responsible for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the cusp of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. Her son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will be in the hands of the family as well.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are not safe from decadence: "This has always affected families who become infected by the pursuit of capital, who have been misjudged and thought that they could get up as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "deliriums of greatness," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" on the world league; those businesses have become too big.
Entire beauty
Everything that - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within your reach.
This is what seems to have been proposed The English Court, which has just inaugurated in the mall of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation-; Spagion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with over 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spazona.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most new facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the customer's steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal key to a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Varied escorts
Christmas is getting closer and it's never going to go over the look of the stars to fit them into our party costume.
The shape of the escort, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The Endesa power company, together with the City Hall of Barcelona, has created the 'Live Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Live Office' will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what the transport of the future will be.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
It is the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT Verde.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has undertaken during the financial year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automation Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Automation Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was both committed to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in line with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan has made it possible to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place during the 5-7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only may you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of items related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic motor that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will meet, among others, Mos and Good Old Times Classics, selling cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche selling and restoring cars; or Classics Cochera, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Skill tests abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a enabled circuit outside the exhibition hall.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sport is not denied with respect to the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start-up system - baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the end of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving post, we find that the front armchairs have excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the instrument frame and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us of, in part, the Honda Civic as well.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the living room, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is combined with a large trunk with regular forms.
The engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter petrol engine and 150 horses and with the manual shift of six gears.
This motor is a real delight. It excels for its fineness, its low noise, the benefits and for achieving content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanding Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high walking comfort, and for its contained consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. it incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
Of the series equipment, especially the rail exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
Moreover, in the absence of its equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: Bison adaptive lights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It especially highlights the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which lies between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version - Sports-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will provide us with large doses of satisfaction each day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars have dazzled more than ever in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek’s Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five-minute fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has taken out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as your U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of a roaming at fixed price is incredibly attractive and it would have been working for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated earrings to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a perceptible effect.
There is fear outside the country of origin to use the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (does not stop being curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of fares means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to write down their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no kittens.
It is a connected device and is paid for by buying it, not monthly.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a life-access buying option like that that Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a more just model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he had already gone to Barack Obama's possession as president of the U.S. with a dress and a coat of this color, he had chosen the same to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: besides being a similar color - greenish yellow with brilliant reflections - the twice the outfit was made up of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat on the same canvas-, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that in a first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of it was to try a fat lace, in Oslo it is a stamped third.
The additions have also varied: medium heel green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, melana looses the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75 per cent of working mothers have experienced limited employment opportunities due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in the start of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, begin to live together as a couple, advance their first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay living and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after initiation of cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first age.
According to the survey, the higher the education level, the older the age at which they marry and the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"An additional division is established among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, coining the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous films of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their prizes, which was held in London, in the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Pocker of Aces' (Alfaguara, Fernando Vicente's illustrations) a dozen X-rays of writers who have been through their literary life (and, in cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearful genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but seek something similar to the core of the creative character's ignition.
The trip has its excitement and Vicent does not save any fears or enlightenments.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and readings.
I'll leave you a few moments here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, pulsation that I felt without name: the pleasure against the acidic destiny, the guiltless morals and innocence without any gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic mood, without sense, like the blade leaf that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was overwhelmed by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must climb through the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are drawn again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
In itself, he sometimes said he was heir to a landlord of the county and others who were the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were grand."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry cast from a bridge by that character of Munich to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he got on his knees and prayed, 'God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spenser were recorded: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the hard life pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband normally agreed that she would tell him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the Azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been such a patient and in love with a neurotic man whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Saints do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but go to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did He do but abdicate that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15-18-year-olds passed by her and our dog, a mestizo-racian specimen, rescued from the bitch and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, offered her two kicks that left the dog hurt.
Our indignation is capital, because we did not find the fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which by the way, was bound.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a woman to walk quietly and who, when in charge of these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, because an energetic attack on an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone weaker than himself.
The event took place at 5:00 p.m. on any Tuesday for a neighborhood traditionally quiet.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt it would be useful for a lot and not to generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal free of charge that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among the younger drivers, reported both entities today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while circulating on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "go beyond designing and manufacturing products that are more and more secure" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as being a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increases the sale of light trade
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles starts to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% from 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures of the owner of the Anfac manufacturers and of the sellers of Ganvam.
The good data, not ossive, should be quarantined as the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease over the previous year.
As a result, despite the date of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold all the vehicles that make up the light commercial tailorboard: tourism derivatives, pick up, vans, light vans and trucks/light chassis.
Also, the nubarrons that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
Thus, the restrictions on bank credit must be added to other factors such as the rise in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
In addition to individuals, they can be accommodated autonomous and SMEs who are going to purchase a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles as well as to industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the anti-lock of ABS brakes and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, this is already the case in all newly registered light commercial cars and tourism, while for the rest a period of shortage is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, in its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant is doing more pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the treadmill that the driver gives.
But it does not always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one out of every four claims would be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device shall exert the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delays the Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th probably - reports Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly wants, the new President of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the party concerned.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but strongly charges the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop his last, and jewel face, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as their base and managed to thinn nothing less than 80 kilos, which left the scale in just 1.275 kilos.
This led them to spare, first, the automatic roof that has been supplied by a hand-operated canvas, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they won 7 more pounds; riding sports baccquets another 12 and with light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door handles by one of fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double clutch PDK change, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with really rotated traces
Your behavior can only be described as unattainable.
The weight reduction does not imply that the car does not weigh the asphalt with aplomo.
Rather, on the contrary: it was time that we did not test a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmitted so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
She is a small athlete, able to heat her muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until we order her to spring, brake, recover and express her engine again...
What we ask you for. Thanks to your address, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's blushing, already premiered earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from stopping or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car did well in the boats.
The electronic aids barely made a presence all the way; and that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the funniest driving that one can on the market and that is more than just a change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of Coco Cocoon line and 'starlet' occasional of the parades of the 'maison', the singer prodiges her face of malata with as much continuance as her Chanel pockets.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia Wins in Israel · Global Voices
The Labor Fund won a brilliant victory for 82-91 in its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and thus sits in the leadership of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 valuation).
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer until the end of the victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples annotated had a lot to see in the final triumph.
The party began face-to-face for the blue-grainers, which were placed from the beginning forward in the marker.
That the first four baskets of the victors were out of the perimeter already presage that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more of the same, but the team chose Barac's inner game and Elijah's work, which was received with pits and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though Splitter's 'less than six' rating already made it appear that this was not the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being incarcerated at rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victors that in their court no one wins, and with 'Elijah'''s hand pressing they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turning of the 'marines' to the luminous (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hijack a couple of hits to catch air, and in these came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alvess went out to leave their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already warned that they would not let anyone take away what was deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not sign up and tried to keep your team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed for misdeeds, Ivanovic's people did not rush, defended well, and even though the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Lesions prevent the battle of the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece before the Olympics and gave him the leadership of group B of the Euroliga, in a game marked by the downs of the cashiers, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malawian team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship and not by the rival entity, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio, disembarked the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis , they turned to Mark 22-20, minute 13, when an action, told of a fight, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority in both areas, where the injury reduction from the English pevot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were dragging the cashiers.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Uplift
The third period was very offensive with the Olympics, which despite the 19 losses, was superior and even equalized the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership tangle.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last down of the Scottish pilot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja by Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pilot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remount the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja turned off, handing over the leadership to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the searcher with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? Calculates the user's salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they should enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application is running, the searcher has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovit from its searchers in the United Kingdom and France, Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and one Frenchman, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 who receives one Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most popular jobs in the network over the last three months are drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil closes the exit of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has terminated Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Chairman shall leave the diplomatic liaison by 27 January 2010 at the latest when he has officially completed his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has remained refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27 at the end of his term of office, he has to search for another destiny."
The station also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said by telephone.
Following the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's status as a political asylum that was intended to impose on him the "de facto" government that chairs Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise the markets was to borrow debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity bar to near-zero types for financial institutions to buy assets for discounting.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they begin to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far away from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again, there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries vis-à-vis Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that it came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review at the lowering of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad to put a stop to moral risk defenders who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
Dubai, however, is a tribal struggle between the emires to recompose power in the Emirates and that of Greece, we have seen it before.
A government that conceals public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out of the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to break its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what is expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials extend just as European corporate bonds do not have to worry about us.
If European differentials decrease and our differentials continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our developed indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review up to date their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not hope for a lot of life hope to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "presidency, driver friend".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is being debated these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, to which he followed the President of Natural Gas-Phenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press brushes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million by 2020 and a further €60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are now in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not amount to 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue has changed and power needs to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that has just been approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to bleed to the royal decree to encourage domestic coal consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is a "clear long-term stake" in this regard, despite the "pointual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galan considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started to take as they are late to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the 'handling' of Aer Lingus in ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport services on land, Swissport Switzerland, will play the preferred partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the activities of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Actia disputes her first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Actia stabbed for its first highway in Australia, where she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1.7 billion in Australian dollars (about €1.047 million).
French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Akiona to settle in the country as a construction and highway dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to move forward the project, in a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion (€1.047 million) and in the final phase three consortia with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Akiona, the only Spanish in liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct Consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French Bouygues Building Group.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is the LBRJV, where capital is shared by Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilbao Berger) and the firm gala specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it has a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a subject pending for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, the owner of the Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed by a geographical area of the utmost importance to the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalation business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide sink, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure operations fields.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north link), is called to join the western highway of Toowong with the circulating road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest performance to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets out the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two rails per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute US$ 500 million ($308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday on the acquisition of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The participation by ACS will enable, through its local Leighton branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide quick internet access to 400,000 people and give work to German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has moved the 27-storey King George Tower construction project to the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will share the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia by 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia of EUR 64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after doing the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Mrs Rushmore for an approximate amount of EUR 3 million annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract shows the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs Rushmore has been elected among the 16 agencies that were submitted to the competition convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A lot of 63 million in France Télécom to slow down competition
The competition regulator in France has fined EUR 63 million in France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of France.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reaccident.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the wake-up of other operators and has opened a web application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that have earned more money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Wining the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main revenue sources of the major clubs.
So much so, that the competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that the more money has been paid for participating, and the only one, next to AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
Catalan, the current champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the rankings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also made more money to participate in the League of Champions past.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
Moreover, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Layout
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the organization that presides over Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only because they were there, plus another 550,000 euros for each party that they argue.
There is also a bonus for winning (80,000 euros) and a tie (4,000 for each team). The eighth-finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be charged 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million in front of the finalist 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is of the main, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion remains 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group showed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares with which it pursues a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and would be paid with an interest in this deferral of the 1% annual
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed to EUR 1.85; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezano group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of the offer, even though the company of Ruiz Matemas claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If achieved, the disbursement would reach $611.7 million when the capitalisation of Sos is $254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to stay away from possible offers of purchase and the judicial vavens of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high office in the food company.
It is a new creation post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
With regard to the Salazar credit, yesterday the former counsellors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared at the National Court that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorises the exclusion of Paternin which Inversora Mer submitted
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised yesterday the exclusion opa submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are in accordance with the current rules and considering the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments made last December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Stock Exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for piercing cars
In these days of time and accidents, they not only win the car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated work.
It calculates the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including man-made parts, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of shorter
That's why almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, and then to develop it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the US group Solara, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxation and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes into the market, these companies start to work.
It is very hard work, because we have to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be caught.
If it is a fan model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information about 99.2% of the cars being marketed in Spain.
The most exclusive models include information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out documentation work and the development of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each one specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the preparation of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinister evaluation solution, intended for experts.
It includes light or heavy industrial cars, motorcycles and vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After each insurance company, which performs thousands of experiments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its base number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSbastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to climb by the vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geodemographic analysis or to know deviations by homodel brands.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have been through the workshop because of damage or how many serious errors have been experienced in a given period.
Gt Reason is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It trades, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solutions to assess damage, damage or maintenance of the automobile
The Gt Taxation Guide is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year their process of internationalization began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion in stock exchange, and now its shares are worth $2.4 billion in total.
Since 2007 it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Substation via the Internet of Accidented Cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or sinister special vehicles.
The operation paid out EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended in the coming year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, slots and professional sellers that must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose base number has been given off cannot be moved back, but can be used as a replacement for parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even though they have been discharged after a hard drive.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search the replacement, create the budget and generate the budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who, to a greater or lesser extent, are usually more responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourism, 109 underground, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with internet connection.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired using its frame number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the labour price, charges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that workshop oriented does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
