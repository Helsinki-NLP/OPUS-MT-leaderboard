Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first turn to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would speak of war in Afghanistan during the award.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is leading a war in two countries at present.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about Euros 1.1 million).
It intends to donate to charitable works, but it has not yet concretely decided which ones.
Its programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
For example, he mentioned having a feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the time of the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of the nature accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Protectors.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction construction procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk for up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting benes are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks, while in the villages of Moravie du Sud you fall on tri bennes at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before finding the right bandages.
I don't mean we wouldn't pick the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that our city's city councillors, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone's age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of benes dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which mainly requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me, but it seems to me to be a lot less.
Not to mention that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a sinicure either.
So to conclude, many of my friends don't pick their waste.
By the way.
It makes them a trot to get to the bandages.
I'm not surprised.
After a party, I proposed to throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any colour baths on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
This said, the waste was overrun.
It is after all the centre of Brno, who is supposed to represent the city best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aestheticism are not too interesting to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy a place in the city in the first league of hockey that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra benes and to offer the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has withdrawn from the pension and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who are going to rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just to bring the problems back later, to mine the land," said Janota.
It should be noted that interest to be paid on borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who are on the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year there will not be a shortage of 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more rapidly and with it, the costs related to interest.
The state will need money to repair it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or decrease maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be worth five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started and which are not possible to change projects to reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the caution of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very appropriately - it will be possible in the ČEZ dividends (Electric Energy Provider and Distributor), which the state has in most of and will feed the transport funds.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and it is not at all a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to provide a reserve for retirement reform that is preparing.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the carnival transfers.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch on the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a lack of 100 million in the draft State Fund worth two billion, which has to allow us to monitor on-line the costs of each administration.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that were revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not a matter of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is expanding.
VMware is currently working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to current 2012 devices.
The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
The desert tracks are of no concern only to the lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski trips in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to decorate free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users travel through offers, ask for prices but do not hesitate to make a commitment to reserve for the time being.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year's dreams at Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not be too hesitant to book.
If you give priority to the savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels currently offer only one week's stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to place them again, but they're going to give up and accept shorter periods too.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," thought Jandura.
The Vrchlabí Intours tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is the most interesting thing for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still a free room, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few less expensive last minute Christmas holidays," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizon Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as well as Christmas.
There is a great interest during the vacation of January of the Polish and February also sells themselves well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of Jánské Lázně is also completed at 90 percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent occupation at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for the stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow still has indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers at the Krkonoše, however, do not have to hope for more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later on, time should warm up, Jiří Jakubský report from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, with which Barack Obama, president of the wise reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered to be simple himself.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so heavily expected, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful to such an extent that the newspapers at present are not talking about Iraq at all.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, which says, objectively speaking, he left his successor a far more favourable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle will reproduce
It was once again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habit of subordination.
He requested 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he cheated at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in extirpating Europe's 5 000 additional promises, even if it had 10,000 originally.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to remove the Afghan armies within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. All Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same fruit as the growth in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be relied on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders to the day according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "ready-to-do" state, which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy is perplexed by its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "soon return to the house" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will view it as an indirect abstention from the US defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is in the negative direction.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions do not have an effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem through the use of military force.
For example, there will be a need to respond when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution of this type will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
Obama's only rustine is the fact that he remains three years until the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time left for him to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
The high-ranking employees of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The society has announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn to the leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus takes the lead in the effort to link wages with long-term performances at Wall Street.
I assume Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after nearly $17 billion was set aside for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of today's announced measure, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to allocate a single tax of fifty percent of bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields beyond physics
There are five women, a record number, who have received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in the technical disciplines and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the Romanian author Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for Research in Chromosoms.
The price of chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom, with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (approximately €1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since he was only at the beginning of his course and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy he added that in certain situations war is essential to achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will reside with the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the coming year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position at the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which further exacerbates the public finances crisis.
It was Presidential spokesperson Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation to be submitted to the signature of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers Wednesday and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government challenged the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left, the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, which called into question the future of Fischer's office that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, suppresses the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer Government and that it must call the State debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but is not obliged to do so, said today during a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unrecognisable deficiency" of public finances.
There is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is overwhelming and that the government should question its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer functioning.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is gross and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has already proved successful in ratifying the State budget for the coming year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will expose the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sport, relationship between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, a awarded American actor at the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, an tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it's a 90-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally."
The seventy-two-year-old actor who has been rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the box has, for example, incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, even God in the movie Evan Almighty but never someone who is still alive and as important for as many people as Mandela is.
The former South African State man was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincuous and it is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela's newly elected country knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in bringing it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I hold your hand, I recover from your energy, it transmits and I felt like knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become someone else.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the hood of the Eastwood director received positive opinions and even talks about ambitions for the Oscars.
The movie critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well accomplished film."
In film evaluations at the site rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of aura in Norway is solved: Russians tested a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bullava"-type missile that was originally to be the pride of the Russian army became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she was damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was performed at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It's clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be properly fired from a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely to have been a defective "Bulava".
Besides, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak of absolute failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the trial launches went unabated, the Ministry of Defence's leadership considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals of optimism and they say that one day "Bulva" will fly without problems and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetissov will again present himself in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend hand-fort to his team of the CSKA Moscow in need and will probably make his way to the game on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is for the time being the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assistances.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetisov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he has twice gained gold at the World Olympics, seven world champion titles, he has triumphed at Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Temple of the fame of hockey.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that trade unions declared an emergency strike Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
Management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded later for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, has decided to change the way its employees are motivated in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their end-of-year holidays named Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees in the car factory were forced to work almost daily for two additional hours in more than eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case of agreement on their claims and signing a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously crashed due to unintended overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wages and alleged gossip.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for car production.
On Monday's announcement of the strike, trade unions also requested that employees who have ceased production be subject to no penalty.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of about 5,000 crowns (about €209) for these.
Nošovice Hyundai car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed a drug immunity.
This reality, in some cases, takes over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the current variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the life of the sick can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have any effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are a combination of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all medicines used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protein is a protein of the HIV virus that is indispensable to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protection is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of HIV-protease substances has been tested in evidence as well as in its resistant variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
In the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current medicines are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to further examine to develop effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína , director of the structural biology laboratory of the organic chemistry and biochemistry institute and the institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
It's all about the budget. The ODS is taking it to Fischer, who defends himself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the ratified budget "discharge" for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge his existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDO as a drastic verdict.
He said to take some time to analyze.
The spokesperson for the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer functioned.
According to Nečas, the Chief of Government should decide whether the House of Deputies would support the minority concerned with the fight against the growing deficit, or whether it would be concerned to remain in office with the support of the Parliamentary Left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget Wednesday, with, however, proposals for amendments to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber increased money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance to the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion krona.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the wishes of the government as a modified budget is a less evil variant than an acting budget.
Disappointment and futility
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made Monday appointments with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment about the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did not do anything harmful, Topolánek pointed out in a textual communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the Vice-Ministers of certain ministries are calling for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in response to the fact that he is fighting the amount of the public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber."
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it's on the agenda, so I'm going to dedicate myself to it, told the journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went back to the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably have voted on Wednesday against the modified budget if it had not specifically asked Democratic Members to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticized by the President of the Party in the Chamber or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a overthrow of the Chamber and a destruction of all that was positive, responding to Topolánek in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit certain less-loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will strengthen some less-loaded trains.
The total coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new two-percent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Iron Roads will add a pendolino copper.
On the contrary, an expression will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague - Písek - Českeé Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest drop in transport relates to the Hradec Kralové region of eight percent in total, but Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague line - Tábor - Českeé Budějovice are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague line - Písek - Českeé Budějovice will reduce to just a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, Milovice residents must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, which is possible through the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will be paid to the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate at almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration has been one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase of the vast majority of transport licences.
The changes will affect only one-day tickets ČD Net and eLiška reduced-price Internet tickets.
For travellers without discount cards, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the route travelled, while up to that time it was valid between cities of a region to the choice and was at a single rate of 160 krona.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed him of this, but that he spoke only of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
Hostage was taken in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels used hostages as human shields when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police initially pursued the raptors as a result of the violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Mayindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre linked to the governor's government elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father, Andal Ampatiuan, patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatiuan.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American halls in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the global apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the returns of critics and the public were heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name was Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.He was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes, as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on the one hand preparing for the World Cup of Football, and on the other because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the rise of racial conflicts and discrimination among the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations issued to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavannate".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking his own terms.
I've dreamed of this long-term role and I've been well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met personally Nelson Mandela to be able - as we say - to recover from his energy, did he indicate during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but this is about every individual he added.
Bring the jersey from the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people paints the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he was wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the world cup, which South Africa had then won.
To show itself on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been extensively ovationed fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Hopefully, the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are sceptical as they recently entrusted it in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of flame crowns in the Louny region
A fire broke out in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company of the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov in Lounsku.
According to Lukaš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí firefighters, there are six units that operate on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinions and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesperson, the incident does not endanger the secure operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is gone.
According to Mandátova, the destroyer will have to be replaced by a nine.
She added that in ten years of activity, Čeps did not know anything similar and that such incidents were isolated.
Power supplies were not interrupted, ČEZ's spokesperson for the Northern Bohema Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova stated that the operation of households, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire in the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 electric power transformers from transport sets to distribution sets and line traces of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančura will bring defamation complaints against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is now filing a complaint for defamation against three Social Democrats Prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the mayor of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three of us were attacked and said that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are cheaper than Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the Czech Railway prices that were signed last week.
So we only have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for the slanders on the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that there was evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is a follow-up to his media show, which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I assume this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and lying arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek says
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he would like to resume after New Year's.
He stated that the campaign will focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without calling for tenders.
According to Jančura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats from a Member of the ČSSD to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I don't know who this is, but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free and optional at the same time for families.
There are already votes, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children from August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid by themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for one dose.
Vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year, health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses.
They, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
To date, the State had spent approximately 500,000 crowns per year on all vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococces are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of severe infections including inflammation of meninges and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 children under 10 years of age have died from pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible requirement for vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococci.
At an international conference at which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction to follow now said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not want to change the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We do not consider it absolutely for the time being, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society for Paediatrics, recognizes that vaccination based on voluntaryity her shortcomings.
If all the children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," said Cabrnochová.
The specialists plan that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Immunization against pneumococcals is also a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should set aside funds for prevention, thereby saving potential medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This, however, is linked to the concerns of practitioners, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "decrease the amounts of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 krona per month in vaccines individually, which is a significant amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while loading 90 boards in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the entrance of the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the press agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Mr. Frazetta Jr claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Senior refused to grant such permission, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budgetary tax.
The Ministers defended the increase in tax and reductions in expenditure announced in the Pre-Budget report, despite criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "failed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the decline of the deficit by reporting its decisions until the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession they were not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The decline in Social Insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion a year - has angered the world of businesses, because he believes it is a job tax while the goal should be a boost to the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will reach about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% banker bonus tax
The increase in the corporation's profits tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Tax rebates on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person who wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person who wins 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person who wins 10,000 GBP per year will win 110 GBP more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh the first 5 percent of the employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be met - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the pre-estimation.
"Unopportunity missing"'
The Conservatives who launched a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "debt crisis", stated that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, did they add, elucidate "cynically" difficult choices until the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Treasury of the Cabinet Ghost. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, in contrast to the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, political editor of the BBC, stated that the timing of the announcements - such as the increase of inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of accusations of propaganda, being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the details of expenditures beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public expenditure would only start to feel that in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Etudes Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. The markets realize it."
The FBI is investigating the arrests of Americans in Pakistan.
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern Punjab province, announced the US Embassy in Pakistan, to the BBC.
The FBI said that he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he was also seeking information about these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and what conditions they are in," said the spokesperson, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, spokesperson for the FBI said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it really is the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington stated that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, refused any comment on the arrests, reported to the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States should "more work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from home by their families in Northern Virginia, late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian abuse
Over the past twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the presidential elections of June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its non-respect of human rights.
The authorities stated that such criticisms were politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have tolerated no criticism, says our correspondent.
"Further confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of 'Working with Facebook Networks' and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half consciousness, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
While the Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, they admitted that they had been abused.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A runway in the park) attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders in competition for prices in species.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view on the top of the runway was beautiful but that one was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city sparkling in contrabas.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowmen in the country - of real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's feast, the snow will be abandoned to the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for over fifteen years and its effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country today.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
They are these practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the very end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their lawyers' counterparts from a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believed that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the conservative intellectual elite so virulent of secularity) were really engaged in pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects "a narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their seats.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by hunting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then brave looking for 14 years to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming beside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the area necessary for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often refers to the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Motoski Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it's in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will stay the longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse of what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not a mistake to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, the pioneer trips to Fridtjof Nansen provided the first information on the source of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the changes in relief below it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hard men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, made up of saltwater nets pressed in ice cream.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it might be our turn"
Marines, of the 6,000 people who filed crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of Angello Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery, this day was devoted to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
Within a few months, where we will be sent, we may be in their place, Robinson said about the soldiers who have fallen.
If that happens to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to place crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for victims of United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a senior member.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmytoufled in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between lawns and large hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, as they were not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held by hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhuman.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others looked to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the wet soil for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had taken eight hours to gather on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free for... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, claiming the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase the tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare American prisoners in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press associate with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- distributing mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, when both countries began to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities found an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this would lead to the dismantling of a large network of terrorist recruiters who listen to the Internet for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
Upon arrival in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida's home and terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani Secret Service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east as a haven of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
For this reason they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations for entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining the people in whom to give their confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US secret services have focused on infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove themselves spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention, in recent years in the choice of people they accept because American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have walked on the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center congresses of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000 but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day that few things took place during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked out of the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined in protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to Peru's mother's home country has opened his eyes to the heart of the country's burning problems due to the impact of climate change that has already taken place."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to put the word through and call on the leaders of the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing have lit up several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what is happening outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors in climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or hinder the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news to public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District remains still far behind the institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is apparent from the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of Afro-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the success gap increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of the whites was not included in the test results as the sample was not significant enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased over this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise of the teaching group director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (democrat apparent), D.C. Council Member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the test results message is that middle schools in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the end classes of the elementary and early college course who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier into their school journeys and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program for Kindergarten (material) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were put in place in the District by former Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue to work to provide better interventions to these lower- than-class students, Rhee said.
Others believe that NAEP's results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest parts of Washington.
As a result, targeting may have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she is trying to serve the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, no matter where they are from, can ensure that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "start point" to get an additional increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, goes down and blinks a moment of eyes in the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students from Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than an enthusiastic student.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela cried out that he would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says dreamy, when he was told the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left the high school where they became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a second generation Hispanic on five-year high school studies" -- a remarkable success if we consider that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico and Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the bats claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high targets for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentorate programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to consider providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which is disabled by tens of years of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with a participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for field auctions in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and European companies that open the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a web site.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, supported by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated have slowed down US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with greater force that owns the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided their technical advice, have returned empty hands.
The Russian companies Lucoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has more ink on contracts than other companies and has left with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies for auctions made offers that were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida's operations this week, said Friday from the U.S. counter-spyping authorities.
If the information was confirmed, it would be the second murder attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that missiles had been fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan's anarchist tribal border.
They drove a white car, headed towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret service member, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority stated that the suspected local activists precipitated on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally torn bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military organizers of al-Qaida who led the terrorist operations of the group outside Afghanistan-Pakistan.
His role was to organize plots around the world, he affirmed one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalov, leader of a tribal belt militant faction, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while killing the suspected informants, the site states.
UN Special Envoy in Kabul retires
UN Special Envoy Kai Eide in Afghanistan said on Friday that he would resign from his position in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of widespread allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States calendar for the withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and require other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
Representatives say that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italo-Suisse citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's charges -- which were thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to the international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations Officers to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy employment regulations of the United Nations hindered its ability to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the major world powers were soon to impose "great additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwife of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the eventuality of such a complaint.
One of the things that weighs me the most, is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranian streetmen.
He stated that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back to full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks, on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a large part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has strengthened such an agreement, a way of developing trust on both sides and making time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have drifted away from attempts of agreement - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I believe Iran's raid on some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact agreed at the beginning of October, has moved the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement to New York Thursday, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he took the plane to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with the Team Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in the US plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up with propaganda posters preaching them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby, it's an extra grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left, said Wang, 31-year-old Human Resources Director, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older persons accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while birth rates were less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Established in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and be discriminated against at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have entrusted the police with the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous tendency for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encourage families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has deployed family and volunteer planning officials to meet couples at home, and to drag prospectuses under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wished to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointment Response
Although officials in a rural town in the Shanghai suburbs say that they have seen an increase in requests for a second-child couple file after the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, always receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly greater than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caulu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider that the single child's policy is a problem of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
True, we steal the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was a single child herself. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it is more crude.
For couples working at two, middle-class, which lowers the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish and succeed.
20-30-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting in the early days of capitalist China and they don't want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write his or her CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual crimes -- has returned under the light of the ramp on Friday, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it has clarified the path to be taken.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not state how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming in the long run and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a great deal of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal changes have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration became tougher to China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the US principal negotiator, either lacked "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to fight climate warming.
With the future economic paths of the major world powers at stake, defects have occurred both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle involves more saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make large issuers responsible for their actions.
It's really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, which is also a climate advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries, more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants said that negotiations would lead to a minimum, to political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the complete political process", partly by what they are now unified and asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the problems in progress before the Heads of Government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Deputy Minister of China have descended from their aircraft and precipitated themselves in the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in cloze and briefings, in order to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congresses every day -- guitar-player activists show night shows mocking countries, betraying themselves, and proposals being written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
Intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Great Court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km/h train will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 p.m., on Monday morning, a whistling will blow the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will sail from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first suburban train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Great Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
Small holes will become flourishing suburban cities, business travel will be much shorter and the passing of the plane and the car on the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and the fears of danger to the environment might slow down British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will make its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next high-speed network phase.
The new London line to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Peninsulas in Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option' said a rail professional.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's trip now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow trains of 400m length and capable of transporting 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the network at high speed.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers reimburse the loan of GBP 75,000 for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of books a year to reimburse the cost of an orange shop he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demolished by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintenous" increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commonwealth authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village of his constituency in Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons concerning its prior borrowing arrangements.
The Committee has innoculated it in the last month of any charge of non-compliance with the rules, after an inquiry into its expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the GBP 271.406 loan of his London property to his constituency he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest up to March last year.
In April, its applications increased by over GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RIB loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were aimed at financing the GBP 75,000 loan.
The variable standard RBS interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Common Authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Chief Ghost Firm in September, after a cover-up journalist allegedly filmed him declaring that the members of the parliament should survive "on-budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil negotiator, began to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the fee office that it "could be considered excessive".
One activist dug a £ hole in the M Duncan lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had requested GBP 4,000 for three years.
Questioned about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of theft or development or use of the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be cleaner or simpler."
Trust me, all of you come and see the Brighton Advent calendar.
Brighton Beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their booths for every December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 to 6:30 every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The songs of Noel selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and director of Beyond.
He said: "We wish religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have conducted several hundred inquiries.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, have paraded in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is responsible for reaching an agreement on 1 January 2013 by Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has contributed to making the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the court broke out, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, observed an AFP journalist.
Anti- riot police were immediately involved without planning.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, essentially according to them members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultraviolent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were questioned "without distinction", stressing that some hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday night "mooted and held in position despite extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the court, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, a website of negotiations.
The protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set up to host the planned speakers, before a candlelight watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrators had come from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélica Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, watercourses where we can walk as we've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the Altermondialist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French Euro-Deputy José Bové, a figure of althermondialism, explained to have come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cutoff between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, with bandanas enjoying solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, meetings of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its president, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first interim results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates, among whom the outgoing president, Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regregates Abkhazia to have fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the poll office at a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the Presidential in this region to the sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are located a little everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the District Chief, Beslan Archba, has provided a warm welcome to Russian officials who have come to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as that which gave Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have walked around the world on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on whom they live, have interviewed almost 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of Parliament, the overall good child court took the lead in the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the centre, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set up to host the planned speakers, before a candlelight watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the court began, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti- riot police quickly circled them and intervened without planning, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mostly members of "the Blacks Blocks", these ultraviolent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a shark during incidents that led to the interrogation of about twenty people, according to the police.
We have at sight the extremist groups, had warned the spokesperson of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order were turning to the sky.
The majority of demonstrators, who came by car and by train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French Euro-Deputy José Bové, a figure of althermondialism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cutoff between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, showed red clothes and bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, meetings of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Geo history is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in the scientific terminal.
Now, the first students will all have four weekly hours and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S line is no longer a scientific line" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L lines cannot remain sub-files of the S, he continues, highlighting further: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals become aware of the absence of the history-geography in terminal in technological lycées."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disagreed with the government's project to suppress the mandatory teaching of geography history in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some elected on the right.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they felt sacrificed the teaching training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will lead to their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow in-service courses during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the proposed internships before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, has continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Supreme Normal School of Ulm Street, Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, observed a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and they wanted to know more, explained on the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of that day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some twenty speakers were selected from among the experts in their discipline, and they were selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will retain that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be posted online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison supervisors' unions called on Friday to "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end-of-year festivals of additional premiums and hours for which payment was refused in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be in service to manifest on Tuesday morning before prisons and "block them" to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization", finding "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the autonomous federal penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization ... to bring up discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that regals will be paid in January.
The Chancellery specified at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors ensuring that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts of staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the additional hours is not repeated in the future, says Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for management staff with the famous functions and objectives premiums, the Ufap/Unsa deplored, for which "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a scandal, the interregional union FO de Marseille was outraged, by announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, i.e. for overtime, also threats to FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take on the money of the staff, according to Bordeaux's CGT-penitentiary.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less bad than others.
But in any case the account is not there, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "more hot ends" than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, entrusted to the "papese" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give more sweeter things than I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year festivals in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family will be part of it.
Father Noël also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "certainly" a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama took a false stand against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "I certainly didn't offer you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to grant before replying with humour by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace from his finger: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show at the casual atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a strong support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his Kenyan father rarely saw him offer at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, said the president.
It's only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than fixing it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday's recaptured, RTL claims he's in an artificial coma.
Johnny Hallyday was revisited in Los Angeles due to significant "kids" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was rebuilt on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "loans resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia that was suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "necessary repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to assure itself that the situation was "under control", while a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday, however, would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "wrinkles and complications".
Only in 48 hours will there be a little more certainty about the patient's condition when it opens an eye, add RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service has neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also states that "under certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days had been practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the arts community.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on the information of RTL.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but made sure he didn't get "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a mess because 12 hours after that operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to reassure himself, asserting that Johnny Hallyday "was responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "individual".
Mr. Camus had also said he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated by a "small colon cancer", then by a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage had even denied a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple World medalist in the 2009 Grand Basin, won an international title on Thursday on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m free swimming, at Euro-2009 in a small watershed in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a deferral.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who swung on the world record of 50 m free, whose brand he owns in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two swimming queens, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet led the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had thought it would.
We can always dream better, and in the event, I said that if the world's record was within my reach, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from 1 January.
In February 2008, these combinations were completed in the first season of Istanbul in 1999, during the same competition with 238 world records.
The use of combinations has not been used this time in German Paul Biedermann, the world's double champion in large basin this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the brand he owns over 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless stood by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give a shit about this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: Sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophages belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, well above his estimate, announced the Sotheby's art merchant.
This panel before two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural décor, surrounded by satires and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," explained AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have most dear so far, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous Borghese family collection, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the III Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of the Pétain Marshal.
There remained a shadow zone of about 50 years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola" sequence opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied an exemption from the Putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived on Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its home, according to a source from the Migration Branch.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to resign and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him an exemption.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the guest head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wanting me to give up my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on radio Globo, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted an application for an exemption, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it contains no asylum application, said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, had responded Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to take place as President of the Honduran people, he had stressed.
The starting rumors of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the soldiers had strengthened their seats.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to respond to the offence of "high treason" which accuses him of justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial poll recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures showing the resumption of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was allocated 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
But does this remain anecdotal, has it tempered, believing that the market was focused on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, by Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit declined by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite to a gap in the deficit.
Both imports have increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the Economy.com research firm.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States have increased against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
Ten-year Treasury Bond yield increased to 3.482 per cent compared to 3.423 per cent on Tuesday night and the 30-year bond at 4.492 per cent on the eve.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power-Partys Consists The White Ladies · Global Voices
A few hundred Cuban supporters gathered wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another event for which some ten dissidents were arrested.
Forty women in white, married or close to political prisoners, were taken to the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the capital centre to claim the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaires!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" scandalized, the fist lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came to "ensure their protection".
On the eve, a similar demonstration took place against the "Dames en blanche" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana area of the Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also ready to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were interviewed by police officers in civilians, a journalist from the AFP.
The police have forced the dissidents who have been conquered by government supporters, according to this journalist, into civilian vehicles.
Complaints of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda was serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under locks.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In fact, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "revolutionary opponents".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of undermining rights and freedoms, including expression.
A force killed an octogenary by the knife and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed force of two knives killed an octogeny and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenary, in or in front of a pharmacy of the 85 Jean-Jourès boulevard, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Grievably wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a head of the Alliance police union, died at the hospital following his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took on a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged 30 years, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then run off to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a quadragener, the latter gravibly.
The scene remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in a cross behind his back, explained on the spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to evidence collected by the PSA, tried to master the force.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was tough, said Alberto, server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell upon him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, including their officer, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with punches, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came to tell me there was a person wounded outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put it in a safe position, and I noticed a very important pain in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later came a second person in about thirty years, wounded by knives.
These were the national police personnel who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office seized the investigation of the High-De-Seine Departmental Police Department (SDPJ 92).
The force was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forces of this species whose forces decay under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again calls for the abandonment of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges in the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who had died since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural failure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared that he had "mention" to the documentary author at the end of September.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel demanded that a trial be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a underage 13 years.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to present himself at the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor to the court, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to his chalet in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, stopped by the dollar's rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended off on Friday, in a market lined up between better indicators than in the United States and the dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, technologically dominant, dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management, has been raised.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market views about the solidity of economic recovery", summarized analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second calendar month and much more than expected.
In addition, consumer confidence in the United States increased significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes have been constrained by a further increase in the dollar, at the latest two months in the face of the euro, which "sets down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The Treasury Bond's yield at 10 years of age has increased to 3,540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday night, and the bond at 30 to 4,497% on the eve.
Miss Monde's election once again in South Africa
After a month of adventure across South Africa, the 112 Miss Monde candidates are ready to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket for the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du México, Mariatu Ka rgbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Sports Miss or even Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and experienced so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone exclaims.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 p.m. (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my crown back.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, notes Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and to present this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss Monde Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knew how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates have as last year made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who held their hands.
It's not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the random drawing in Cape Town (south-west) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could approach.
I'm definitely going back to the 2010 World Cup, and Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi, is excited.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles, where he had to go to the bedside of his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday on his way out of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local (21h00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a discal hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photographer of the AFP.
The orthopedic and trauma chief of the Pitié-Salpetrier Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit Los Angeles on Monday with the singer.
The producer violently challenged Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were out, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "walking too fast for Los Angeles, with permission from the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, since I had myself two discal hernias, he added.
Not before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, nothing," after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts community.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to solve a hematoma as a result of cerebral haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with sulfurous reputation, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medically responsible cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the physician's lawyer, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who was "regularly" in front of the Council of Order, and who is "not to be recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well performed" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Clearly, a return to the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as expected, it seems very short," said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association increases the tone and sum of the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem by François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt of OPA by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, by continuing to use it no longer on any media, subject to criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his approach, he was supported by Mr. Hervé de Charette (formerly NC-UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to deposit it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of his silence to launch an appointment to the Minister and to the MP, summizing them not to use the seal and to transmit to them the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to +learn+ the UDF logo, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow up on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, of today's slogan + the UDF+, also see the mail signatures.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this seal, explains the UDF office which still retains the NC to "immediately withdraw the name of the UDF from any media as well as from (his) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) the mark to his legitimate entitled."
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories are prevented.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choiced" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore considers that it has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the trade mark", he was not "more adherent to the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
It exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of deposit of the UDF acronym to do it on its own.
This indelicacy is being turned into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him of having a state of weakness of the octogenary to strip her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years of imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter break apart while holding the realms of the empire of cosmetics L'Oreal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will have to report by March 10, 2010 by saying, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt has been weak and at what periods.
I think she'll be there.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, was on the way out of the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It's an excellent news (...) Expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's single daughter has been prosecuting François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who has been touching him, who has been accused of having benefited for years from his mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always rejected being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the large family package on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer mentioned three letters sent by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You may explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since he got married."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office again considered that the complainant was not eligible to act, especially since a guardian judge had refused in recent days to apply to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees has been pointing to the position of consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a matter of having employees adhere to "values" determined from above as they once were, to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put forward strategies to conquer markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to mortifying demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly managers.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EI "requires all stakeholders ... a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires an undertaking on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion investigations
The internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – will they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many deviations, to do primarily... what it has always done.!
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
They have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology in the major engineering schools.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely distributed, at their inst, by the educational institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "lights" (sic) of the engagement of the executives, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires adopting a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this design of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business by relying on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "Just War" Is Worth the Praises to the Right in Obama · Global Voices
The U.S. right welcomed the speech delivered on Friday to Oslo by Barack Obama, and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had embroidered the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, as was Sarah Palin, the former Vice-President candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, an army of the right wing of the Republican party, in the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that had just been published.
Of course the war is the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be arrested all over there, she has estimated.
Mr. Obama, who inherited from the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had made Oslo "of very good work".
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some points, I found this very historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected person, considered by some as a possible candidate for Republican Investment for the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" reminding the Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not give a peace price if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former lead by George W. Bush reversing chronicler at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to appearing as a "citizens of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a falcon of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, has called the speech "terne, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left side of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we wrap the war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained a commendable place for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still thinking that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily lit up.
Mr. Obama "spoke the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and edifying".
Roads: Three marathons for an agreement that saves the supplies of Christmas
After three Marathon negotiations, the road unions and TLF, the only employer organization to remain to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejouxed" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to start at 11 a.m. so that everyone would agree and the text would be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was to be afraid that it would disrupt the end-of-year parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages by 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and for the highest of 2.9 per cent (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low-income households, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we go very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
So we're going to give our militants orders that there are no locks, no locks at the refueling centres.
But we can always have some recalcitrants that aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, increases will be around 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow for, inter alia, the consideration of the question of a 13th month and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the amending bill for 2009, which was voted on on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply to companies that are members of this organization at first, and to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will be "as soon as possible," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a "dupes market", as the EUR 100 million "have already been promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in urgency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to oppose the turkey eaters of the next awakening, has deplored Unostra.
For the other, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, disgruntled unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban common transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday to the 2nd day strike between trade unions and RATP's management has left them on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of pre-Christmas purchases, there will be only trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a two-way train on the central section (between the Defence and the Nation) and a four-on-four train outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Galleries, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "the RATP is making efforts to serve the big stores".
The RER Through the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short section of RATP from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two circulated at peak hours, and almost no branch in busy hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians had organized themselves.
Thus, in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of colleagues and high schoolchildren.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The station Saint-Lazare did not know of saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned to frame officers and forces of order.
The RRs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "worst" by the unions, of a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The Director of RRs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RRA A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
It is not what drivers want, who demand a first due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its proposals in line with parentheses, the CGT was outraged, stressing that management "was not slow to solve a problem while in road and SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
What also told the unions that the company "was jeopardizing users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a fear of peace".
The conflict threatens to expand to RRB on Tuesday, after a notice has been filed by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions apply for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, including 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions of daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, reach 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros premiums, for delayed schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurd party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdan party, a decision that was immediately followed by outbursts of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the government's task, which has just held hands with the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "household of activities prejudicial to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Hasim Kiliç Court, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously taken by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-vote majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr.Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including his President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Party's Treasury of Property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (about 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court intervenes as the government has just held hands with the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights to try to tarnish the support of the Kurds to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had argued that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in South-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to a clash with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, the great south-east city populated by the majority of Kurds.
The law enforcement forces fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
About a hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk affirmed that the Justice decision was "to deepen hopelessness".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by an Islamic movement party, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This solves nothing, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoes of the government's democratic openness, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
First snows can fall
What Wolfgang Braubger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road-blocking and sanding service (ESF) clearly states that it is not to annoy the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master it.
And according to meteorologists, this could be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack the snow and the frost.
The EDF is following a highly developed plan here.
Mr. Braubger explains that as soon as it snows over the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sanding vehicles travel 20 main routes (called routes A) .
This includes the high traffic streets, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FS officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-attached road base within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the EDF service starts at 3am "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic starts".
That's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, tells us the head of the road deblation and sabotage service "because no driver is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the side streets come last.
Mr. Braubger knows that there are still some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF's walking team starts to get the areas considered dangerous and the crossings first.
With regard to cycle tracks, EDF services are generally not able to deal with this.
Mr. Braubger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 hours and 4h30.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in cases of need.
The birth of dinosaurs
The Tawa Hallae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its lengthened skull was filled with sharp and curly teeth, its short arms ended up with faucille claws and he had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday, the Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the land of the supercontinent, the Pangée and was to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
It informs us of the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the parentheses.
In 2006 Sertling Nesbitt began searching with other paleontologists at Gohst Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the search team tells that sometimes they could find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that part of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named it Tawa according to the word of the many Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however, it states that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
Based on the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Syrians divided into three major evolution groups: the theoropods (carnivores) which include the tyranonosaur and the velociraptor later appeared and whose birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds along the neck, and those related to them and the ornithischiens herbivores of which species such as triceratops and stegosaurus are included.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found clues that the Tawa Hallae had small air sacs in its bones at the skull level, as well as birds that are the offspring of the theoropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa Hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the apparent line of the vast sauropods also had air bags and a light bone, it can be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the most primitive dinosaurs in South America lived, researchers concluded that the sarriens were there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the Pangée Supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advancing the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaure, which lived in present Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken vision because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other sarians.
By the end of the Trias the dinosaurs have spread across the planet, promoting the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, have disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassica.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition in the field.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourable meteorite of a group of animals that had also developed in the course of the Trias, which since then had been in the shadow: these were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt's casino police evacuated the entire planet.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and the South express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the police intervention claimed by the University Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art had been barred from graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable achievement" of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The Steering Committee of the University thus drew attention to discussions that would, however, be essential.
The persons responsible for the course require that the criminal proceedings brought against them be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The youth of the Verdi union of the services sector and the German Confederation of Unions (DGB) are supportive of students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the youth union Verdi.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and cause for action by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is totally unacceptable, she told Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the current television show.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but we do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU Member of the regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Gauche (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about student arguments and demands, we evacuate them.
The La Gauche Party tabled a motion that sums up the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time she was known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weaponry under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic production and research sites are located there.
As of September 2008, the representatives of Zelenograd have created links with Riedberg, the location of the French science – with the universities and the companies of the Frankfurt innovation centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings, and last Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "close collaboration protocol".
The signatories were Moscow Vice-Mary Juri Rosljak and Zelenograd's Anatoly Smimov Prefect for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, Chief of the proposed section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow the FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet institutions and research companies.
The Institute of Electronics in Moscow, the major Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika firms, is located there.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literary translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the sinking of a railway station, than a colossal construction project that will dive into the heart of the capital of Bade-Würtemberg, in a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the minds of the 1980s.
The line-head stations, with tracks ending in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the effect of modern rail traffic brakes because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what we have to do.
That's why the line-heads have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train pass station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Rail Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been not compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, line-heading stations no longer have real entry and exit problems since modern trains exist, reversible with autorails and pilot-car at both ends.
However, we are now launching the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the new trace of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and local policies have taken it.
The railway company is part of the share because it is the taxpayer who is responsible for the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The train station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom we attributed - and it's typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new trace, with its inclinations, does not suit the freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and leverage in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the 180-kilometre Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be very urgent to press the fungus down here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is in the process of becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, which is at the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to consider legally the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the night flight ban in the case or the proposed construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 23 and 5am, such as the Land Government's vision, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to file an appeal against the ruling.
The opposition criticises this time and tries to pressure the representative of the government to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their pledges made prior to the elections and to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, this will be condemned as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir by referring to the Electoral slogan of the FDP "We hold our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's allegations that the Land Government is still attempting to authorize night flights by using "avocassery and redundancies".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition with respect to the statements of its fraction on the night flight ban is completely flawed.
US Banks Reimburse Aid
The large American banks, very affected by the crisis, are disassociated from their links to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over Euros 30 billion), corresponding to the assistance granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported that Citigroup was also considering reimbursement of the aid received.
In this way, banking institutions seek to rid themselves of restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the executives and the higher fee settlement.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which contributed $19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the amount comes from banks that are well-filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, expressly held to thank the US taxpayers: the injection of capital greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by redeeming Merrill Lynch's investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money in the financial markets in order to free itself from the State's guardianship.
The U.S. bank could launch a 20 billion-dollar capital increase on Thursday, according to the CNBC chain citing banking.
The spokesperson of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed their public funds.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened even faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the current position of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Bender has been cleared by the German Chain Board of Administration ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who runs the Berlin writing of ZDF was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm the steward of the ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Bender's contract be extended for five years, but that was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council expressed their support for Bender's reinstatement and 7 others voted against. Bender's vote-out represented a failure that was predictable for Schächter.
The CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already let it hear several weeks before the vote, did not want to re-enter Brender's position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the listening rate for the information broadcasts of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, crushing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had entered the debate and felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the science-political, pedagogy and the Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhenanie-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of all at the news magazine "high-journal" (current newspaper).
Then he continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then he served in Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was the chief editor and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (the bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then the head of the Berlin editor.
After Brender's misfortune, while he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized journal Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
The opponent of Koch to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of personnel of the steward cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck is not planning to request the withdrawal of political personalities from the ZDF Supervisory Committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully worked with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vexency in his decision to limoger Brender.
As a result of this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the Board of Directors could elect it without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal on the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
A partial success for students: after one year of an educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Directors, an agreement was developed stating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to finish their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of the examinations: a single examination should lead to the completion of the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be recognised to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one land to another.
Under-reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and University Rectors have constantly spoken the word "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Every module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of some thirty pages on future terms of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the derailments, which significantly impeded the studyability.
The "studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if this feeling of suffocation cannot be avoided, which is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and scope of manoeuvre necessary to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education put pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programs are not too busy and the review regime is not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations service.
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
This will require only one examination to complete his studies.
The organization of the studies will need to be more flexible, and the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions have been appreciated, but criticism has been heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer take place in the future "back closed doors" of Ministers and university directors.
No later than after the educational strike, students as persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Directors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The students' experience is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Länder Education Ministers with whom HRK works on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and opportunity for each Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure to students today's Bachelors that there will be sufficient places tomorrow for Master's studies and the conditions for studies as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of relieved access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrive in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he feared in breeches of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of collection in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's home of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about it in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your security files".
Clearly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauindorfer, who had collaborated as a political police informant.
Söllner received the German language award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been able to resist the intimidation trials of the Security."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary dividends with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victimized.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, provides the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
"He had been able to get it out of all the difficult situations at the time," said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however, was not so surprising to a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
On the contrary, Germany, where, in the meantime, consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security dossiers is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly countered and slowed down in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was set up to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the return of files has been rather delayed since.
Since 2005 there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The influence of former members of Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of Security in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, is expressing himself in a highly derogatory manner with regard to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many ineluctable questions are associated with the Söllner case as is often the case in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now ? Who has been depleted ? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's audible, suggest that the follow-up of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative came there, shot at four pins coming right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounted at midnight less the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our quinquagenary could have taken the wheel itself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk of happiness either.
He had had a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
'Cause now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that had just been engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to recover."
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions every day.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditive goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Stirred to draw
The eighth final match of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23/24 February/ match return 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be fired on the 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of entry into fulminant function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in the one who had been lucky, who had passed on to destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and pleasure to play.
I went to see the players and I told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "poverty of souls" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so well that no longer had effects on the healer Babbel.
He triggered some magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan, "in the football when there's a new impulse sometimes things happen that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the best player by his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new boss's method of work: "He is someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed its head, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart is in particular in need of tenacity.
Just like Gross, players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a completely outdated defence and weakens Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0:4 , objectta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone through the hard way yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is from the events of the weekend that a TV interview of the goal watchman Jens Lehmann made rebound just before the beginning of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens would counter Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He had accused the management of weak style and said that she had decided to change trainers under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of free time after the matches had been removed from him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" focused Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for the life of these two quadragenaries.
In any case, they agreed for the rest, i.e. without the pre-work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong sport and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in success" returned to Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in Acquiesça plastic bag.
World heavyweight championship
Hot fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger continually provoked the Vitali Klitschko world champion.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight world champion title according to the WBC Federation version.
At the same time as the judges, he imposes himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its world heavyweight champion title.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points at the same time as judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the World Championship title WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately he did not succeed the KO so expected.
Klitschko, released 39 times the winner in 41 professional fights, has twice his defeat for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2,02 meters, by its left.
Johnson, of eleven centimeters smaller that, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the shots of the champion, thus forcing Klitschko to bring into play his dangerous right-hand.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mainly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He was still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the "evil zombie" treatant who "is not really capable".
During the heavy Friday, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko returned to his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had at the time beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "sa" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without fighting.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a break in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a WBO and IBF federation champion.
But it is British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko that was to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional society is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
The opposition's frontal attack: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) parties ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition appealed to the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for having deliberately hidden certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a breach" on the deadly strike of two tank trucks last September," said the Chief of the Greens Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the release of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the attack was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's survey report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the U.S. air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche asked on Saturday chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to make a statement as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague for the Greens Renate Künast feel that Ms. Angela Merkel must state clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejected these criticisms.
The chancellor in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were increasingly voiced to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had submitted to Guttenberg concerning the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have hidden the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The presence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, and a report of the military police, has been reported to the Department of Defence.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have in the meantime requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, no response has been received
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry that would be constituted the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is only in psychic patients, or under the drug effect, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can unhinder ourselves from the most insane dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who wakes up has the dream state experience, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices only appear in psychic patients or under the effects of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious awakening state, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, the psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenia psychosis.
The earth's attraction force has no more power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always pondered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of a dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a character of a comic strip.
Its body is in two dimensions with the colors created.
Earth's attraction has no more power over it, it's flat on the ceiling.
He's feeling a bit.
Behind him were creatures of evil winged, gruesome, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They follow him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain throughout his body.
A loud, mean, loud voice, coming out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo chain, in fact a loop and attachs it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is detaching.
That you need a lesson, cry out the voices in a choir to pick up the tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself taken care of!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniac-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which makes them suffering from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tangle of ideas and ghosts coming from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is located in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like in a dream, surmounted by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
To experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real environment.
Why does our brain do this kind of goat, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a few people will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the individuals involved present infamous brain damage.
It is assumed that neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what is still unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, though there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain is warm.
What's crazy, Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck tells us is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
The hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are psychic disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that in some circumstances even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not cool enough; when our brain warms but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of the participants acknowledged that they had done at least once in their lives the experience of hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town in Mecklemburg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A young girl just to be normal to be true.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, long-haired, speaks to him.
When she answers her friends look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her bench.
She can even discern her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this nice young man.
I'm crazy, she's wondering sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, appearances are usually frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new pupil in her eyes and ears while she is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the painting.
At night, appearances are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that happens too rarely and very late, she can't often make the distinction if she's awake or dream already, if the images she sees, the faces screaming or the girl with bloody laces on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd think she'd be crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She had her bowl last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been online with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has insufficient stimulation, the probability is great that he has hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain is not busy enough, so there's an animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 years of age, that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "is taking place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally distinguish themselves from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenes, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, there is a tendency to take imaginative experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also containing something positive, creative - madness is a work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of changing the consciousness awakened by the dream.
Onroids are very complex semi-rives that are perceived as real by the one who sees them and cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests during trauma or in extreme pathologies situations as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, they experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity of organization that is given to us, to men, so as not to sink into the naught of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichn Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his dreamy experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time of his conscious departure for a trip of several days after the operation of a cardiac valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain still in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world that he has created of all parts, visits of foreign places, travel through time. He sees himself as an old man who is drawn into a railway sanatorium, a robot at his head looking after his health.
He lives at the middle of his life among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is taken away by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
He absorbs himself completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these inland trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he has experienced.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even from years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real life.
The intensity of this experience sparks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, onroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the external reality are even in a state of vigilance.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be equally enriching.
First snows can fall
Burd
At 27 years of age, children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wishes his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain at 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly committed to integrating society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All details have been sorted out in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of it.
Children cannot be imposed on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to care for them.
This would tear down children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director-General as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, aged 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is in charge of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 to 15 years"
Burda states that the holding should remain 100% in the family's hands.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been trained by a capital bulimia, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself as a preceptor of the country as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can desire, in matters of beauty and well-being, within reach of hand.
This is the purpose of the quesemble set itself El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the mall of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, a laser hairdressing specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a dietary ray, with in particular a tea room, which offers over 130 different types of tea.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own Beauty Party with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where care can be provided for the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
All begins with introducing your personal code to a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to do our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heat and stretch included) are enough to make all muscles work.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of repairing hair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be opened every day in the year from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Varied removals
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the colletity, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with the electric car
Endesa, in collaboration with the City Hall of Barcelona, created the "Live Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, by taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electrical cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville come to join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, under the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed an agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa has taken to promote the electric car.
The company is taking part in standardisation groups at European level and is undertaking a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT Verde.
Zapatero interviews "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, spoke of "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures undertaken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan of the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Through this plan and the decision of the trade marks to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Internal Plan for the Motor Sector (IPA), devoted €800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand-support measures, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, the plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "high increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of collection cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
It will not only be possible to find motorcycles and collection cars, but it will also be found in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind related to the world of the engine.
For example, from the exponents of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Mos Classics and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Classics, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the trade activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with cars and motorcycles of collection will also take place on a specially designed circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect to the environment.
For this purpose, it has just incorporated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horse petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score she has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Golf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
This compact Japanese car has more than enough living space to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large box with regular shapes.
The engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and with manual change of the six speeds.
This motor is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not make a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive one, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
The serial equipment includes the track change assistant (RVM) which removes dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed controller, photosensitive interior mirror, on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels.
Furthermore, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements of bi-xenon adaptable lighthouses and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "first"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch its email, without providing the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half of what costs, for example, iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American brother-in-law, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafe on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) in order to consult their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it should have worked for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
The European Commission's repeated calls for affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had an impact which is hardly perceptible.
Outside its home country, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no installment.
It is a connected device and is paid during purchase and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a life-access buying option like Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I wanted to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more fair formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office in the U.S. presidency with a dress and a coat of that color, she has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany her in the second, undoubtedly the most important moment of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model on these two occasions: apart from their similar color, a yellow to the green with brilliant reflections, twice, the dress was made up of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, although at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States followed the seat of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth for the take-up function, on the other hand, it carried a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first opportunity, and a similar but golden model, this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised as it was worn off the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is evident from the study "Fecuity and Professional Career of Women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted in 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have experienced limited careers due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment they work for.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are forced to enter life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35 to 49 who have fixed jobs have their first child, on average 3.7 years after they have settled in marriage, and this number goes to 4.1 in those who work in the public sector."These data show that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which has led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the starting date of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that increases the age of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those who did elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have conducted basic studies get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done secondary or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it well
The Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors : Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, coining the universal motto "Because I am worth it."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, joins other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last ones to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, both yesterday and today, met for the annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
Ash poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, Fernando Vicente's illustrations) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographic summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent saves neither the friars nor the lights.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the one I felt without name: pleasure against mortal destiny, morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic mood, dazzling, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh from which he conjured the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven by the path of loss."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still let go and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a land owner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Those two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the demented cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he made it in the flight of himself and invoking the postority with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed: "God loved me, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the worms of Spenser: "Sus sleep after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired of death revived."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband would very normally agree that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent went beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it was to try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What would Benet do if it wasn't Baroja's rifle by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestrian?"
A coward attack
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a honey-stained blood, rescued from the SPA and did not weigh more than six kilos, and without saying, they sat at him two strokes that left the dog severely injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don't see what's funny about assaulting a defenseless little animal free of charge, which was also left behind.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person less than he.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at the precinct even if we doubt that this is of great use and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to state that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet port
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the helmet port, mainly among the younger bikers, as the two structures indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protection element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which "exceeds the design and manufacture of increasingly secure products" and stated that it contributed to this objective by other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet encouragement campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the concessionaires.
However, the good news should be cancelled, since the comparison reference in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, the accumulated registrations during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (from passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Large clouds that affect most of their demand have not dissipated; indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through external funding.
In addition to the restrictions on bank credit, other factors such as rising unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic environment need to be added.
In the face of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit from this, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, the need for the administration to attach particular attention to these vehicles and to industrial vehicles (lorries and buses) was reiterated.
The association of the concessionaires provides for a year similar to the year ending in 2010, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of tourism vehicles and of the 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has happened with the ABS braking system and with the ESP stability control, emergency braking systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
Moreover, they are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, even though, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always hold the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four fatalities with wounded would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device shall exert the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejects the Opel plan until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, said that each point of the plan had been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is important.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Flying from the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewels, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and succeeded in reducing it from nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, first, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual built roof, allowing them to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports boats, 12 kilos more, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they renounced the CDR-30 audio system, winning six more kilograms and replaced the handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: It has been a long time since we had tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees such security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles to small speed during the time necessary, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push again his engine...
It's out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as specified, the car will do as our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine rusting, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a presence on the whole journey, while on some turns we found glass in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, the funniest to drive and which is much more than just a change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70,831.
Bag Girl
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer displays her face as bad as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a winning victory at 91-82 during his visit on the hard terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences that the team of Dusko Ivanovic suffered. It is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team has been able to fill Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov's major absences by a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three marked points, largely determines the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the leading artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to notice himself as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although Splitter's "less six" evaluation had already suggested that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilians.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that they didn't win so easily on their ground, and thanks to Elias' hand, they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making yellows take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being killed, needed to chain a few useful actions to take the air, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas returned the meter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter-time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play the whole for the last period and English and San Emetio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not sign up and tried to support her from the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Wounds Prevent Unicaja From Delivering Battle
Unicaja has lost a lot of noise in Greece in the face of the Olympicos and has given him the head of group B of the Euroliga, during a game marked by the absence of players from the Unicaja, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
Malaga's team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the rival's size, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The first quarter-time game made the Andalusian dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio that dazzled the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, led to the reversal of the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of battle, between North American drivers Beverley and Williams led to disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began operating by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The domestic players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage, at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the loss of 19 years, showed himself superior and even equalized the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, which chanced the group's head.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and to Lewis' support, gave a little hope with 66-57, at thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because the Olympiacos proved implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded in raising the score at 81-62, at thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know what salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles ads in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates user wages from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week after the application works, the search engine has found that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a communiqué the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are less well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a Frenchman, 31,059, while a Spanish man receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver earns EUR 34 247 gross per year in England, EUR 25 751 in France and EUR 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of a server, with 11 592 euros net per year, followed by that of a seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most popular Internet jobs over the past three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The reversing president will have to abandon the diplomatic law by 27 January 2010 at the latest, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business for the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, on the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya denied the status of political exile intended to impose on him the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets constituted the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty arose again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets was to monetaryize the debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by providing liquidity at close rates to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without jeopardising their non-conformist liquidity policy, they are beginning to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award at one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a further revision of the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral risk defenders, who were once again trying to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of limiting credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle among emeritus to restore its place in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to roses.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be quite unreasonable for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country not to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry about it.
If European differences were to decline and our differences continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our forecast indicators require most study services to anticipate their revival models and to revise their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which are responsible with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to constitute an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for now "safety is a mother of security".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had referred to before the subcommittee, at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion until 2020 and an additional EUR 60 billion between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants are now in operation.
If that were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue has changed, and power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that another 18,000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is a "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "point-point" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they put some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the air Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Akiona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona is struggling for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The project at stake is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-mile long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Akiona to settle in the country as a public works company and a highway dealer.
The city hall wishes to be able to dispose of this by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, within the framework of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million) and in the final phase three consortia are faced, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish smooth company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second one, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the Actiona team, the consortium Northern Direct was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French manufacturer Bouygues group.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large yards and privatizations, but entering it is a major challenge, if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and still remains an unwarranted step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just won a seat in this market by its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, Leighton's owner.
Millionaire assets
Actiona focused on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, which already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Victoria, Waubra (192 MW), and runs the grouping of companies to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City Infrastructure Office of Brisbane and the said Northern Link (northern link), is called to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project in place to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule established by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll route will be open for traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two-fold tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide US$500 million (308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company gave way to the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. The works have not yet started and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is granted the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it was commissioned to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for an amount of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the project is planned for early 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is going to award Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of approximately €3 million per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from one of the 16 agencies that presented themselves to Renfe's call for tender, including four of which were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A 63 million fine in France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined €63 million in France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, accumulates more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore re-decidive.
An Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone subsidiary followed the wake-up of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing the revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that have seized the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, but it is also one of the main sources of income from major clubs.
The competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA's information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to reach the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the previous European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams that also made the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And this, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in more than 550 00 euros for each contested game.
There is also a win bonus (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those arriving in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams arriving in the fourth final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million and no more than 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça charged 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractions.
The previous year's champion is 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid on the basis of the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29,9% of Sos.
The Nova Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the bid for shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 per cent of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at EUR 1.85; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has ensured that it has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that it has contacted the regulator.
If it did, the disbursement would amount to $611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is $254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues the restructuring of his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and of the going and coming court of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that made the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's Exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The monitoring body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in accordance with the current standards and that it considered "sufficient" the content of the explanatory sheet submitted, following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed, and that they could in no way be transmitted prior to the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these bad days and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including the parts and the work force can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are devoted to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then process them and offer them to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solara, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, because we need to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is drawn from each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car.
If it is a massively sold model, work can be done within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-sale car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they include information about the Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With respect to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centres throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, France, China and Japan), each of which specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to make different uses and offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing cashiers or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadax does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use little, not more than ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow for the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is removed from the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to rent on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a break or how many severe disasters occurred for a given period.

Internet auctions of injured cars

The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an immense international market.

Collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex approaches.
Four-step garage debt
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search the replacement piece, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 tolls, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then the necessary piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increments or reductions, then he can print the quote to give it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audadex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
