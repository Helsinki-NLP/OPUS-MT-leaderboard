This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional disposition.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the top and of pale or carotenoid color on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but show other characteristics specific to the feathers – beards and beards – the researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development after these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that it was not used in flight but rather for the regulation or display of temperature. Researchers suggested that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the duvet of a chick.
The scientists state that this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young person.
A trapped car exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and hurting more than twenty other people.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the black matter of the galaxy and the black matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that the black matter affects the other black matter in the same way as the normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the black matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multi-resistant tuberculosis (TB-MR) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he stated that the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients reportedly contracted the virus to the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were part of the hospital staff.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in a envelope a pre-printed paper sheet indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers checked his identity, the elector threw the envelope into the urn and signed his voter card.

Candidates can send representatives to attend every step of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high surveillance, depending on specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a did not finish (DNF) during her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in the tenth place of the group of women seated with a combined time of 4:41.30, or 2:11.60 minutes less than Austrian Claudia Loesh, arrived first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, arrived ninth.
In the category of women in ski seats, four skiers did not finish their course; with regard to the giant slalom, 45 skiers over a total of 117 in this race did not succeed in classifying themselves.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the laptop and the stolen mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we recovered his phone and his laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, Commissioner of Police, said that the accused had their face hidden when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present at the house when the car hit him, none were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road in which the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow relief services to extract the driver from the Audi TT red.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Cambridge Hospital Hospital.
Adekoya has since been charged with murder of his son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was on the lookout for her trial and examination, but the eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait was very publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told journalists that no further comment will be made until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the borders that existed before the war in the Middle East of 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority consents only for a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park and heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were duly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly introduced a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country in new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the broad protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed him of 34 additional overheating incidents, that the company had qualified as "non-serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's adjournment as "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marians at 7.19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariann Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre stated that there was no sign of tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took hostage from tourists from Hong Kong by diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shoots with his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Several hostages were saved, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and started a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
The Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or black boxes) on Wednesday.
The other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "The moon was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two Mondays. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "The moon was as weird as me... even more... I love her and she's going to miss me... I hope she's resting in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into the Republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 per cent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was to swim at 100 m and 200 m free swimming and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome his pain, as these were prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25th the largest number known to date.
Several people checked the discovery using different materials and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cômo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and signed last month a bill to legalize marriage between same-sex people.
He described rumors as "above and political nonsense."
It is believed that he will present himself to the Presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly at shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, not on previously used ground radar systems, which allows air controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The extra transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking lots and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport has given rise to the possibility that the game can play in private, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published in the journal Science Thursday reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated much longer, following the reproduction of an endemic Darwin pine, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-beak immigrant pine, Geospiza conirotris.
We can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be drawn in fine thread, which can be twisted and twisted. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate the painted images by hand in the books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can manufacture an indicator using red chou juice.
Chou juice changes colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed from their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, press them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water hunt in almost all houses, linked to a sophisticated sewer system.
remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the mining towns of Crete and Santorin in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women were side by side.
When you call a person who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought to us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other goats.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free company cats) who eat small prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task returned to each feline, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called cocks.
The stock consists of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, with a large number of sisters and girls in their families.
Lion troops act like wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big feline) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Athlete balanced, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump large distances and treat with five times the force of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (like Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones able to roar.
The tearing of the tiger does not look like the broad roar of the lion, but rather to a phrase whose words would be screams and growlings.
Ocelots are crawling with small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, the ocelots track and find animals to eat (preys) by smelling, reinvigorating their journey on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also travel very furtively. Ocelots track their prey by basing themselves in their environment before they throw themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population of which it came (for example, if it moves over a range of mountains or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return back), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this "specification" process, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We manufacture our homes and plant-based clothing. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the super-preventor of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosaics.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palace, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the fork tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaics, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not large against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual party dishes, including bloodstains, breads, snails, and lair, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the women ate their food by sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they sat on the side while they ate their meals.
Antiquity Romanesque meals could not include these American or Asian foods that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a major temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open court, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggorates, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of the Hebrew family were taking place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters giving on the street. The houses were stone buildings.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red has been exiled from Iceland for murder that he has found Greenland — and has named it — by traveling more westward.
But regardless of its discovery, scheming tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "candinative", there are many differences between peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the Benjamin Gates film and the Treasurer of the Temples, you may think that a treasure card has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is a record on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776”. The text is at the bottom of the document, on the other hand.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parkin (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters of 24 inches) was stored.
It is therefore likely that notation was added simply as a label.
The landing of the day J and the following battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupant instead of confronting her.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Dragon Operation.
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Free France Forces had released the south of France and were heading to Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by an important group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means great city or city-state, and which also indicates, in some ways, the size of the society to which it relates.
The cities-States are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it referred to the authorities of the State, often under-cooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws and customs laws between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian National Football Team, with the German National Team, was the second largest team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball-ball, water-polo, cream, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often designated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipel".
The first information regarding Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passed there referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of Aboriginal cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat during the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which he gave way to Taiwan's sovereignty in Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the complex's adjacent buildings have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most popular film format at the end of the analog era.
It is still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is in fact, and is quite disconcerting, 36 mm width per 24 mm height.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest of the ratios of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is highly abused and often turned into ridicule, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked the European States to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the roturier.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the beginning of the hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters in order to prevent ships from adventure in entire maritime areas, thus a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic only caused a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its unlimited underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred on his behalf, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former director) to Thomas Edison's attention.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different times; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most known of these periods is the time of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place among many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of the Chinese Antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI years.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to just one leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other oppressed working classes from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) mountain for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual penchants.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of La Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists. When we entered the cave, we're completely isolated.
Above, nothing can be seen other than the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see or hear only very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium before J-C, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honour of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Gizeh Plateau, or "Gizeh Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, brings together several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small graves, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his women and family members.
The "pulse" symbol is similar to a V and the "draw" symbol is a staple or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the arch, and the bottom means you have to start with the increase (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the arch.
An arch to the top usually produces a softer sound, while an arch to the bottom is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to register your own brands in the pencil, but do not forget that the printed arche marks are for a musical purpose, and that they should in general be respected.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the King, Mrs. Elizabeth, all terrified, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of sellers.
In a body, they entered Paris surrounded by crowds of people who scream and scream threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their body bodies.
At one point, a crowd member branded the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interests of the obligations issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the extra-profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that has led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – the period of history in current Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological growth or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of mankind is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technology determinism are based on two general ideas: technology development itself takes place according to a process that largely exceeds cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also results in a greater impact of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romantism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have appeared; these, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would have been preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered to be that of the feudal Europe.
His reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted up to about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that the Crusaders were responsible for gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the capital title of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style has experienced its height between the Xth and XIVth centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could be delayed from 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest progress of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a farming practice to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system, using preserved seeds originating in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers used subsistence agriculture, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Sub-cultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by social norms and share the same ideas that enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Sub-cultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex of members.
The criteria that determine sub-culture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a sub-culture often report their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manierisisms and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to inspire a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by individuals (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability of which the child suffered.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When they are fully raised by non-human species, wild children show behaviours (in the limits of their physical provisions) almost identical to those of animals that have raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project education should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but more a way to help learners who discover new learning such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man of Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, through extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We see the family placement system as a safe haven for these children.
Our host family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Host family placement is supposed to provide all the requirements that were lacking in the home from where they were previously removed.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered as major factors for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The president's speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such ability to interpret human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes the reserve from the expressed variations.
The segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its needs in amino acids from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
By contrast, food of animal origin (formis, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way as the savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of intentional awakening during your sleep period and relaxation shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without completely awakening you.
If you find yourself reinitiating the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
The other possibilities based on biorrhythm include drinking plenty of liquids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known as diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital strength present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini's energy (lighting energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is thanks to the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleaned, activated chakras, and the consciousness of awakening created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their various systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in both Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retire and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
But these plans became obsolete almost every day the next day, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the carriage of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Marines' work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-Boots, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats had been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagro Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that were wandering on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by goats who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the best known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still ongoing today.
The "cars" were built in England since the 16th century.
Although the tracks for cars were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and pull higher loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The intersections were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was not long before that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first means of locomotion was the walk: humans began to walk standing two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australians, did not walk as usual.
Biped specializations are found in Australian fossils 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in a better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even military in order to mitigate future sufferings.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by humans, and that problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a manuscript project signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets from there, to John Dunlap's printery.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people regard them as dinosaurs, giving them wings and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on handling information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough to prevent immediate diagnosis.
The best index of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
Consult the label for first-aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed-pangs, which are very suitable insects for pesting humans.
The reducers, as well as the bed beatings, are nidicals, that is, adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (SEP), making it the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their best interests, nor in the child's interest, to care for the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, the experiment, and an experience is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumptions, ask questions and make observations, but also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West has been cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
Hershey and Chase experience was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations may have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and if the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information are examples of activities on site.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orang-outs of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural cities by car to go to their workplace and believe other people who will work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow linked to a passenger-based transport system and supports it.
Science has now shown that this carbon-based massive economy has shifted the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably coherent range; therefore, circulation flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented approximately.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of road installations.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and to find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to recapture their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot catch their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water on the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Gizeh were never exceeded by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican City is drafting its legislation and official communications in Italy.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since antiquity, people have become familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are in nature in crude form and are simple enough to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, these were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also issued the theory that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when he went out.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new drafting methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rare uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil-size.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next news comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by collecting a core of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like we're going to climb a hill with a heavy cart. By dividing the nucleus again, then releasing a little of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break down with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is finer at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories are focused on what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature toward adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, motivates them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs and the theory of the two factors of Herzberg.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the head of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "good partner" (or good girlfriend).
This type of manager is having trouble making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting assessments, entrusting responsibilities, and holding others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unknown individual who feels that he/she has to change everything that the group has created up to then and do things in its own way.
After all, the chief is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often results in divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to take on the annoying process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the client.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, tumors and trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The further development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and equipment to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly known as science-fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer sciences that study the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and questions, and the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to separate disciplines, focusing on the contribution of solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been put into place in several computer and video games software.
The excursions are an integral part of any class of school. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outputs. Students can look at the old objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb artwork while remaining seated with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to think about a trip and share his experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "obligs students to know the world around them better."The need for public interest motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When good use is made, blogs "can enable students to strengthen their analytical capacities and critical minds: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with others and express their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara falls and north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be Canada's quintessence.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more Afro-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent alone, with regard to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be resorts of luxury.
The Arabs have also brought Islam's practice to the land, and this religion has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the road to Cape Town that links Europe to India.
To the north, the region is delimited by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended to any woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also recommended to have an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women need to realize that some cultural differences can result in behaviors they consider as harassment. It is in fact common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the refusal of men's advances, and be not afraid to hold fast (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the Xth century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed it had rebuilt and baptized Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to make purchases.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as taxis, pots, Moroccan goods, narguilés and bibelots of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the streets of the city, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for trailing tracks of mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use wedding-boda (moto taxi) to move to Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tombuktu" has become a metaphor for remote and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, it is divided into 14 ecozones, each containing a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous attraction parks in South Africa and is considered to be the flower of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation rights for the park.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that gives access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong territory and represents the main focus for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a graphic with shimmering bars, which is reflected in the waters of the port of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the seafront of Kowloon in front of you.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the Plains of the North Bank.
This is where British settlers have invested, so this seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the behind Bangladeshi and Indian countries.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
Forests, however, are not only made up of mangrove marshes; they also reflect some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gange Plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about one third of which is covered by water/seaming zones.
Sundarbans has been a natural reserve since 1966, you can find about 400 tigers from the Royal Bengal and 30,000 tacheted deer.
Buses leave from the interdistrict road station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often complete, and it is also recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to close places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock is a hauban bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers are 83 meters high; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical detachment under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was only opened for circulation in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that is now east of Paraguay, living as semi-nomad hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurús or the Payagús, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of India", was born from the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo grounds of Las Caníitas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller games are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo games, see the Association Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the book of the Falkland Islands (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a currency commonly accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighbouring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if the British and American currencies may be. Talk ahead with the owners to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Malouines' money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There aren't really rainy and dry seasons: precipitation is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to humans, these are wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, it is necessary to hold at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals!
As many docile as they can appear, the bison, the elan, the orignal, the bear and almost all great animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance, and these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly celebrated naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were flown, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful assembly that was held in a city during the struggle of independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow to bathe safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in downtown Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Bathing there is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better traveling.
You can drink local tap water safe, but you can easily find bottled water if you have fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "coffee cream" is foreign. A short black is a "expresso", cappuccino is full of cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all panels and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the boisterous jellyfish arrive near the beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would get away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is found in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transportation from/to the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also retain the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or to obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any change or request must, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are over on the main scenes, other musical shows can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, make sure to check the location of the cabin, because the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers in the cruises are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits may be hard to detect.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them on the spot.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer alcoholic drinks free of charge. Nevertheless, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who travels by car at high or free latitudes of mountain hills should consider the possibility of snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On iced and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on the naked asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfalls or dustiness or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicles.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and circulation is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, particularly in the savannah, with the aim of attending the show capturing wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A foot safari (also called "walking in fog", "safari on foot" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, typical tickets cost about 7,000 yen.
Wetwear can be used to dry them more easily. Many hotels have a iron and iron board that can be ready, even if not in the rooms.
If you don't have to iron or if you don't want to wear iron socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you find one.
Avoid allowing overheating (which can cause shrinking or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, you just boil the water for a minute; in others, you have to do it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle with a well-known company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals they do not know in their region of origin.
Pesticides may contaminate food, cause irritation or, in most cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.

Travelers to countries where taxes are high may sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, passing frequently through remote terrain from the back.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow paths and narrow curves dominate.
The speed limitations displayed are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their stricter respect is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are cooked and cooked in pastry throughout the year, while cherry and plums point the end of their noses in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often particularly good with a cup of coffee.
If you want little but copied pastries, try Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to the regions.
A curry is a dish with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish may be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.

Indonesia has 17,000 islands, and Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualification, it tends to designate food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, the Javanian cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanians prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (in particular Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The drawers are support for the rider's feet, which hangs on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a rider is designed from a horse, but has a foot taken in the back, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, including the English, have safety bars that allow a stranger to fall from the saddle if she is pulled back by a knight who falls.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas on the mountains are impressive. The mountaineers around the world are constantly discovering new, practical paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Descent winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding to unwind a snowed track with skis or snowboarding attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called "ski booms", who organize their entire vacations based on skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years B.C.!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first ski club of leisure was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to mountain skiing, as well as mountaineering, but it does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practised on rugged terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel distances a little larger than on foot – but you will only rarely reach the cross-country ski speeds without a heavy back bag on damaged tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In conventional circumstances, travelling across several countries therefore requires several visa applications and having to undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little as one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without passing through the passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to request a visa separately for each of the space member countries, thereby saving time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years of age as antiques.
The criteria vary from place to place; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than the age limit in Europe.
Artisanal products may be considered antiquities, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of subsistence for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all the Sami were not involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as animals of trait.
Today, many Samas practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sama region.

Travelers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their region of destination, knowing that this may have an impact on the routes they are considering.
Anyone considering travelling to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search of "Visitive Environment Course" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the questions discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
A training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes a weapon-handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers who provide for a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have in their possession documents valid for their return trip.
The willingness of Governments to issue passports whose sex is not stated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and sex varies.

Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to pass the scanners by preserving their privacy and dignity.
The rip-off currents are the currents that come back waves that break off on the beach, often on a tail or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a quick stream to the deep waters can be formed there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim counter-current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, the return to the swim is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible, depending on your skills and whether or not you have been identified, you may want to wait for help.

Travelers who have had a hard time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty adapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost certain habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the beginning of the show.
Usually, there is always the sound of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a book of history.
The Sphinx is placed as the background canvas and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands of the South, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include the Island of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded boiler of a volcano still active offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the sea of Bellingshausen.
The peninsula mountains melt into the plateau, then reappear to form the Elsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinelle chain, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the massif of the Vinson, which reaches 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephone.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who have a Sabbath year have the opportunity to learn by traveling, and more and more of them choose this opportunity.
This formula is especially appreciated by young people who leave school because it allows them to take a year of leave before the university, without compromising their studies.
Often, following a sabbatical year courses abroad can in fact give you a better chance to pursue higher education in your country.
In general, registration fees are required to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for navigation of pleasure. The "Thousands of Lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even kayak offer a different experience.
The navigation of pleasure is a national time pass in Finland, because of a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a single case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most of the Baltic cruises are characterized by a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go to the ground with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009 onwards).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some travel brochures. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit of the city is included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never stolen before or experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is not different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience in other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repair, the issue of deadlines is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related to it.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air cargo, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass unloading and customs.
The only way to get it done faster was to send it as registered baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send luggage without passengers, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek reductions for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can rely on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very much the privileges of speed and comfort, and they establish their tariffs in knowledge of cause.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
