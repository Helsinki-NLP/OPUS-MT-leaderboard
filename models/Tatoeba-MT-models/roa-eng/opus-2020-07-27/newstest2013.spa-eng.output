A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy because of the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, from 2009, new laws that made the process of registration difficult or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has been expanded following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the period of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the polling day and withdraw their right to vote from the criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state demanded that voters submit an identity document with photography.
The Indian State was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities therefore rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported draft laws in 34 states to force voters to present an identity document with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, unlike what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any identity document with photograph issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's still more.
In many states students, the voters who most vote for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004 no state demanded the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that undermined the registration of voters on the same day of polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new electors falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the period of vote in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics it would be exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of the electors, which amounts to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Prosecutor's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this respect, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Is the test done or not done?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to doubt men, already reluctant to themselves, about whether or not detection tests should be done.
Is the test done or not?
We have asked for advice from two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a high level of contagion among sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among the patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40 per cent of possibilities for metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options must be given to him and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, in which case one should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be performed.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority in spite of a decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
The power supply
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they raise the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Charcuteria products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to CSC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his or her doctor.
"The screening test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs Boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less evil" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson foretold by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be few, and we'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and not try it too hard, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "state" consisting, in large measure, of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we meet the good citizens called Fermion, who wisely comply with Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand are the bosnes, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Article Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosunas, I would like to stress here, are not the exotic bugs that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "messager" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "power bearers" bozens.
More stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" so that this boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN (the great bores collider is a 27 km circle ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never be held by itself at the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (how photon, by the way), do not have it.
However, what "can you bring" all these investigations? asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
For its part, many strongly want them to be found, as the least difference could open a door to a "new physics" that tapes certain holes of the model.
This, we must say, is still enormously lacking, as it proposes no explanation of gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of such investigations on our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that you will have none.
For you to see: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered rather a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also come from all the research tools around them.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this capturer now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir's been trying to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've already been seven," says one pass, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which came the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused damage: a huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on your own.
Sitting in front of an appetite for lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, she even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to her, bring medicine to her, and offer her a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is walking," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to their childhood, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide "careful" care.
The greatest fear of 89-year-old Mrs. A. is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has revealed its children.
"I have some good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in this life," he says, before I accept that a mask is placed on him to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit from your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food support.
They are palliative care that they are given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying man is offered mouth-hunting with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, her son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old youth dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick with cancer," concerns Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
Some 77% of Canadians simply lack access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a sick person reaches the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in the hospital or at a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to adopt a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate its opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
" Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without having done what is needed to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was so sorry I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients requesting death are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereu, head of palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep to the moment of their death, either sporadic or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelenting disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
This report has been made possible through a journalism scholarship by Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate registers in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fund collectors of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia account, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
A "industry" which was too expensive for Quebecers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious how the system sprays once we have hunted the great media," ironies Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the misdemeanours connected to road contracts in Quebec, that the liberal prime minister of that time, Jean Charest, had consented only to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while he hopes to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of interventioners, researchers and government analysts.
This unit also operates with police officers from "Marteau Squadron", who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the sewerage" moderate in in inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has registered in series accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outlying city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his seat as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that bribes have been committed repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of procurement.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambia distributed money to disbursed and sinister during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also agreed to have organized a collection of illegal funds for the former liberal prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and corporate bribes from the construction sector for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he incurred.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his dirty money arches.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that made the alarm ring.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, it has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased by $5 million and sold by 1.6 million to developers in full real estate boom.
70% of electoral campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says she pulls "out of a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits."
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is concerned above all about the role of "elect politicians in the stream of the stratagem."
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironic: "I've been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, he says, "while electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "we cannot fall down below; go to the bottom of things, bravely, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story permeates the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look into the mirror.
"PSG isn't the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
I advance from day to day next to you.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't calm down.
From my beginnings at INF Clairefontaine's preformation center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on to vigorous steps.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has given me a great deal about my position.
It is supported by attachments like Claude Makeelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and it is among the best trainers in Europe.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think other titles will be held in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon took off our position as leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have classified ourselves for the eight finals with style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say about many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first ones of our league in front of the Port in order to receive the return of eight of the end.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is dedicated to its means to ensure that this project is implemented.
Wouldn't win the cup in League 1, as in the last season, make a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts to wear that title of champions.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to end first.
We had a tough time.
We're done with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better time.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the guns to take it to us.
Do you think the media expect more of the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We totally accepted it.
After we've won 4-0 at Troyes' house, they still have things to blame for is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Champions we have shown that we can answer and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for the eighth of the end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "pulted" by this new PSG.
That proves League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We better say we have a "Zlatandependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he targets many goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's proven on all the teams he's gone through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows all of us to make progress.
How have you lived the 2012 Eurocopa with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is because we have exemplary behaviour today.
What view do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "bleus"?
You're getting results.
They are well located in the classification group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved its goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin quotation, having arrived at the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to round the ten dollars (the quotes are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive at all if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even sometimes change).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and treats changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both deposits of accounting books, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file sliced, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "throat" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular fingerprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the 100th century, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its heights.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in storage.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject this type of payments.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "gangish scribbles" were launched.
"Thousands of $30,000 have been changed," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a textbook on that coin, believes quite much in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in trades, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", requires Pierre Noizat, which ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement of review of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose, but in 2013 there might be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which today are considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished most of all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the Jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arabs, the Uzbek and the Tajiks join in their causes.
Tolerados, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was made in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no flow of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants overstepped by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The very old, the current government and the present Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making themselves government land to sell them as solar for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: the capital escape is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are keen on mobile phones. Television and its Turkish handbills presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about rebuilding the provincial militias, who will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of the Western nations; however, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has reestablished its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing occurs except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed enormous mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take hold of them.
Without energy to extract the minerals of iron or copper from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the vast Buddha-place and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Chimic), abolished in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain resorts.
These works, greedy for local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What are we going to leave as I recall after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often situated more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which grants it provisional full powers, he decided to play the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given that Assembly two more months to finish his work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used an interim text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial misappropriation.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues "treasoning his word" and "footing the law."
By their supporters, it is ensured that this is a step to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote on my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in large majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not go to the summons.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not put their views into practice.
Human rights representatives, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added to the morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I had hoped, the articles voted were unanimously.
The commentators, on the other hand, are pleased that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's watch was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to all looks, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the norms", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals view it as hypocrisy and believe it is nothing more than an art of advertising.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm his compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next director of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
Most jurists who have worked in that text are not ugly but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But recognize that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, as the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, Ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule over all of this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
The prosecution of civilians in military courts will also not be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be libertic.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could lead to serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, points out Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive step was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to leave last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state expressed themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the Holy Land, the shadow of the world and a sea of salmon
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine in the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (latinian "Dolorous Way").
It begins in the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues along the streets of the Old City, it goes to the Holy Sepulchre in Mount Gólgota, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombudsman of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their desires, which will then come true.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by your own means, only those who engage in climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Up to there, from the foot of the hill are offered bus services.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On a single trip you will not be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos de Qumran, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judaea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has paintings of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath-museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides and no souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free, and categorically no donations are accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children ' s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustains even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to pass treatment courses with salt water, brine and curative bars and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their nerve fractures in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Old Age
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
She passed through the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this was where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your symbol "meism", the fortune will be for you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently $1-3.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a quick tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night until Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb meat, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are soft chick balls, fruits and vegetables.
No street dogs are seen on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their taste" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of cars parked.
Runners love the crowded places and do not reject the greedy ones.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it leaves for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will leave you for 15 shekels the day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, a quantity exceeding 51 per cent at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will lead you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While parliamentarians and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the compulsory review law, Timorese have already appeared in the country to trade with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, according to which each worker must carry out an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be sufficient to give the language examination, if not also that of Russian history and that of the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
It is an exception to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
This law will not be subject to persons who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and protection of rights
The network of examining centres will be run by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Amistad de los Pueblos, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants may present themselves to the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the Duma Member States and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: What will this really bring about?
What changes will make the knowledge of the language mandatory, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "employment slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated before departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are the immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, throw a "paid journey" into a creepy and close coat, where he and dozens of others like him will be consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, boss!
However, in the meantime many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give to feed the children, not to talk anymore about dressing them, shoes them, and buying them what they need for school.
As they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work on the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the law on language is concerned, the rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand roubles.
However, a fake registration can be made quickly and by only one thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred roubles for cigarettes or tea," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, told journalists.
"Come on, don't be a jerk, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand roubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker 3,000 rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system from corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be purchased, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not pass the test successfully the first time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is rather small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting shots during wedding celebrations where there were fortunately no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which they killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for licensing to carry weapons, from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared in the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organisations of shooters, require that such measures of "no sense rigour" be discontinued.
The percentage of vandalism with registered weapons is minimal, commented at the BBC news service in Russia, criminal counsel Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms registered in internal organs during the six months of 2012 were committed, compared to the total number of 1168 recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, any weapon can be found at low cost in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Higher State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms orders
The first, "arms of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes the stolen weapons of police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are being sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also place their sand granite.
"Now they have proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Large numbers of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explained.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Planning of Public Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to arms", the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons, and 5 per cent corresponds to "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the weapons stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been buying them for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some alfrez, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two shippers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be carried out, they carry out test purchases for illegal arms dealers," the dependent adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who suggested that I be on the "Begovaya" platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "skin" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop manager. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also to be arrived, say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel cuffs through a trustworthy person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not gonna blow it up.
The novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was published.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't everything.
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer cats for hare: everything there is can be proved.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"It gives me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we begin to negotiate," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any personal documents or meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," he asked the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures both those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: the website is generally registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one will lose his weapon and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures both those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, as hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one may be spent from $100 to 900.
According to the NGO Dmitri Kislov "The Right to Weapons", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
You must wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking leaders.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In the last few days, in the United States, a wave of protests has begun against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart Corporation and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and to fall in its early stages.
Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest wages paid by Walmart workers and those in the fast-food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." On that day, in the United States, it co-ordinated the orgy of scraps that captured millions of inhabitants, and sometimes it was accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers from the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's shops, whose products are directed to modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in your stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of manual mountings or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase of wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to 12$ per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1 per cent more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters are satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8 o'clock in the afternoon of Thursday until midnight of the next day and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the Huffington Post left his job "less than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest had been only "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Case free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the objectives were not exactly the great Walmart warehouses (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and that is why there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest job!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble on some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing union activists with wits and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disgusting
The noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place half of the meeting at the McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local democratic politicians, in particular the Jumaane Williams City Council member, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators were supported by other leading New York Democrats, such as the mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support quick food workers to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times newspaper described, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, where they worked tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain isn't that easy"
The theme of increased reality, so popular among those who love modern technologies, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Google conference it demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the scientists of that company, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of your research group's study?
- We dedicate ourselves to personal-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional viewing systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computer science must be freed from our, our physicist, making it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
Very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, you are still looking forward to solving the question of privacy, since you don't always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose, but shorter movements.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet recording the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you have about modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the start of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the currents of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work to be an equivalent of such a device, but that it does not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the transmitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the signal reflected.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't introduced his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that increased reality is the seventh disruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is found gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the finger-yes, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of your fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Has he tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, there is still work to do for many years.
That is what makes work with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens ahead, to the vanguard of art and culture.
In this list of the best are bright figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements come beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguardism of St. Petersburg in the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the smiling inhabitants and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took into his hands an organist and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything other than a little grey provokes aggressiveness and agitation of bad properties.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was displayed.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of unofficial old artists had finished, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not the lyrics.
And all this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to meet me at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Saint Petersburg Bohemian Bohemian.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected I, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognisable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything gets embalmed and tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothing.
Now one follows him by the clothes, facing the outside, but not inside the person.
And perhaps that person should not be given a hand, but spit on his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
We've seen you recently in the role of an urban planner.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but can commercial art be nice at best?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people gathered in packs, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplions.
Now they've all been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they're coming for thousands!
- You'll see the abandoned ones, there's the sex-social sphere.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is gone.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had hung them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is one concept: cultural officer.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right things were otherwise, kings might not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level that properly evaluate these and open the way for them.
Now he's prospering the subjective personal taste.
The same thing is Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is rare.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Lighting up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board start in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little choice.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says Chief Investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in Venus' orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out in the past half century.
Four generations of worms cultivated in orbit did not differ in anything from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the insect breeding in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979 they were sent to the codorniz egg space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of pregnancy.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the Biomedical Problems Institute (IPBM) laboratory at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they did not find support, the chickens gave rounds at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
Polluelles did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chickens to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological miniarch flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats were descended.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot achieve their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional fund.
Similar experiments are not performed for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our little bird flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after one year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonautas Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero floatability, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside her mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the moment of the first bath only two weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary to gravitation, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvis muscles decrease very rapidly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting in the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, this one will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special outfit for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, to a totally inadequate person," predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: Inspection of the system "švarc" has not given with the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application does not.
So says Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) in an interview with Aktualně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, it mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office which has the obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of control at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
It is a parallel control that we started to perform about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised, this follows the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more strict and complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever more stringent rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring about? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely common control of this type could contribute to our continuing efforts in the implementation of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting something right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the invitations to tender, it means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papeleo", that those who want to look for errors in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation governing the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, such as the NKú, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The competences are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level, and in this respect differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can control only federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors there in Germany.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be specified exactly where it is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it didn't, it wouldn't be good for you to work with our office, would it?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Is it in any way apparent its impact?
Given that the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post controls, a certain delay is necessary.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", whereby we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or, rather, is it a misunderstanding for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is probably a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "harden" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
With the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in the area of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision making.
A system of this kind will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the prime minister of the government can not prevent the performance of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we'll do as if nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, legislation is fairly strict as to how it should be done formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer not to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most of the routes are transitable, in some cases caution should be extreme.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented ice and snowboards.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will slightly rise.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
In contrast, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 cm.
In some places visibility was still bad due to fog, according to information from the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
The R6 and the first-class road in the region are now unrestricted.
However, it is recommended that extreme caution be exercised, especially on some bridges whose surface may be iced and rebalded.
In addition, all second and third categories of roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still reservoirs of ice and snow submerged.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice Region and Hradec Kralové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow cover may have been formed on the tracks, reports the Road and Highway Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas in the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ustí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the Krkonoše mountain roads in Orlické hory.
There is a snow cover nestled in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemian area, the sky will be today between clear and partially clouded, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three under zero and one positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although caution must be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be ice cream, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall of temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from the information provided by the Road Operations Control Centre in the region.
Highway D5 is nearly passable without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on the track between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the road area of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be carrying ice plates.
The 2nd and 3rd categories are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less transit routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be partially snowed.
After chemical treatment, it was still snowed in the port of Červenohorské and on the way to Videlský kříž.
The road workers took off the snow during the night; on the Šumper road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most routes are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with a half-dread snow towards Jeseník," confirmed today a operator of the Šumper road administration at the ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also came to the Jesenická colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the tracks in the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road roads are unrestricted, in that of Šternberská drivers should drive carefully on the forest tracks, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
North Bohemian road operators have reported complications in different sections at first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. However, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central mass, there are no problems and roads, usually, are dry.
There have been no service complications for the reminder.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected rain and snow that melts and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month's time, the end of the world is coming, how do you feel about it?
It's just one of many other alarm news we like to catch.
The Tap Tap music group rather likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-of-the-art charity that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the Mayan calendar set out for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on 20 December at 9 p.m., we will hold 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be acquired at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can you hear at the beneficial concerts?
Of course it will, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
They will sing it all at the same time at the three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with even other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
Let us make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money collected be used for the concerts against the end of the world?
A equipment for the school centre without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in the sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ustav.
Students at Jedličkův usetav school regularly receive a visit from teachers with whom they conduct fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to do so possible.
As part of the completion of the works at Jedličkův ustav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and interpreters act in each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "wonderful action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so surely here we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of us in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, boxes with instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came from a short time ago, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it remains unfrequently that a person moves alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that seeks to fear the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on those to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with serious disabilities to move on their own in public and to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will start to change everything really.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophon, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator Laa Angelovič says, he left a little of our hands (Laughter).
However, popularity has not come until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work we do not see is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something could be done otherwise.
The world of show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in his own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I daresay that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and who we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and require certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: There Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever wills and wins will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ustav in Prague, the cost of which amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the forward selling option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of the ESA of the former bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's way to the cosmos began a long time ago.
The Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before the Second World War, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie award and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925, in Poland, a drain was built that would be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the project highlights are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
Information on this area is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
Based on the stored material, it is clear that the investigation came to the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna and rakietomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile engineering projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of Problemy magazine, the first reference is made to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautica Society (PTA) had aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautica (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year Kazimierz Zarankiewicz, PTA first president (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He took this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe MRI (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and launched for the first time on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was built and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket air tests were started in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1,4 meters high and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a height of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the height wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a rocket of two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum height in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first air tests of which began in October 1970.
The meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined in research on cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is at the beginning of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in labour costs (wages) is economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distance and for this purpose "causes a decline" in the price of the competitor with the aim of making itself with most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, to buy there cheaper or to disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, it is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, it necessarily increases the social spending of the state.
All of this leads to the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in their efforts to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thereby attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments place private capital at the disposal of their own people without regard for social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, food delivery points have existed in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people who receive this kind of help is already up to the million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a quite frequent case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest in order to get to the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The measures to save virtually all the states in the south of the EU are undoubtedly leading to the same situation. People, pressured by an abyss of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to maleviate with a pessim wage within society, in the hope that one day they will reach the private capital country.
Do you have to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say to the satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads the economy to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by getting into control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness in the political march and hence throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favor, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, charge the drafting of draft laws to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of legislation is subsequently approved in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with liberal orientation are rapidly in a situation such as the one that describes Appiasmos in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been breaking down and administrations occupied the force."
In exchange for bribes, favours obtained unlawfully and aid to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without hindrance and people went to the polls with the pre-apalled vote"... "there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, due to this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be serious that the only remedy for such a grave situation was self-ocracy and it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianus thought of Pompeii, Caesar went up to power and turned democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today's society is based on dismissive preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in essence, able to understand and claim the benefits of the entire society.
The result is the same as that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, such as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That noting comes from violence and not knowing ever could do anything about violence," Sting in his Fragile song and whose stribillo prays "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (we don't forget what fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his deathbed in 1849.
After the last waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, diverse reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and encases Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and taps Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated on a regular basis and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small land area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in conclusions to which I have come on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who led their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that at this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to reach one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, declared or a war is being waged: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the Iraq attack were 5, after defeating Gadafi only four, but in the meantime Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began during the Secession War to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for triggering the major economic crisis of 1929.
His zeal for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the EDF was created so that no crisis like the year 1907 would be repeated.
So, following the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I of the Bolshevik revolution, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarranted from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (wars to end the zarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare for the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflictive situation following the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they were based on the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to the culprits, and then building a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represent so well the function of the fifth column, which took over the flames and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned earlier laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks occurred in both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much from the rope to which the international bankers had tied him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, in the same way as war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel, the focus was created for a third war.
If the international bankers managed to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now together with the Arab population or, generally, a Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel’s supporters and detractors are divided in a way.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning there was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, like in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where it passes 20 per cent of all world oil (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light is now shown the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will be in accordance with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two front fingers, to add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo Film: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic students held the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the disastrous Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: to throw the shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardised the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats in prison were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which has achieved a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to do so helped a covert story with an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a super-production of science fiction.
Gender-combination
The plan that brought the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie sound true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film, the mood states are combined. We find on the one hand well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of events are shown, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: brought men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been ridiculed, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Bye Small, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which action doesn't take place in Boston City, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "running" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the disappointment and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposter team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to reality: not everything is so elegant here (the scene in which you look at the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search after your track becomes crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value its realization and retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that'll be hard.
As evoking a real history and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which presents a survey of the most absurd banking fees each year, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40% share of women in senior management positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women is one of the preposterous absurdities.
So far, women had better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers for life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition on the use of the expression "untar butter" or the withdrawal of the classic bulb from the trades has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union's apparatus often makes such decisions under pressure from one commercial or industrial lobby whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission argued that it is only seeking to harmonise non- homogenized national rules to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive is a waste of edibles.
The candidate for the survey could be the EU prescription last year that inflatable balloons on the market are mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction is also in force for use by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Fare, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as we entered the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for subsidies.
This kind of idea emerged not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage for having no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation", declared in autumn 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stores and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended to draw up applications for Brussels grants.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often white for criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts, and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to some experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also involved in sensitive fibers, as is the case with other countries in the Union, in the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these fists.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc requisition, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and went on to be called "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected EU designations of origin, together with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the mapapan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found, for example, Karlovy Vary's cookies, the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
As protected EU seas, they may be proud of Pardubice's ginger bread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší's boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a lover, Okamura says
Senator, how did you come to the election for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't apply.
But I can no longer stand to see how it's stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves get unpunished, the taxes and the retirement age are increased.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has arrived, but soon thereafter it has set out for the presidency.
Aren't those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I said that if I was elected as a senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the TV, but we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
To this are added the media, which disparaging and confusing freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists what I have been advising Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
It must change the law for that purpose.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby for the office of guide to be recognized as self-employment, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether on the right or on the left, they are rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without framements or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it considered rather a man on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if anyone's on the right or the left, I want to join people.
Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and likewise I will be against the bad ideas.
He's joking when it's said about you that he's populist.
But you're not proving it by what you're saying?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be people who call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, he is left with no appeal.
And it cannot survive in long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, achieve criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side in order to achieve it.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live TV broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President, who has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as I can for my programme.
I'm trying to get things out of the way myself, but in case it doesn't work out well, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I presented myself starting from the base that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the unbeatable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money for the presidency campaign, but in my transparent account, there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
You talk about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, a flat worth ten million, another floor charged in eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued in one million, and on the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evil and injustice.
Does an Aston Martin drive, its property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be indebted?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor demonstrates that there is no interest in my programme too much.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign's expenses cover essentially what I will receive in terms of senator's salary.
For example, I could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So he'll continue his business to live?
Didn't you say before you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a larger salary.
As promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want him to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How often do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I was president, I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not just in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "besides, the building is nice."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
No one likes to come into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a city bedroom located at the gates of Rotterdam that deserves just a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having climbed up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to somehow contribute to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented in the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was that the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for funny buildings paired with cynics, took the theme with its usual serenity and attended the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury stared around him and shuddered with his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Beloved fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books by Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises at the expected location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townships.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the little town lacking in history, which so far had nothing but to offer a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall after which white facade one would rather intuit a dairy centre, now has a contemporary architectural work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that takes us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography at every step of its climbing to the top.
The interior completely crystallized is bright and easy to cover with the view, the recovered brick floor and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view, you can see park benches, dogs and boys playing football.
And all over books, books and more books.
"The bookshelf stands are usually arranged along the facade, and in the center there is a huge dark room which usually is somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put our feet up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the middle.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of mural, parapet and rail covering at the same time.
The sight, touch, and smell are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers more per day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, in a Frisian farm, we encounter the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of few millimetres thick is used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is cheap and efficient.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was taken, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain four-centimeter thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sport slipper.
After 105 steps you get to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment at the side that keeps air humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it because of its large surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology," Trouborst says.
The required heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden ridges located cross-section to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, the traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, at the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the city's inhabitants were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill up, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone down deep.
The shelves are full.
"There's nothing worse than an empty middle library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection to this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in that queen discipline that in the specialized argot is known as the "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.
Finally a starting point to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany had abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather furthest diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was concerned to establish a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A country-like foreign policy such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy in German terms mean?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation for economic policy, that is, exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give such importance to him because it is not a fully unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has succeeded in gaining some respect.
After all, all this has done is to show that it is a country they take seriously as international actors and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of US domestic policy.
I think the Obama government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position publicly.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the politics he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it has with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a superior entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a serious matter.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always a little awkward and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to have a more important role to play.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time Germany places itself as a major actor, certain anti-German feelings are disbanded.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Given this way, Germany is in a far more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not currently covering this gap, who is left at that time?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant, or if it makes them even more unpopular, it's life!

"Marks protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly turn into Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with original companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the real eponyms do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case comes to my table.
The copyists simply add a couple of letters to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive where it keeps seats in the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company asked to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are world champions in the matter of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsifications.
However, Pattloch's cases are of another kind. On behalf of its clients, he fights the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears, and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millions, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of €15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury items and the one growing at the most.
However, the cancellation of dubious legality registrations in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also requires a lot of money.
Processes can be extended for up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long since the name that was the subject of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the complainant is in bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarizer because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch says.
This is sometimes the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the Sany construction machinery manufacturer, the company that was recently absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why today Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to Mercedes's star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that reminded BMW to a large extent; the matter was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copymakers from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China will lead for the tenth consecutive year the list of new inscriptions around the world, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which totals 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been charged in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has fought in court against a Chinese impersonator.
Although the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the copymaker has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the names are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office also dismissed the use of the Munichns.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been justified, but the opposite side continues to fight at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now arrived at the doors of the High Court of Justice, where resolution is still pending.
Wentzler trusts that he can resolve the issue favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "sum of six euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but failed.
"This shows how much we care," said Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if copyholders are guaranteed there rights on unprotected brands.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this business area, but has been able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights legislation, but that what needs to be done is "to register also in China anything that might be capable of protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic may be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would kick us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg tries the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans are happy
The history of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometres away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers begin to rise slowly (collateral, low, tenor and soprano), shivering, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his cages by trying to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of Heidelberg's Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir tries a new song.
Fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every choir voice has a different text and in addition in a foreign language hardly known: zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS, around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Association Voices for Africa has found patrons in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month a child can be taught.
This contribution will cover school registration, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "story narrator" or "panegrist".
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but sing they do know.
For ten years this choir has been practicing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8.733 kilometers away online straight from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud huts and straw, a large part of them are children.
Over 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, says Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying over thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this populous population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally occupied AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the TBS of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sardines are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected individuals?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given in men who have sexual intercourse with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are reported in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has continued to decline since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide protection to one hundred per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the honoraries that the choir collects for its actions throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"We have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni in total," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the town of Zodwa Dlamini a woman with self-confidence and leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as the older women in zulu are called, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where they live and take care that the children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the people tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the evidentness of this disease throughout the country, it is not common to speak openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent, overcrowded lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This form of life that has not been officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But it is also because of the countless temporary people who travel the country from one side to the next and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact with skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years to the south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many on the southernmost end of the African continent still remember the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites that sing songs in a black language; so much recognition brings not only excellent atmosphere and much joy, but has also managed to rip out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the paedrined children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River Valley is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," the local people say.
And after traveling the 8.733 kilometers online straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the pass, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 metres.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the planet closest to the sun, there is also iced water, as it appears from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow an ice layer has been formed.
It looks like it's at least 30 centimeters and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably made from comets or, with great probability, asteroids that in their day were struck against Mercury.
No one connects the ice finding with the possibility of life on the planet, says Chief Investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other life components have come to other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertent to the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the planet dwarf Ceres.
Like Pluto, which rotates around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "new born" stars.
This region of star formation, called unromantically by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This torn image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material the star spits into its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture from the Galactic Star Formation Zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible simply in view of the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrareds.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarium.
His similarity with an Earth continent has served him the name of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This sky star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and his rings: how they originated remains one of the great incognites of astronomy.
It's probably remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without leaving a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and most sharp photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxia del Remolino.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this area of star formation into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion humbling one to the other in order to end up collapsing irreparably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the constellation Cefeo.
The 1,400 light-year-old nebula consists of particles of dust that are between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of particles of dust that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the greatest sized spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula you will find the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also continuously new stars; at 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe one could find above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images that they offer us have become more and more profound.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous capacity to gather light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope is 305 meters in diameter.
In the "External Intelligence Search" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honours its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explore the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope with huge proportions and a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hands of the Hubble Space Telescope.
From 24 April 1990 he sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 candidates for planets had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the base that on the southern pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no credible evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first one orbiting Mercury, scientists are now sure that it is.
Drink butter every day and live 168 years

To the south of Azerbaijan, many people are reaching Bible ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for fingerprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves through the windy road passing by forested hills, large-flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of whom you don't know much, apart from who perfectly dominate the Persian and Azerbaijani and who are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city boasts an architecture perhaps too solid designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban centres, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to Caspian oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
He is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have passed the 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
Your son died at the age of 136.
However, the museum's undisputed star is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we note that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter over the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the old age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very older people living," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many older people?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum's director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in calories of the talyshi, who adore meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, moreover, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, he is relatively young for what is stretched out by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wooden house throughout the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, it moves a huge butter bowl unhesitatingly.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in a typical glass with an abombed shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the cloth hides two long braids of dark red hair that her son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept her color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been to buy a supermarket in my entire life.
Then tell us about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, everything came back to its tail when the "Dear Father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes itself to the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
This remained in power until 2003, when the witness gave in to his son Ilham.
At least older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for monthly pension, a amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The expression "Human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Protests that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is submerged.
The future constitution, with sharia as a base, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not escape in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and secular ones.
All of them, unresolved so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost pleading for forgiveness, he had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been enforced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean about "princes"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and Islamists seem to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre it has shown, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression over the opposition.
After the dictator's fall up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft establishes, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly sets out equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offense to people"
Is it enough a caricature of the president or a joke about a legal person?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to break the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be “in the trash bin of history”.
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "state strike against democracy".
"When the referendum is convened, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been at stake," was quoted in the Egyptian media to the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-promantation; for whatever reason, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it in the cry of "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi to "clean the country", at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this regard, it seems that the draft of Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because to him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to be resigned.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolishing it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protester on Tahrir Square warns: "You are designing a monster you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most evil fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success is related to its greed for a highly malolent fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothing.
Leave it there for a week.
It will then smell the paralysing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisiteties.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is a salad trout that is left to ferment in water during, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this food most, so to speak, captivater.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of a tank aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
We see people everywhere eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking a great amount of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Harvard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different to a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and, before cooling existed, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is released and, evidently with inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not far richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered an important part, an essential part, although rather malolient, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the friolera of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to shooting as "the event of 22 July."
Norwegians find it extremely difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Following much of Norway's present wealth is the growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde melane and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone wasted money that he had not had during the years before the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a shelled development.
I'm on the snow tailing to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is no doubt something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he returns that evil fish.
The hotel where I am staying is one of the many venues where a rakfisk dinner is celebrated where the diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A TV has been connected live with a presenter wearing a bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps vanquished by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyses the challenges facing the new President and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at the moment.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday, which cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation's management.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before falling into contact with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism in place and of the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive through one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the steep and muddy roads that were rehabilitated.
Plates with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, with regard to security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic stateman and, above all, he's a person who can listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Peña Nieto say, at best, that he could not address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuse your administration of making the view fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that her husband murdered her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed as if her body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross in which one single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old joke, a bully, a chink.
What they want is for one to just accept what they say and to shut up."
"But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president that it was when I was governor," says PRI's MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors are trying to address Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during their prison stay
The trial focuses on the Manning period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed based on the fact that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest filtering of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted at Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following a request from the defence to dismiss the case as its imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already been sufficiently punished, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the Friday view, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers completed after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held in maximum prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning and noted his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the cellers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of those problems and indicated that they would be concerned, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'without incident' (after having talked about problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the intentions of suicide that he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was present.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is below the level of possible suicide surveillance, to ensure their protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the major state to know that I was well and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Arafjon Camp, that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a claws, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even fall during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from the outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the janitors couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on treatment received by Manning.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday declaration that, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to remain naked in front of the cinders and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given by the cellor that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that they had forced him to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his heels to self-injurious but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their underwear, shawls, and glasses from their cells.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he had experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted on the war council, which is scheduled to start early next year.
The defence stated that it intends to have Manning convicted of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered to be too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detained person who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally triggering the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down by the explanation and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the path to two queues: one for "Mexico" and one for "Extrangers".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
As I grew up in Central California, all my life they called me Mexican.
This is about ethnic tachography, the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York are called "Italian" themselves.
Later I decided for "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, the taquigraphy or the scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and got into the queue of foreigners.
I thought at that time this week when Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and to create in North America a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in to half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for the Mexicans, who think for centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, at a time when a U.S. official says anything that leads to Mexico's worst criticism, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and in the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Motezuma stand for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one that has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Shall we speak of resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for those who are not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that somewhere in our family tree there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, who closed the door to opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty does.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his way of seeing us, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this dew between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know with more solidity who they are and in seconds this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered to be part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either of them.
We love to hear from the Los Tigers group in the North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora again.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, friends.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their family was treated a lot less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicomen" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, the majority of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything to be done, whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional hub.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly dead-point situation could be disqualified.
A War That Never Fails or Wins
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire on 21 November is held off, this week's clashes have strengthened the falcons of both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most wretched and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to stop Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its relentless Fatah rivals, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the Muslim ally closest to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. It has also done so, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The exhilarating members of Hamas say that the half moon Islamist is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulah militia dominates through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, Muslim Brothers are Hamas' cousins and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as the protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the contrary conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
The Israel Iron Summit missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier corrode to the West Bank, the main part of a territory that aspires to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that under international law they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Licusud has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period prior to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pamper those Palestinian twisted people by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not shoot rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and hit them good if they lift their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, even though the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire off is a good augur and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions to Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution continues to be the one that asks sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
Hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to arms entry into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside of the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote your attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green black, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on generic tobacco and packaging, pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of an olive green blackout, frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
Except for the different health images and warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of source.
This is the most stringent regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
She trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that China and Indonesia counterfeiters will bring to sell on Australia's streets.
Others say that their business has benefited following the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the demand for silicone blankets to cover the unpleasant images of the crates had been fired almost two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law at the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"For us it's a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be," Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University said.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands from "footmen" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One can ask whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what implies new legislation than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to decline the new rules; these countries are affirming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to deliver a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar legislation on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India harsher laws are being implemented.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"The pictures don't affect me.
I simply don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Surely, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, the manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that the uniform boxes make it more complicated to put them on the shelves.
"It would normally take an hour to unload a delivery; now it would take four," says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it is, okay, it's over and we're closing the store," he says as he lifts his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we flew on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have ways to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development who praise the kindnesss of boredom.
According to them, it is good that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that boredom brings.
So, should we gladly accept boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom that dates back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but not being able to, participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he states, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boring can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider it their problem.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the room a full-volume television program that did not keep any relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of care can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doing garabats, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, as it makes that person physically more alert."
"The research shows that those children allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes questions like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, states that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But generally, adolescents are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
She found out that 32 percent of teenagers said she was bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said she was bored when she was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they'd get bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he knew was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest rating," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my question from the beginning, is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you see television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long run.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer get bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to enjoy himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something worth the trouble," he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and football institute in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences each involving a fine of US$100) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor cases due to drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes due to marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
The police departments have ceased to file charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with the open cases for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently authorized marijuana stores in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licenses; all of this before the deadline arrives, on 1 December 2013.
They say that for good or for bad, Colorado goes in front of most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model," he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
Furthermore, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as the way of maintaining a balance between the state's requirement to provide "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or child playgrounds.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the police chief of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to bring legal proceedings for minor marijuana possession offences to persons over the age of 21 and that the police would cease to hold charges against these crimes “with immediate effect”.
Chief of Police Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing city regulations regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people are faced with positions of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other positions.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those crimes that occurred at the time they were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, prosecutor of the county district, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that emerge across the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Law Reform of marijuana.
"It's been so long taking people to court that they can't really accept it to be legal," he said.
Being the first states that consider small quantities of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become a test case at the national level in relation to drug law-making.
While state lawyers and officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still envisages considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give up.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has largely allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to pull doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably show reluctance to allow state-regulated stores to operate for recreational use of marijuana, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an oversulsor of anti-drug policy of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against to vote in favour of what the state voted."
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt, "They harassed me until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory."
You don't attack college students by their views just now
I don't remember any moment in my life in which I haven't been dreaming about getting a seat at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of occupying my position at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history career, I had already packed my bags, triggering the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had left because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had left because they forced me to drink in unscathed cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
They harassed me for only one reason, which in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they wonder what that comes to right now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students is undergoing similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of students of degree) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously absent, personally attacked and treated as ungraceable people" because of their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and Right) on student policy and presenting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by introducing higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice-president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
The 21-year-old Samuel Roberts and a history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection states that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of the JCR members to the people who are of the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, and I was an extremely shy 18 - year - old.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a "honoris cause" title after cuts in higher education funding.
The environment would have made any Stalinist startle with horror.
Already during the first few days of the welcome week to the new university students, when the new students met and met the cathedralians, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I discovered that not only did the cathedrats look at the mocking of conservative university students, but they gladly participated in it.
The policy of the mine workers' strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the seminar's wooden rooms.
The first to attend was to translate into English 18th-century French texts and I was not prepared for what I came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a bald man with a face that looked like a bizcoto mass, knew well how to expel bad biles.
"Is thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grumbled.
I went back to my room as a soul in grief.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it's going to be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appeared to be Labourists."
Later, in a local pub, I tried to hide myself.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"You kick each other, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me just after nightfall?
Should I work and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's adviser in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just over there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents in London, finding refuge in my relatives and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar at which another professor of History had insinuated, talking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted little time.
It was my father who put the last key in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
By that time my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was surrounded by fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they were packed, I picked up the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only trained 14 Conservative prime ministers but, to this day, is hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designers clients
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of the Coustura", a retrospective apotheotic that gathers more than 130 high seam dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but it could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the distant and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, there are plenty of private letters and pictures with the signature of the most aristocracy grenade, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: of humble fashion in the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off the hills of their beaks on your magnificent carpet as do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintenance with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmuner of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, polishing a Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on her floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Coustura Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he ends.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well - matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that shines on Valentine's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume he used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this public of Mannequins names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, for he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and they are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion writer Patricia della Giompaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of reaching age and opportunity to wear one of her evening suits...
The time finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's Dress to wear at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, "corsage" flagged and escort word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg guards her fashion party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that comes with it."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's bride costume at her wedding with Pablo from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlfriends" (as the fashionist calls their seamstresses) to make that ivory silk costume with pearl inlays, twelve different lace types and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of customers from the high society".
Overwhelmed for years with the "know-being" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as much honor as any of its clients' spouses.
"It has always brought attention to its refinement, its calmness, its clean and perfect look," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
And a princess says it...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by blowing up the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the interiors of the Earth solidifies when you come into contact with the air.
After plucking large sulphur rocks, which total up to about 70 kilos, it carries them into two bamboo baskets carrying on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb by step of tortoise, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall by the precipice.
They know that any sweat can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off for years because of the risks of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for each pound of sulphur they extract
Once upstairs, the tourists photograph them as circus monkeys and, carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture cerillas, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is carrying 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends soft, but allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the field.
"The mining newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (€1.2) the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", the carrier, who used to work as a handkerchief on the tourist island of Bali, clarifies.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the stem was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as overwhelming as the sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and getting irritated by toxic gases
At 27 years of age, Anto has been playing the leather in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
She has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden hut with other carriers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to rule at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Declaring the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater clobbering with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its slight benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and thus the weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of cargo per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this nature park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for animals and not for people," said Madrusin, a trained 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and listens to the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains about suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sore throats on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on your back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which three trucks move to the warehouse of Tamasari, 18 kilometers away along a path of goats between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, he also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's hardest trades: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem inconceivable that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "We're going to put a bowl (ball) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, harbors the hope that with the ad they can draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty."
This is something purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a matter that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing evenings of quick quotes (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So let's think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
What's not taken so lightly is Singapore's government.
It costs US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently found to be 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as a replacement rate - it was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporens have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in singleness, and a delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, a policy of immigration is aimed at dramatically increasing immigration in order to cope with the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia is abundant barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are critical of keeping low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to address the problem, with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square metres of surface area and have been very successful in selling.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life-style of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously impeded if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules can be a step towards an increase in the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive and education is also expensive, so many people are putting it off," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off-line is private on-line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private life or "the field of private life that is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a under 16?
How does this definition apply in your everyday life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed to ventilating on the Internet situations that you probably wouldn't share offline?
The Newspaper interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", at the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when applying it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not raise them to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been counting for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked persons, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened up Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just raise them," he says.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone who recommended a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demand me simply the sacks of my account," he admits.
Joseph became Ask's follower, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I never knew who I was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"I only gave him privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would take pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would, if I fell ill, or I'd like to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to look for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, used these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we're still learning," he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not spread, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when they care most about being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to label them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"An outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it must be in social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Student Guardia, university professor, primary professor and educational consultant, notes that it is essential for parents of families to read the policies of social networks to their conscience.
In understanding each of the indents they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not speak with strangers".
Finalizes Unasur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
Today, the 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded in Peru without publicizing the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Ephe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Affairs and Presidency noted at a beginning that it would be delivered after the closure, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website at some time.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only, in the press room, the video without the sound of the presidential assembly was broadcast with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The limited information circulated among the reporters was provided by the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, even though it was not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which resulted in the plight of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the statement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of the Americas of the Arab South Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite its persistent demand for the press, the so-called Lima Declaration which they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the ASPA official website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international citations, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that there were secured transmission systems for all journalists but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Hague Court that would express a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the IJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima submitted against Santiago.
"We will reach and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, next to his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country of respect for international law, for the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a hand-cuff, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, following a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inaccuracies of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the afternoon of Lima.
The representative read out the outcome document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and set out the lines of action for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will give "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements."
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-price internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional appointment he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We're going to review all these paths, they're not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the take-over of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Block Defense Ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-temperity presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country."
He defended, in that regard, the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers from any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything, and instead we South Americans signed everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said Ecuador's founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, in reference to political asylum.
Correa assured her that she was not sorry about that decision because it did not betray her principles, but has respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding questioning on his territory for a alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation allows it to be carried out by videoconferencing, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk of deterioration in Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little lung problem, nothing serious," Ecuadorian representative said.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being confined in a small space without being able to perform outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a lifeboat to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use it in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is doing a number of procedures at different European levels," he said.
And he thought, "If Britain gives tomorrow the safe-run this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits, and as it has in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm herself as a press freedom defender and said that what she does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lie, which distorts freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but evil journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer "not the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and went on to be re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and couppism clothed with legality" because in reality "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not recognized.
It's a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute held in the same court in Peru and Chile and felt that "it is right for Latin America to seek international forums if both countries undertake to accept hard judgement."
Referring to the possibility presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa assured that if it loses the February 2013 elections, it will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed that probable victory, for we have to accept that responsiveness," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that he was expected to spend the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," he refers to remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more soft," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG head of the HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affect to the immune system that patients present at the start of diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who are diagnosed with positive HIV at the age of 25 years, under these terms, "while maintaining control can live without problems up to 75 years," the interviewee explained.
To dimension this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the AIDS outbreak, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medication, the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their condition, i.e., in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already present opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make early diagnoses and therefore they have to offer evidence of detection in a massive way, to all people who need it."
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to test a particular laboratory, only motivated by a friend and, despite his short age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die already, I'd better come back three times a week," they say no to me.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medication.
To date, her parents only know she suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but corresponding, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, your message, sums up the AIDS battle motto this 2012.
Conduits after dial
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, supported Ricardo Salazar, a Tatato journalist who has assumed the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packs of one hundred, and that is very good but it turns out there are those who still have no access to a condom today," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with a smile and valuable judgements from social workers, school principals, drug workers and health personnel, to whom teenagers are not willing to be exposed, said the communicator.
I proposed reorientating this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the display boxes and that one hundred are in public bathers in the places where young people attend.
It's not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying them the shawls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded, asking him if he would share condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Claves In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases accumulated (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the blood route, and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for a recorded case.
Ratified by a U.S. Court of Appeals a judgment that ignores the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade contest in Mexico, the scenario puts an adverse precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country having solvency problems.
Thus, it would be said that the downstream procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, against international conventions.
In the practical field, the spanish to the judgment issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless to Mexican firms against the possibility of an embargo of their properties throughout the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the trade contest conducted in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational corporations.
In fact, to that end the United Nations Model Law on Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, and the American Law Institute was appointed an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompanies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts that Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring had not been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexican, whose intercompanies debts endorsed the Federal Institute of Merchantile Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that, by remaining the vows of the subsidiaries, in any case, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The facts are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, this blames Vitro on the difficult situation that he faced since 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, beating the collection to the country.
As soon as possible, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals for the vote to be filled by the Assembly, namely the five judges, since they only voted three.
If this does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare, which requires a review of the proceedings by a higher court, will be sought in this case by the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The gravity of the case is that the court filed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("court friend"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Merchants Competitions Act, noting that it was released with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it to chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
General Balance

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes basketball trotamunds was more than 60 years attached to board sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it's just that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, he was as a minor player, a player of the National Superior Basketball, mastered and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vacheros or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reies recalled during a First Time visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, thus testifying to him.
Bahamon in the Heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who recall their passage through the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he served 15 years as co-powered or possessed of the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight Vakero championships since 1967, already as the owner, co-power or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I laid off one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on he took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong 6"7" player.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's principle, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was native and one of our best shooters.
I remember you said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would have helped bring another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at the distance, because by 1988 it was already made up of federative mandamas.
For that time I preferred to enjoy their executions and Mincy's on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the U.S. during the Preolympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth place and must have been bronzed from being not by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that group in the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've seen?
It's among the best, like the one who won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we gave a ball to the United States team, which was quite similar to the bronze we won in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Preolimical in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the Panamericano de Mar del Plata line, we won gold against all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculín did.
And that doesn't count his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the NSB had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things that I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island on national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my age on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role she liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was submitted to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well-received papers from criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led to Hagman at his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risky in gambling houses.
It also helped to give the series an audience record at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and converted to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s brother-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with being a prostitute unless she was out of town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried that his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Principal Victoria, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "great, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, who had the luck of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
Five of the chapters had already been recorded for the second season and one sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
There was no immediate pronouncement by Warner or TNT about how the Hagman loss will handle the series.
Oriondo de Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stared classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He proved lucky in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in some way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I gather with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like, "no friend, it'll be a little awkward for a little while, but they'll be fine."
He was also an activist against the smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
They begin course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the May Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been held as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what he was expecting in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists at the end of the times believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," said Charmé this week to the students of Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is taking the course "Medium, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could trigger a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare them to real life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made teams to teach a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "coming ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night that the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who were wondering if there was still place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no interviewee - and much less a teacher - said he believed in the date of expiry of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, 21 and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he pointed out that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, when people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the day lightly.
They said they're going to "the end of the world" parties.
"Perhaps I'll call some friends for us to laugh together," said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
