Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "marione"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, that is to say, they are called MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This issue was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Galicia Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he “comes with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "faecal materials".
A member of the Galician Country Party of the National Assembly of Wales stated that, overall, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party claimed that the group has a "open" attitude to the change of name, but that it has also observed that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the word "w" is pronounced in Wales as in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce the name change, said: “The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend even on those members.”
The 2017 Law on the Government of Wales offered the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that many of them wish to use the 'Galli Country Parliament'.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred ‘members of the Parliament of Wales’ or ‘WMP’, but the option ‘MWP’ received the most votes during the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones the leadership committee president, who is expected to send the draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the functioning of the meeting, including the rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the country's name change
On this Sunday, citizens with voting rights will express their views on the change of their country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite's vehement opponent of the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is only a compromise that will enable them to join the EU and NATO.
The church bells of St. Martin stopped beating as a result of the problems the churches in Harlem faced
"From a historical point of view, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that you had previously found a bar and a church in every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no more bars and churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather."
And as far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expected and that, “before or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “this will therefore speed up the closure of churches, because it is unlikely that many people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became an African-American metropolis – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African - American people, who are doing their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for the Harlem shopping, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's huges made plans to rebuild it and included the carilon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, called the chinalon "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who put the carilone into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "a historic instrument to be replaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, has also stated that it was the first carilon in the world performed by an African-American musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed to a higher carilone, at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in the last few months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing entity of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese “will seek to pass the costs” to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the Enoriasts complained about the lack of transparency that demonstrated the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old kid who was trying to catch lobsters in California.
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7am, near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour with his friends on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that, initially, he thought the boy was delighted that he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "It bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water, “It’s a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer is planning to strengthen its position on the UK commodity and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available districts with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom, of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not able to do so, larger districts with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several shops in the following year if they prove to be successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context that supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury Retailer representatives said that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, an increasingly popular demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing, the first being the open one last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets have to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury Relayer, said that the outlets will increasingly appear as universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight with large stores with discounts, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of shops, as well as Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profit.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ended after a divergence on how Boots store revenues were shared into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, from Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury brands to care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury Retalier, said: “I have transformed our rayon appearance with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations transform us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
The protagonist of the TV show Dragons' Den, Peter Jones, is furious after TV show Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his life-style company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes household accessories and household objects.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltraw.
The presentation of the 37-year-old "This Morning" show announced to Instagram that it would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the "Dragons‘ Den" show, retreating at the last moment in their business that offers life-style services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones became angry when one of the most fond people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, no longer allow him to dededicate their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household objects.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's wealth, with an estimated 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, a 37-year-old, announced on Instagram that he would quit the Truly contract, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It had to be her long-term future, for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, there was a little till launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presentation of the "This Morning" issue, which is among the best-selling stars in Britain, could bring millions of damage to the company, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible additional delay in the launch.
It may also represent the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand base together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host to the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider “reliance from a president” and that he has such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a big step back?
Trump said by mimicking a voice of "newsman" .
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world's leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "appropriate response" from the United States to the previous disarmament moves of North Korea.
On the other hand, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," he said.
"The goal is to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, the support offered for the release of hostages and the return of the U.S. soldiers.
She also defended the unusual way to talk about her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I behave like this, instead of the 10,000 outsiders, who try to enter this incapacitating arena, it would be about 200 people," Trump said, showing to the crowd who are in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok Island population has been dislocated, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary condition for triggering aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been very clear that I do not ask for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Subung said.
Although the "Save Children" Foundation tries to form a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
Considering the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia consistently, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be insufficient for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh , they are not often found on other coasts .
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the event of a tsunami in Palu, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the trip between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this even more complicated.
A hospital ship that stayed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that the improvement of the precare infrastructure in Indonesia be the focal point of his electoral campaign and has allocated money for roads and railways with a keen interest.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration, which will participate next year in a new election campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressures from the Indonesian sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using pots, arches and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the rescue goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League in front of Chelsea team, with a goal in the minute 89, Saturday, at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a step from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it was about 30 meters from the opposite team gate, and his team was led by Chelsea at 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball got over the ball, heading towards the corner at the top of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed through Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to it and fell into the gate.
"I just had to try to get in the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took the ball away."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then returned to the middle of the field and ran to the middle of the field of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he sent Hazard's ball, which came in.
Hazard went over the defense and sent the ball to the net, managed to hit her with his left leg and get past the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the team Naples in the phase of the leagues of the Championships on Wednesday, at 15:00, on São Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday, 15:00, London.
Number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency in the morning of Sunday.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 metres, said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected that he killed a woman by stabbing.
A crime investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m., with wounds caused by stabbing, at Grayson Mews, on John Street, and was arrested a man suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something about this subject to come to the section for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stage, but I appeal to all people near John Street in Birkenhead who have heard or seen something suspicious to contact us.
I also wish to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the camera on board to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, some people came to the crime scene who think they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are in progress, and the police said they're trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to go back to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told that it would take several hours until they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the whole area is now considered the crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
Repeatedly "it's so terrible!".
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and one more was outside it.
A few police officers sat in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person who has information is asked to send a direct message to the police @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at telephone number 0800 555 111 and refer to case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the altercations on "rewriting history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban style of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, performed by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of states as Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclastism of the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas's actions of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the nineteenth century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many think deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual figure, which is part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media agencies.
The man, identified only after the name "Yuan", was found dead after he was removed from the artery and covered with blood, near a pig farm located in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
It seems he had come with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring elbow was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's children were filled with blood and broken," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m., to feed their pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else while the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious harm to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive in a normal way, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
"It's just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rain in the southwestern United States
As expected, the Rosa hurricane loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a hurricane of category 1 on Sunday, from 5 morning and was located about 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive on Sunday in the north.
Meanwhile, it began to form a depressive area across the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed zone will generate abundant rain in the south-west the next few days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause hazardous rapid floods, waste streams and possible desert landslides.
Intensive tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm in the south-vesque part shall be expected, in particular in the majority of Arizona.
Rapid floods may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture in the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could lead to the transformation of the Canaanites into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds in gusts and dust.
The adjacent depressive zone will bring torrential rains to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
These will be the first precipitation in the region, in the wet season.
Tropical rains scattered will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and the first part of the month, before the rain spreads more months evening and Tuesday.
Intensive precipitation will spread in so-called “four corners” Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense changes in temperature in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered in the central area of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and extend again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern part of the United States will be confronted with a warm start of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain portions of the north-east.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high chance of over-average temperatures for the east of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a final news: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the panel that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it's 100% certain that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average screening on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems contorting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose host of opinion strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of viewers of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was pursued by 3.1 million people, NBC of 2.94 million, MSNBC of 2.89 million, and CNN of 2.52 million.
The interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS chambers on Friday morning while protestors shouted at it and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were fighting him, and everything was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later lived the vote in the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the vote by the Senate.
But Flake said he'd do this only if the FBI would agree to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority democrats are asking for.
Flake was largely convinced of talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's choice was an important one, obviously the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Great Britain and undermine national interests in a Sunday Times interview.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to his accompanying photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims' shot: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected he shot dead LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with crime by grade 2, according to Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities published the filming of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he recognized that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
Baton Rouge's Office of Legal Medicine published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department pays for the Louisiana police force, the State police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for the assistance offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
The athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligence and quest for justice".
Sims was 20.
The 1.98 m tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU, Will Wade, said the team was “disaggregated” and “suffered” by Wayde’s death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a pillar of ash over Mexico City
The ashes from the volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater was triggered and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors more storms and vibrations.
The images on socializing networks presented thin ash layers on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in the volcanic activity that is 72 km south-east of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Charge between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters fought with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from the gendarmes bombed them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The charge intensified later, the police using their rods to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups have scanned "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while union protestors have called "Long live Spain!"
14 people received medical care for minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen to become independent in a vast majority, although voting was low, and against the secession they largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voting at polling stations in the region, with violent fights taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped by night Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has hopes for the acquisition of independence by Catalonia.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, but gathered, in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to keep up this year, many of the most well-known leaders found themselves either in exile or in detention, awaiting trial for the role played in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered his protest phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after they drove into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 19:30, in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and even to the building.
Turns out at some point, there was an anti-machine handgun used.
Menga's hit helped Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrepeated, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Iberox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be unbeatable in division until six matches, Holt's main coach still feeling the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the cruel visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead long before he signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and attempted to kick through the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after he entered through the slide to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The gasses were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make visitors' problems at the free shots.
And that was the way the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston succeeded in an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who listened and scored from the center of his who.
At that stage, Rangers had mastered possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and Liam Kelly was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow hit a big shot from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to come where the Livingston team, but without success, and the two criminal requests - after Halkett brutched Glenn Middleton and after a belt - were not accepted.
Phenomenal game offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending path.
Their style of play and team have not changed at all since the return to the top, but the merits must be granted to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the entire party.
But Rangers weren't very inspired.
Although they had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they did not reach the same standards.
The empty paces were missed, managed once to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Köln
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to correct relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police have invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but they have gathered quite many supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, the majority of Kurds, made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to receive him with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero of some of the German Turks and an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after a crash with a car
A biker died after a crash with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of town, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the crash site, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place only a few months after another biker died from an accident on Childers Street, where the driver ran from the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The access is restricted in that area, the route of the buses is diverted, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after a fight
Six prison officers were injured following a fight at a high-security prison for men, said a prison representative.
On Sunday, a struggle began at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30, which is under way.
Specialized officers were brought to deal with the fight, involving eight detainees, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the front.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of prison specialist personnel has been requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules on those responsible who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the officers dealing with disturbances, were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the hurricane Rosa (the dry areas can enjoy the benefits as a result of this)
A tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-vestish desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct path to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of the month will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a Twitter message that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained a state of storm or tropical depression about 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km away from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with total possible quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas will be recorded.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in certain areas the torrential rain will be beneficial as the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is facing at least one severe drought, the second largest category, which is the information found onweather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will cause landslides in Mexico, with tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
“Torennial rains between 8 and 10 cm are expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm,” according toweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north to Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday.
"The primary danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, northwestern Sonoria and the desert of the southwestern United States," said a representative of the National Center for Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will cause sudden flooding, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams to the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Middle Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with wounds caused by stabbing in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday, about 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to the police at Avon and Somerset.
Officers asked for the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phone or to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh was confronted with the Democratic Party's "enjoyment and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "enjoyment and anger" during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress, denying vehemently Christine Blasey Ford's claims about having harassed her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage on that day.
"A confirmation vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best lies in the legal field of this generation," he told the many supporters of West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of republican presence in intermediate elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express my overall positive view of candidates whom I consider to be excellent."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place at the latest on Friday, a assistant of the GOP leadership for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on Friday on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at noon, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB disaster relief agency at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami brought cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled wide at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to go up to trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs published by the disaster agency feature several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the relics continued to shake the city on the coast.
The earthquake show was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (PPPT) said that the energy emitted by the strong earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the Atomic Bomb from Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, has probably intensified the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Victims' bodies were found trapped under the cracks of collapsed buildings, said this, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damages could be greater along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were “completely disturbed, without any information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would strike Palu, although the authorities said the waves were reached at the time of the warning.
In social networking posts, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard calling frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated persons still need food and other basic things.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala reached safety in Palu city, where employees are taken to improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed devastating scenes, said Doseba.
He added, "They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses."
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups have begun to launch aid actions in the event of disaster, some people have complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, the delivery of materials and personnel may reach the place of production of a disaster only if it is declared a zone of national disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia, said.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Palu, friends and families of the missing were hoping that loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who had been in ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people from the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after news of the crash of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of sports practitioners with paragliding, he sent desperate messages to WhatsApp competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there was only one gray nozzle, and not two blue nozzles.
“I think that means the messages have not been transmitted,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM from Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from an employee Brink who feeds an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “scured through the back of the employee Brink” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the statement, the witnesses observed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity shall be requested to contact the Newport police at telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in "Ye"
The Rapper Kanye West changes his name as a stage in "Ye".
He made Saturday's announcement about Twitter change: "the person officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance at Saturnday Night Live, where he expects to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes on show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the broadcast manufacturer for ‘emotional reasons’.
In addition to being a abbreviation for the current name of the scene, West stated earlier that this word has a religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most frequently found word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said at the beginning of this year, in the discussion of the title of the Big Boy radio album.
"So it's you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and reached "Ye", being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and on the whole.
The album is more a reflection on what we are as people."
He's one of many rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And an ex-worker of West, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes with crumbs, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
Mexico's President promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, with the approach of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
The troops fired a peaceful demonstration from the market on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-hand movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on field research, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though in the US there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first in the area of innovation AI by 2030.
“Dubling the research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA discovery,” Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be done in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "IA superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, being the best in the field at the time, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Defence Research Agency, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Chinese does not put academic leaders on wheels, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could help the US to step up its efforts to AI.
“I think doctoral visas should be offered automatically in IA,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generations of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organisations provides money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence in the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in order to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of an artificial intelligence selection committee.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
Also at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes in United States legislation aimed at creating a National Intelligence Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote on the referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to the presence of the vote, as it might not reach a minimum limit of 50%, necessary for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the ballot to the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, state that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the fall of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds round is required in parliament.
The state electoral commission said that there were no irregular reports by 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voting persons were put to the vote.
"I came to the vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, as well as their son Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of the name of Macedonia, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small-scale stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with their foreheads, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want the name Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO will bring the much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think most of them will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance at the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-vestian government policy since the government took over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire Brighton team defense and mark a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defensive and obtained Saturday's victory of the Manchester City team with 2-0 on the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero was incredibly easy to mark in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker took a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defense players from Brighton before he got to the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to get past one defender, and then he overstepped several real players on the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he stepped left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, and managed to avoid the doorman at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a kick to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces some problems at his feet," reporters Pep Guardiola, manager of the Manchester City team, told them.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he signed up for a goal at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azurians in the Premier League match.
The goul came in the minute 29.
Aguero got a deep step on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he took a peek at Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the balloon a few times until he sent Sterling a pass, which sent her towards the gate.
The Azurian attacker hit the balloon to the net just before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will meet at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday with Hoffenheim in the group phase, on Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to do the ravages in the game against Rockies
With the national team removed from the play-off competition, there were not many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still play-off implications for Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 victory against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, next to the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer first hit in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening blow of the game with number 34, had a heating session Thursday and will throw in normal conditions on this Sunday.
The Washington midloop has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 beats in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation concerning the taking of a decision by the Supreme Court with regard to Brett Kavanaugh while he was talking about the importance of republican presence in intermediate elections.
"All our effort is at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, not running, but actually running, that's why I try hard to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that they want to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he also said, describing Democrats as "violent and evil, naughty and liars."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which was heavily fled by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different perspective.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised at the fact that activists Momentum from my local party supported the motion of censure as far as I'm concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who has been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement in terms of anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censure was a critic at my address for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, concerning which neither Jeremy had a common opinion with previous leaders.
The Communication for the Friday meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party noted that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, GC meetings on Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not being held in this way, and the promise of a "better, better" political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the leadership of the party.
Things began to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I had previously disagreed with, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, whatever I say, it follows a wave of abuse on the dissocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination that I give evidence to my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion of censure or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have recommended that I put my head down in the last two years, stop being so vocal, and everything will be "good" like this.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence that Thatcher government showed led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who needed them most, as a local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including in the last elections.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on policy and issues that I do not agree with in relation to current leadership are unclear.
People who supported the motion Friday, I can only tell them that, in the context in which the country is heading to Brexit, which will affect the households, our businesses and our local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches top rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials have influenced the final result in some way, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive game today in Tennent's Premiership.
It is now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, everything came to terms with their better defense, as well as with the fact that they took more advantage of the opportunities that emerged, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
“We have undergone more tests during our matches so far, and we continue to be invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of chances more than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, granted him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a yellow cardon received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unprocessed test.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual test, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the field with the tarpaulin, and since the re-start of the game, Ayr was released through the attempt of player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unprocessed attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of a severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard because he plated Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to mark, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the test, as he did again near the beginning of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
Website view "Stilll Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems to be ready to move to the hospitality industry after he found out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the beloved BBC show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-time partner, the comedy actor Greg Hemphilll.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the number nine, will be the last, and it seems Kieman plans his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "restaurant industry".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval seat full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying through the blue flag like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, memory of a lost coast in the face of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary edge, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales , the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial struggle for the re-election of next year – also has much to gain from the month decision .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that there would be too little change if it happened.
The UN organization in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chile's territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final proceedings have been heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in the cause, but it's possible that the last four years might have given it back.
"The problem of access to sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk afterwards.
The two countries have no longer exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday he will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of disagreement with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most loving presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Northern Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if he could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to keep its promises made during a Singapore summit with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context that United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to resume diplomatic action on nuclear threats after more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "unreal sight" as the continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration on the end of the Korean war ever make northern territory fall.
Washington has reluctance to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who don't think the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or to protect you completely from the sun, you must no longer search.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked the participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-winter collection 2019.
Practical hats have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators have sent creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant beige hat, with a wide bour, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included marble-enhanced peppers, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bedding masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not have a high-cost fashion.
One of the creations seemed to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another seemed to be a cone with crushed ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of clothing, with oversized clothing items, you're lucky.
Stylists predict a return of huge caps in luxury fashion stores.
Oversized hats come back after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide boar, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat at all times that appeared on all socialisation networks led to the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, or of beach straw people, with as large a size as the model in the bathroom suit wearing it.
The orange bag of the raffie, with raffie fringes and a white leather handle, was the strength of the spring-winter collection 2019 “La Riviera” of Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week
The star stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach people in the luxury stores next summer, because the fashion creator has had such a powerful impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills, Essential to Global Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results at examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), are striving to provide services at the highest level of students and their parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and wanted subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are in the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools have shown that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French, and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as subjects, are held as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent curricula and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave them for the fight for the occupation of vacancies, 17% were awarded a language skills deficit.
Thus, language skills are becoming imperative for the preparation of young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a ability over the course of life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investment in language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have a greater chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to achieve, however, the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it (We have to do it).

LeBron will make his debut at Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost over for fans who want to see him LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in opening the Sunday presence against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains to settle.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers program in the presence.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the presence to get ready," he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled in the following week, which includes stops in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate chosen by him for the free seat of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections from the middle of the term of office, as republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally take place from West Virginia tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., East Coast time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's electoral rally in West Virginia online through the video live stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense because of allegations of improper sexual behavior, while the Senate's pending confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win a bit of land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "energising volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," Reuters said a spokesperson for Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be named.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the meeting this evening could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the elections at a difference of over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being run in the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel it into polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team proves determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple samples starting on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it's possible that the forsomma test on Saturday afternoon was the exact thing Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-inclining pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, all the more in the case of competitions like this.
So, where is their motivation now?
“They were leading us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this fall for a little motivation,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game starts to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won each three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with a lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those clams of holidays became more and more loud as the advance round, especially when it entered a crucial point by which it brought the score back to equality in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The strike he won at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think that the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth says.
So much for these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange couple, however adorable, of Europe won four out of four matches and it seems they can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not need any additional shot on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would ultimately lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun will hit Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Debates on the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he made a pair with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles to the first nine holes sunk Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve to be tracked by almost the interactions between pairs, given and bare counsels and the way a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this knuckle session has shown and that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, in particular the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing the fourballs and foursomes Saturday games with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
Inspired couples composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two victories in front of an hesitant Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs test and won the series with score 3 to 1.
The US opposed a more severe resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a couple named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in the four opening matches throughout Ryder Cup history.
After they crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they were superbly supported to defeat the disheartening Woods and the American novices Bryson Dechambeau with a score even clearer, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional genius eclipses, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the forsomma test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a road without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple samples, though, because they are the current trophy holders, Furyk's players need only an equal result.
However, after they were in the second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea declares that there is no "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday the United Nations that the extension of sanctions would deepen its confidence in the United States and that it was impossible for its country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global council that "significant measures were implemented in North Korea to prove their good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing location and non-proliferation commitment to nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any appropriate response from the US,” he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and under such circumstances we can't go unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family objections to Washington's opposing resistance to a "sampling" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it step by step, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US-based president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States said that the Phenian must first quit his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not responded to requests to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"THE US insists on the option "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, but it even objects against "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel us is an illusion that only people who do not know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: “If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US territory with rockets from North Korea after "The evil President" Trump called Kim a "man-rakit" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said that the work just started and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri at the height of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit the next month's Phenian again to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not very successful.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that he made "gangsterist threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed to dismantle a rocket launcher and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He told Kim that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing ‘macho’ culture that makes them participate in “all night” sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has found that, often, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even own the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type of US.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
“At the end, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why is this being said to me just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she said to The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section, the image of a room is presented, and students can click on coffee channels, curtains, sports pants and cards to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know we can’t change students’ behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking are on health," added Professor Czeisler.
Culture that makes students proud that they've learned all night still exists, says this, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have transformed sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said this, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after he took part in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar curriculum before entering this institution where the competition is successful.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking time, and to know what the harmful effects of the "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hits Gerrard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's coup sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team on Iberox wanted to win the first round of the 4-1 triumph in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga entered seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers didn't seem at any time able to match.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed the third place, behind Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could face other problems, because the referee of Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, it seems, thrown from the hair of the visiting team fans.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that easily won against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents during the match.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step propelled Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the middle missed a very good opportunity.
A deep shot of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took over, but they left the impression that they hope more than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he bumped into Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the request of the Colombian.
Rangers succeeded only two hits on the gate in the first performance, but the former Imbox porter, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the 34th minute goal of Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it or only for the effort put forward.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent Jacobs' deep focus.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept his calm and passed on to Menga, the one who finished with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted at the break when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave off immediately, when the extreme focused on Morelos, but impressive Kelly got out of the barrels to block him.
However, Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett who intercepted post-centre.
Holt's team could have extended its advantage in the final phases, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent with his head to the corner gate.
Glenn Middleton, reserved for Rangers, demanded a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30th, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count CONTINUATION...), is the day that was born, in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as it happened in the film "Cronado Bells" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played as cowboys with improbable inclinations to science:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of radioactivity atoms in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, I hear a lot of popcorn! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and are then reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results to patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a supportive diatribe of Trump, while wearing a MAGA cap, after the appearance at SNL.
Didn't get out too well
Kanye West was fled to the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he was planning to run for the 2020 elections.
After he played the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist broke out in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? Is he racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a screenplay in which Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star took Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, was taken over.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's diatrabe film was uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take over the West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had backstage problems because of his hedgehog.
"They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this cap."
I was assaulted!
They also told me I got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how far down I got?” he then said, “I'm going to get Superman's coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it out with love."
His comments attracted public hearings at least twice, and SNL team members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one of the team said to the publication: “In the studio there was a complete silence.”
West was invited as the last-hour replacement for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West picked up a lot of sparks when he played song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits of us: Thank you that you have defeated the crowd.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") whom I believe he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Prior to the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that he is now "the officially known daughter as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West breaks the tracks of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then in the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder for a stab at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhacklove, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected on Monday in the Belfast Court.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the throne Urzeala star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Urzeala Trons, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the presentation of these roles on the screen makes boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told him that "something wrong happened" and wondered how toxic masculinity could be managed in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from Urzeala Tronsuri, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, admitted that he is "very determined" to talk about this issue.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about it now: where did I wrong with masculinity?" he wondered.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are now facing?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and learned?
What do young boys on TV and on the street learn, what makes them think there has to be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our times: how can we change this?
Because it's clear something wrong happened to young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any way the series based on Urzeala Trons after the series ends in the summer of the year, saying that “he finished with the battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West Theatre by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is being cut off.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the Urzeala Trons series is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so she assured me of the future of my family and my life from now on," said Kit.
Rose played in Ygritte's role, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by the Kit in the fantasy series winning several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% of the number of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, say the health officials responsible for a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered highly widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission are derived from inappropriate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of Senators of the Republican Party, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic claimed that the accusations are made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Minds, lies and other misdeeds," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information disclosed included Senators' personal telephone addresses and numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and presented information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘Member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false charges, was not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the temper needed to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
They must not question the motive of the accused.
It must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by the Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that his office warned “the proper authorities and legal entities about these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered,” she continued, “and they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: parody without the veil of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to search for the meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new series of parody films of action films that has Johnny English as its main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English is back.
Will this zeflamizing satire of how strange we are to become the nation's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with staring eyes and rubber face, was renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The character's name first indicates that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the squeaked secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife peak of that type who contributed with a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and mystery man without the country that Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard commercials for TV, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor pallets slightly hit his helmet.
The gift Atkinson has for the physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, give confidently comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's exciting adventures are not as inventive and smart as Atkinson's silent movie gags when playing in Bean's role.
As usual, the premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the supersecret British spy web network and revealed the identities of British undercover agents, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettable role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister pompous and under siege, who is already suffering a serious crisis because of the fall of political popularity: Emma Thompson does all he can with his character like Theresia May, but the scenario does not give him the chance to shine.
His intelligence advisors inform him that all active spies have been compromised, so he must activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English's Zevzechus himself, now working as a teacher in a school for the top class, which also gives lessons on how to be undercover. Here are some cute gags, because English runs a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin created the messes in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ofelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the first minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technology industry that claims he can solve the IT problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start off in an odyssey of drunken adventures: dressed in waiters, set a fashion French restaurant on fire, create chaos when sneaking on board Volta's luxury boat, then English starts pure anarchy when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to get acquainted with Volta's home.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but, no matter how cute and colorful, it seems to be a children's television production.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As in the case of other films with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to measure his talent?
Labourers deny that they plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would work only four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) by giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not change.
The sources say that the idea would "match" with the party's economic programme, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of the workers.
The shift to the four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A leader of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “The policy review announcement is expected by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a good aspiration to approach the economy's rebalancing party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into consideration by the party.”
The Chancellor of the Umbrian Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to describe his vision for a social revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it was decided to take back the power from "faceless directors" and "profits" from utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor of the Umbrian Cabinet also relate to the fact that current shareholders of the water supply kings may not fully recover their actions, as the Labour Government may perceive “deductions” due to reported offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers at company management councils and to create property funds to transfer 10% of the private sector's own capital to employees, which will receive such annual dividends up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed its final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court by at least one week and raised the question whether Republican senators might be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI's findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer has been decided promptly, without error."
Graham's vote, though, seems dug in the rock.
“I’m decided on Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be a need for some explosive charges,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett is rejecting the accusations with determination,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the people named by it has confirmed the relationship.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something will change."
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen's Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to Central Park, not only to track artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (except if they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help to increase awareness of the global poverty elimination target.
But what success has Global Citizen's Festival had when it's only 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism, a concept that refers to people who feel they did something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded since 2011 by its supporters, who have promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, on the account of which at least $10 billion were already spent or tight.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with headquarters in the UK of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to “help children grow up to their full potential”, who promised to offer Rwande $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become only a footnote in the book of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will finance the project The Power of Nutrition, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements for civil or anti-apartheid rights that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will sing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval forces for a "blockage" which would hamper Russia's energy exports, the Secretary of the Interior said
Washington may, "if necessary", call on the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I am in the Middle East is that I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe as well as in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go out on the market," he said.
Zinke addresses participants at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said about Russia, saying that it "knows only one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come at a time when Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 conduit, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is fuelled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at things the same way: energy can't be an instrument to put pressure on consumers and they should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, energy minister in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted critics from Germany, who reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state intervening in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren thinks "serious" to run the presidential elections in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he had to "think seriously" about running presidential elections after elections in the middle of his term.
During the meeting at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering an application.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that it takes a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll seriously think about running presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "normal that we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's voters think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of him and 48% are against him.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin is suffering from at a meeting of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after he joined September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
“The things my own son goes through, which he went through after his return... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the aftermath of the wounds that our soldiers return to,” said the public gathered at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other war veterans "returned a little different, harder, wondering whether there was respect for what they and their soldiers from the armed forces and the air, as well as all other members of the Army, made for the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and possession of a state-of-the-art firearms, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the Columbia District contests a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to give asylum to victims who are trying to escape violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed an amicious request in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum-seekers policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that her partner "and her sons, members of a gang," abused her, but the US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a generalised problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy cancelled a 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle", writes the amicious curiae request.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour force”.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges in June for cases of immigration to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape the abuse and violence of chickens.
"Assimilation is granted to those who leave the country facing persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion," the Sessions said on 11 June, when he announced politics.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where death numbers doubled, in a race against timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who licks her baby suffering from fever at a evacuation center in the city destroyed Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous repetitions.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris said to Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda claims"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising in a US daily where it praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the US press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of mixing in the November 6th Congress elections, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to get mixed up in US elections marked what US officials said to Reuters that it is a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, which involves surges in import tariffs.
The rates imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of an advertising in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," Branstad says.
“In return, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will see no real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what paper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before elections in the middle of the mandate due to Kavanaugh scandal, alert analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, with several charges of sexual abuse, analysts warned that there would be a counter-action, especially on the part of women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely powerful, and most Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"The reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that the last-minute initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (the representative of Arizona) on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scanned "Come November!" as they demonstrated at the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue the process of Kavanaugh's nomination in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be very great," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site said.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the charges of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it might follow a counter-reaction if the republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This turned into a mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Republican Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA, an electoral support group of Democrats for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided on the part that they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little more seem to believe it at the end.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe that it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said that they believe it strongly or that it is likely that Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, drunk, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archive" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all of a sudden.
What is unique about this personal data archive online is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt will contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday post on the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War are celebrating
The only clergy of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his birthplace after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucort.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he was awarded the greatest military honour of Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden Parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that he was “carried by symbol” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked by himself a nest of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing I know I will never equal, but that makes me feel worthless.”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he is “very honored to play a role in parade” and added that “the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him.”
The MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you couldn't follow the main event.
The San Jose event programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was getting ready to face Rory MacDonald, the spectators in Britain were amazed when the transmission was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
One fan described Twitter as the move to the cartoon for children as "a kind of stupid joke."
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said that in the future, they would plan their events in such a way that they could also be followed by spectators from Britain.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably solve it,” Coker said.
"But it's six mornings on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will sum up to five battles instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give the fans more and exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he is inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he arrived at school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay people's rights to give them "hope."
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional show, will be missing for a few months because of a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and the resistance to gain success.”
He wanted to prove that he is "someone," he said, so he doesn't disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics became a renowned LGBT champion and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to talk because he felt lucky that he could live free, without a trace, and because he wanted to give up another “hope”.
The World Threeth Champion said that "it was taken by surprise" that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the winner of the Oscar Prize, which is 20 years older than he did, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many at such a tender age" - he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has been through the same good and bad moments.
The two became in June the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his whole perspective.
“If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing but winning a gold medal,” he said.
"You know what? There are things more important than gold medals at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with cerebral cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't say to him "you won't be able to be first, Dad," he said.
“I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing and hardly after he no longer breathed and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that’s what I dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country to the Olympics, there’s no more beautiful sensation,” he said.
This inspired him also in the chosen music, Proud de Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still stirs him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the 4th and 7th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to return to a good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on to Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as was often the case for the United States team, the winning major tournaments split the day between being a major team member and exercising their shots, hoping that he would correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the right drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow field of Le Golf National, where long areas of rough often punish the wrong shots.
And if the land is not a big enough challenge, in the ninth Sunday Mickelson match will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous champion of British Open, who joined the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely crucial for Americans, leading four points at the entrance into the 12 simple matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on the shoulder, hugged me, and told me that he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I've imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which did not rise to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, he likes to joke with the players, he's a wonderful guy in the team locker room," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do this during the week.
Its role is more important, it's not just about the game."
Captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros drove the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
“I remember having a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely won,” Bjorn said after following how the 2018 team, who won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play the maximum shift.
Let's get out on the ground and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know what we expect in the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his players managed a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I am not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
It's a different situation tomorrow.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golf player.
That's the message you have to send to the players, that you have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better at the simple test than they did with the partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe succeeded the "miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in a direction, put a lot of pressure on those mid-games.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wish, you know, we try to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was drawn the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans from the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think they cover all the subjects," Bjorn said about the game for simple proof.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany's newest naval power frigate should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships in the Cold War, but this will only happen by year, due to the default systems and rising costs, local press reported.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" vessel, the standard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg mill, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which reads a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but post-delivery issues affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old mills in the Bremen class.
It is assumed that they will be foreseen with a strong cannon, with a range of anti-air and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as with stealth technologies, which ensure a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to leave for two years without returning to the original port.
However, continuous delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase German maritime force, will already be aged before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 frayed sniper was discussed in the press last year, when the German Military Navy officially refused to take the boat and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media quoted a crucial number of "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a battle mission.
The software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it was proved that the vessel was too heavy a weight, which reduced its performance and limited the military Navy's ability to add future supplies.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as hard as the ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the default mechanisms, the price of the entire project, including that of training the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached the impressive 3.1 billion euro (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Commission, acknowledged that the Military Navy "has begun to run out of vessels that can be sent to missions".
The officer said that the problem has grown steadily over time, as the old vessels have been removed from office without being replaced with new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class rubbed into the Military Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a property of the Scottish Highlands want to reveal how they use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear and water bats from the Inverew Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key places around the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of bat sounds and what species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grass, and which is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are musket traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated greening technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Three House in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland are found.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Three, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to grow."
It emphasises the importance of looking for bats before doing property maintenance work, as simply unintentional destruction of a mother nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape while lawyers prepare to sue Germany's magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "wanted to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of raping a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the accusations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for the 142 million followers of his 33-year-old Ronaldo said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the winner of the Golden Ball in front of the video camera.
“I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of these charges, which they called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will ask for compensation for “moral damage equivalent to an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would take place in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual intercourse with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Majorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photos with her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted a deal outside the courtroom because she was "terrorized by the possibility of a vengeance" and was worried that she would be "demeaned publicly".
The 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain “would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever”
Britain "would regret forever" if it lost the status of world leader in vehicle production after Brexit, said Secretary for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK told BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays on a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It seems to me that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Mr. Marvin Cooke, Toyota Executive Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that, after Brexit, he will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the time-fix principle: for machines manufactured on the order, the parts arrive at 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border problems could arise, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more of the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Chequers Plan of Theresa May for future EU relations is "precisionally balanced to avoid these delays at the border".
"There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for the BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also from other producers shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the factory in the long term and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsoovallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "Experience has taught me that once these jobs are gone, they will not return."
A government spokesman said, "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled another week," because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continues, said White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in elections, links between Trump's aid to Russia and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
The rumors about Trump firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington's circles for months.
At the beginning of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was then at the New York headquarters of the United Nations.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a week-long FBI inquiry into charges against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week or it may be a week, taking into account all the other things that are now happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always like to keep the press up."
Some reporters would challenge this statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Gasda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy with TV reporters, whom they like to perform, although he added: “I do not deny that they like to give themselves to the show.”
Then he suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The President participates in more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analysed the figures."
"There will be briefings," Sanders said, but "I think it is much better for the press to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you could notice that we've done this many times in the past few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries visiting him.
His exclusive press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre places, in front of the reporters assembled.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed, in a letter, to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on concerns related to Brexit
The State Secretary wrote to EU employees working at the Scottish NHS branch to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under the conditions of less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, awaiting decisions in this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is under emergency surgery after he has suffered a head blow
The Tennessee State Tigers Foundation, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after having suffered a head blow on Saturday, in the match that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with the score of 31-27, said Mike Organ de la Tennessee.
Senior coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place shortly before the break.
"It reached the line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie's oxygen mask was put on the line by the physical and medical trainers, before he sat on a tarpaulin and transported him off the ground for a thorough evaluation.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/wide of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in the year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to do five plates in total before leaving the match, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.

This change will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting right-of-voting young people
Tax on stamp will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury is expected to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of the stamp court fee to buy a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as you are going to announce today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with voting rights, promising homes with higher prices and targeting people with large incomes.
The higher tax will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxed and taxed in the United Kingdom, and the additional money obtained in this way will be used to support the government's efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which adds to the current tax on stamps, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring a plus of up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "matom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend a lot of time outside the country.
The new policy is only a few weeks since Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax on stamps to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high prices on properties as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Thersei May to waive taxes on affordable houses for the purpose of resolving the UK 'home problem'.
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive reforms in the real estate sector, including rent checks and the cessation of unwarranted evacuations.
He also wants to offer the Councils higher powers with regard to the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I have said that I will devote my prime minister’s mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means I'm remedying the problems in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with offices abroad, can buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a much too distant one, and life in unrequited conditions is far too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of the national team of Scotland"
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the national team of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotian enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the North-East club, which is now on 3rd place in the First League, with a difference of three points to the first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium team this summer after he managed, last season, to return to the St. Mirren football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the B team of the nation and so much," Ross told the Sportssound at BBC Scotland.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland's games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland Club, are Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic said he has no emotion to be the successor to such consecrated names and to such an important club, after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make her get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the return of the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a time when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club return after it went back to division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team to win the title of champion next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a turning point," he said about taking control of the Alloa club.
“I really thought that my role as manager was more appropriate than that of a player.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we won well, and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I deal with similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel that it is the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be manager and now that I can do that, I feel that it's the thing that fits me best in my entire adult life."

The ideal time to drink a beer beers is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
This summer’s heat flow has led to an increase in revenues in the British pubs, but put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA company that provides business consulting services and carried out the survey, said: “Constant security and England’s participation in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a print in July, similar to the one in the previous month, when pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers smaller than 1.8% in the restaurants industry in June declined even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs serving food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
It seems that people have gone out in town just to consume drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs have grown by 6.6% this month, and food has dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM company providing services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather conditions and impact of sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales of the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the downturn of sales by 4.8% a year will add to current cost pressures.
Long summer cannibals could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, being the official standard in the industrial sector.
One of five children has a secret account on a socializing network that parents hide from
According to a survey, one in five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a socializing network that parents and teachers hide from
A survey carried out at the level of 20,000 gymnastics revealed an increase in the "false" accounts
The news increased fears about sexual posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that parents have
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socializing network that keeps them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed a rapid increase in the accounts "false to Insta", referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The news increased fears about sexual posts.
20% of students said they owned a "principal" and "clean" account that they showed their parents, but they also had other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the posting of a teenager who wanted to be "violated".
According to research carried out by the company Digital Awareness of the United Kingdom and the association of directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) in independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they hold secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes in the Commission of the Scottish Atlas
Eilidh Doyle was chosen as Director without Executive Power at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to take advantage of the vast experience that she has acquired internationally in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, Britain, as well as throughout the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits when it is included in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I am pleased that I am able to represent athletes and hope that I have a real contribution and can help how sports activities are taking place in Scotland.”
American Nationality Atlas, which has won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games along with the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commenter at the BBC, has remained invalid after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An advertising in breast pumps that compares women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast-producing company has led to the division of public opinion into the online environment with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cow-weeding.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic commercial, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I thank myself, but I didn't tail" and "if you didn't notice, they're not ugly, but my boobs."
The refresher continues: “Pumping, pumping, feeding the baby, pumping, pumping, extracting the milk from the girls.”
However, the advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them saying that it reveals the “goldiness” in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days from birth," wrote one person.
Elvie breast pump matches discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/mother)
Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep babies?"
Someone added: "A very inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the complaint, claiming that it seemed like a hilarious advertisement.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a little bitch.
The complaint is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun advertisement that targets mothers who use the pump (sometimes at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘vacues’.
It is not an advertising that praises or judges the lactate industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like their cousins.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility to hold their children in arms and even to get out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in the design at Mother commented: “Elivie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing nursing mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what is meant by the use of a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of the fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the podium appeared the mother of two children while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred underground to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of retained migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult to place children to sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking customs and immigration officer (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Subsequently, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the child system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court at one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for in the previous standard, according to the employees of shelters.
Many will plead for the case by means of a video call, not personally in front of a court of immigration, to apply for the status of legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to employees of shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
The lawyers stated that these concerns are accentuated by a greater unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that the signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough emotional training or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria had been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the Acting Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory, under the pretext of countering terrorism and that "the situation will be managed appropriately".
‘It must withdraw immediately and without any condition’, he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions were uprooted from their own homes.
He also said that Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, who are particularly involved in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, there are more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-stricken country.
Regarding the refugee problem, Moualem said that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “abstaining irrational fears”, which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "I have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return."
"Political influences are brought to a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomas state that an agreement recently concluded between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to ward off the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large-scale assault by the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which would "be eradicated".
The United Nations Emissary, the Mist Officer, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee of government members and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare for the election.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning on interference.
Why will Trump win second term?
If we are going to follow this logic, Trump will be realised in 2020, unless the removal procedure or the scandals will end his presidential term earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without any doubt, “the most dramatic end of a term of president of all time! ”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, at first glance, the Fox News TV station is being tracked on average by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was being followed by 1.7 million, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has recorded a record of audience, with 3.5 million people who have watched it in the evenings where important news has been broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the ABC's "Reservation President" drama series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
"He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Scovell said to me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that can only allow the privileged audience.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of viewing the debate by a committee of experts on how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("an opulent clothing object", according to The Washington Post) and the shockingly significant implications of the actress Storm Daniels's "anatomical parts" of Trump.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A large part of what it does makes you feel like you're looking at a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the "Ays of the Apple" show, about the constantly changing distribution and the changes in daily situations caused by Trump (declaming a deal with the American Football Professional League, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un).
You're not allowed to lose an episode, because you're gonna feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the northern shore of the Kauai island, there were 27 degrees outside and it was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
There was no way to get rid of the TV, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and the future Supreme Court was going to decide.
"I remember we were performing some of the shows that came out of the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

Extensive external financial resources for the tightest intermediate elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, of which two holders of the mandate resulted in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg has raced the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections from last spring.
Lamb runs against another senior executive, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, being manipulated the boundaries of the districts in favour of the republicans.
The competition in the 17th new electoral district has sparked a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Committee of Congress for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections, of maximum audience, held in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, the democracies enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States has taken into account the criminalisation of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but has then waived
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to call the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the department in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were taken only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
Since internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting since last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migration towards the United States.
But by mid-September, officials from the front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any sanctions examination for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of keeping the anonymity.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the report of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, who now has solid evidence made public.
Moreover, Mueller seems to be focusing on investigating the existence of a plot between Trump's and Russia's campaign on the attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when he prepares to appear before the voters and possibly a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, and that is true for its counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on one side and on the other side of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to give a state strike against Hitler only if the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans face a few such critical moments right now.
What are we going to do if Trump's delegating Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested the President's registration in secret and speculated on his incompatibility with his role as President.
Rosenstein said the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote in middle elections for a Congress that will take back Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-speaking Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied me, long ago, the ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with sand.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Thursday, Rangers will be host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the equally impressive Spanish against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow half Graham Dorrans to play this season up to 2-2 with Villarreal, but it considers that the Rangers team can use this result to its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, considering Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
“I started the game thinking that we’ll get a good result and win a point.
We'd probably be able to sign up at the end, but, by the way, I think equality was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first round, and we've noticed better in the second.
Thursday, it will be an important evening for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having support, we will certainly feel more motivated and have a positive result.
Last year it was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave the last season behind and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnias because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study carried out by the Nationalwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husband/wife.
Only 10 percent of them said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you do not make your time wishes known.
Work with the councillor and the family to discuss the place and way in which you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve the financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be a real help in paying these expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care may include a long-term standard insurance policy, a cash-based mixed life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Draw up legal documents: come to the face of legal problems.
Get an authority on medical decisions to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also take into account the implementation of an authority on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the ability to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draft a plan for all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while walking home after a night spent in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m., as "accidential shooting".
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The wounds suffered do not endanger his life, and the police have called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and expect the number of deaths to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala residence, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of the island of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow golf course on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The town was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a queen that stretches on a coast with an area of more than 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The Region, an administrative region below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the provinces, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, too, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala’s reign, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, aged 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman's knowledge of her sex tried to call the police to plead the alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody, at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is held on the basis of a bail-free pay, worth $500, according to KTUU.
He presented himself on Saturday in court, where he declared himself "100% innocent" when he was asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three class A criminal charges, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to one year and amended by $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin's charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Alaska Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and having a gun in possession while he was drunk with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deceased people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred outside the central province of Sulawesi, north-east of Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Socialization networks circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Attorney wants capital punishment for the terrorist attack suspect in New York City
The New York Federal Attorney wants the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack after which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
It seems Saipov, 30-year-old, used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side motorway of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bikers on his trajectory in October.
To justify the capital punishment, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov “in will” killed the eight victims and caused “in will” serious bodily injuries, according to the intentional opinion on the application of the capital punishment, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, a high federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges that include eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "substantial planning and premeditation", said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "hateful, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, sufferings and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but finally, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy on the commission of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's husbands were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months after the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he likes what he did, according to the words of the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after he looked at the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the solicitor.
Also, according to the police, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocently in respect of the 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the defenses in the office who represented Saipov, said they are “evidently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment conviction, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the associated trauma for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply the capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament that is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage promised that he would “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians must “ feel pressure” from Euroseptics, following a statement by a Member of the Parliament of Theresia May who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, MP of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" until now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, May's challenge in the area of extremely divided camps was accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the European Union's exit in the city.
The Prime Minister tries in his support as his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, to proceed properly, facing the attacks on those who support the European Union, those who want to remain in it and on the part of the European Union.
The Allies stressed that she will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Euroseptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and "haos".
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wants to "renunciate to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were driven by him, we were no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in the world war to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on changing public opinion to the 2016 vote: “It is not true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people’s voices.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with him or our activists who come out of the street and support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message on Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers who keep their duties are those who keep their promises."
At the meeting, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be put in a position to “sympathize with pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do this."
In a message sent to enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We are moving the civilian army of the country that has brought our victory to Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that the Conservative Party wrote against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the digitisation of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a joke.
Brexit does not bring benefits," he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running after the November elections.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic Senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a city hall meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of Donald Trump, is running for real in November's elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that Trump could win in 2020.
The afternoon afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of citizens with voting rights using the format of the city since Trump took over as president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to arrive in Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and this included a woman in his forehead."
A suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of player Sims from the LSU team
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of death that caused the death of the basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original batch in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the race.
Finding his first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box later and came back from Vettel's back, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back of the carriage and was on the seventh place near the end of the first tour, even the day he was 21 years old.
Then he found himself at the forefront for a large part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to get past Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the boxing at the 44s, but he couldn't step up in the last eight laps, Raikkonen staying on fourth place.
"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me get ahead.
And the team has done an excellent job to gain victory in front of Ferraris and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Horrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironed the Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday, as part of a rally on the subject of her insistence, that she did not facilitate the "broadcasting" of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what happened in the Senate showed that people are "bad, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and liars," he said.
"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the "dispatch" of the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
We did this?.No, I didn't do it," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scuttle" in September, but Feinstein denied that "scattering" occurred from her office.
"I haven't hidden the charges that look at Ford, and I'm not the one that made it easier to "snap" her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to Hill.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not appear to have been well spoiled by the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice that evil, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars team wins 5-3 in front of Belfast's Giants team
Patrick Dwyer wrote two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Dundee Stars team paid for the loss of Friday of the Elite League, winning in front of the Belfast Giants team in the return game on Saturday, with the 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants team had a two goal advance, the blows being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie matched the score before Dwyer brought Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equaled the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League in this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who had recovered land by defeating the Dundee team on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening performance was triggered in the fourth minute, 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's step, then David Rutherford moved on to Beauvillier, who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan brought the host team back to the game in the minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the chance to score for an equal score in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants team's advantage before the first break when he entered his second goal at the end of the first round.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again matched an impressive goal in the minutes of 27:37.
Later, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team's climb to 5th place in the ranking, in the middle of the last round.
The Giants team, who has now lost four of the last five matches, will be, Friday, host to Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake.
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after he secured the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong lines in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of Palu city.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunanang Grand, aged 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower at Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which is on the runway at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he noticed that he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian air navigation service provider said it was possible to save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a higher hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at the Palu.
“We are in pain with this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency saying that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will grow, because many victims are still under ruins and we haven't had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The valleys with a height of up to six metres devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday a common funeral will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings victims every minute.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All minimals are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia rushes to provide help to survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to perform all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which had more than 550 dead soldiers.
Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline holding the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declares that a person is missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger is missing since the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they are all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and exact order of events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses think the plane crossed the end of the track.
American national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross water, which had reached the brink, and reached the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Naval Forces said that sailors who worked nearby for the renovation of a boatman jumped in help, using a inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks 30 meters below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents by air companies registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
An analyst presents the timing of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the D.A. closed its plea with regard to the resumption of the trial for an accused man who burned alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst within the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to lead Quinton Tellis's 29-year-old actions, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received locating data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, this being contrary to his earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and confessed that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "liest, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Cell phone records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that soon after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin on Sunday's final plea.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, using songs with positive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that the hip hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social problems, as it initially did.
They want to return to their origins and make the hip-hop aware to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another color person?
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her after she received a “resistant” text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after she accidentally received a text message from her mother, in which she complained that she was “still a colored person”.
The couple denied that they were racists, claiming that she sued him for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was colorful, when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUUUUU! Even a color person," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gap, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not properly perform her duties and expected to receive a baby Filipino national, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to pay compensation for her dismissal and requests the amount of $350 a day for six months, the period in which she was to live with them and carry out her activity, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that these things are not done," she said Friday to the Post paper, adding "I know it's about discrimination."
The couple denied the claim that they were racists, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent him a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post paper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have wronged, even if you were mistaken?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process a "extortion" action, Plasco said his wife will be born in two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
“ Do you really want to take revenge on a person under such circumstances?
Don't do that," added the bank investor.
While the process is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple of social networks, judging them for the behaviour and logic they have shown.
Paddington's story editors feared that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
This further stated that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary with the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was a "duce-merue" after he died last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to praise himself," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington his merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
At the landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"It doesn't ring often to tell me it's very serious and he doesn't think he'll survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors to keep her heart pumping her blood started to decrease and get out of her body.
He died a little while ago and the organs started to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperuse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what was going on.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
I realized she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two bereaved women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, aged 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a molybdenum smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your disposition."
However, he gave up at work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his life.
Davis said, "I'm always thinking it's going to have a domino effect."
This created the messages “to pass on to people that they can call on someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out of the way, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, the 15-year-old life partner, at little time since his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a pitiful state on Christmas Day, when the children gave their presents and didn't even look at them in the eye."
She said that her death was a great trauma to them, but she must overcome it: “It has caused a great pain in the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for – an investigation for a limited time and a small extent – we could have little unity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission was about to “disintegrate” on the back of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the time factor.
It is only five weeks before the 6 November elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want to win at the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has been making calls to the senators to convince him to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of fugitives falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean parliamentary.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said last year they ran away from the country about 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the harsher border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by those transporting illegal people across the border.
The Phenian made no public comment.
A vast majority of northern fugitives are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers them more illegal migrants than refugees and often repatriates them forced.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still practically in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had the subject of the negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un from Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that U.S. sanctions have caused a lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, in no case will we be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "historical", saying he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court as “steriously” and said that his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made his comments on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if she were a woman in this situation, she would have been declared “steric,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s legal commission, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that she was sexually harassed on Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder", organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony had shown that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if you don’t tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then it’s not right, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now,” Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Appeal Court of the Columbia District.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Care Law or the Roe versus Wade case, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be reversed.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical person to go to court and expect us to say, “Well, how wonderful,” Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of accumulated anger and can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was also crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me complaining.
I'm angry."
And then continue.
I thought it was a brilliant thing."
The tears are allowed for the exteriorisation of the anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I started crying because of an inexpressable rage, is that I was grabbed by the back of an older woman, a cold director who I always felt a little afraid of, and took me to the stairs.
"He must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad you've caused this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in an extra-conjugal relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run even to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very good decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as Snow and the Seven Pitches".
Because the campaign was at its end, she was behind the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't go into the race if she couldn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given them to men $1,000, gave them only $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of the emotions .
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the media’s reactions to her.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my funeral stone.
"Did she cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
The salvations that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although there seems to be a long way to go until it is concluded, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively applying taxes for half of all goods from China that reach the territory of the United States.
Beijing has avenged each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent for US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but public surrender to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, United States trade war pressures could support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been anticipated so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is prepared for the return of refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the spot are more stable and secure, thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
Existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at day-to-day life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after defeating the American team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned first after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn obtained 14.5 points, necessary to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot into the water to the 3rd hair from the 16th hole, giving up Francesco Molinari's match.
Italian golf player Molinari had an incredible performance in all the seasons, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost in holes 5 and 4 in front of the player from the last place in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost in holes 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t get used to crying, but today I can’t help myself.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
It gives him the status of his conacional, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game, Sunday.
“I am very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm said, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being just over Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary during the entire tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the American team said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they have really worked out.
This morning, there were a few moments when we put pressure on the European team.
I've been fighting a skull.
Take off the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than we did."
