Welsh members are worried if they're 'looking like a muppets' doll.
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that their names should be changed to MWPs.
This is due to the plan to change Majelis's name to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs all over the political spectrum are worried if it can invite any commotion.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's called a Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the Council (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "not happy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" about the change of names, but he judged that this was a fight from the MWP's departure to Muppet.
In this context the letters w in the Welsh language are spoken as the letters u in the English language Yorkshire.
The Majelis Commission of the present-day drafting of laws to introduce the name's change, says: "The final decision on any explanation of the names for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government’s 2017 decision gave Majelis Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known to have broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament an assembly.
With regard to the issues referred to by the AMs, the Committee preferred the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Member of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option gained the most support for public consultation.
AM seems to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can disqualify the leader, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the plans of the bills to the changes within a few weeks.
These reforms will include other changes in the way in which the work is done, including the rules for discualization for AMs and committee system plans.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they discuss the debates.
The Macedonian people went to give a voice on the referendum on the change of country names
The voice owners will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
The popular vote was held in an effort to settle disputes for a decade with the Greek neighboring country, which also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long argued that the name of the neighbouring country to her north shows a confession against her region and has repeatedly rejected the offer of the European Union and NATO.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice protester for a change of name, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Minister Zoran Zaev’s Prime Minister, see it as a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St.Martin's bells don't dance when the church in Harlem is in trouble
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and church at every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there is none."
He said that all the bars could be cleared.
"People socialize in another way" now, he says.
"But it's no longer the community's living room around where people visit it regularly."
As well as with the church, he was worried that the money from the sale of assets would not last long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who wouldn't help keep the sacred places around it.
"The majority of the people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up the day when these churches close together because it's impossible for those who move to the condominium to be members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the city of black metropolis - Metropolitan Communities in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that has been worshiping in the surrounding area has taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a rough trade boycott on 125th street, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
Fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parish was planning to rebuild, they built tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin proudly named the tower bell as "Lonceng the poor people"
An expert who ransacked the tower bell in July gave him another word: "A treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind, who played the largest tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin over the past few months is a complicated history of architecture and contractors, some brought by mainstream church leaders, and the others brought by the Episcopal leadership.
Westry's directors, who are formed by the leaders of the public, wrote a letter to the authorities in July with concern that the authorities "will endeavour to burden the costs" on the governments, although thevestry is not involved in the architects and contractors sent by the authorities.
Some parish communities complained about the lack of transparency from the authorities.
Shark wounded 13-year-old teens in lobster rescue in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobsters in California at the lobster opening event, a officer said.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a moment of excitement after catching lobsters, but then he "discovered" that the boy screamed, 'I bit!
I'm bitten!'
The whole cellbone was torn apart," Hammel said that he realized it when he reached the child.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles Beach Rescuer said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week before, but it was categorized as an harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities close access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles realizes that there are over 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan broke the English beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty kiosks in a toss styled toss that were managed by assistant specialists.
As part of a substantial push towards the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household appliances down, the larger beauty kiosk will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves to be successful.
Investment in beauty became a single hunt for supermarkets to take advantage of the shelves used as a TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said that it would double the offer of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current pattern of brands starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with a branded area like that found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched the makeup of its boutiques so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something increasingly popular by young shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer will test the consequences of the two Sainsbury stores, which were first opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of the year.
Online shopping and switching on daily food needs in small numbers at local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sainsbury, has said that the generations will become more and more like Mall when the chain of supermarkets tries to fight back the strains like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and non-food services.
Sainsbury has put Argos' generations in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since they bought the two wards two years ago, which he has been supporting the sale of daily food and making more profitable acquisitions.
The previous supermarket's effort to renovate the beauty and pharmacy department ends with failure.
Sainsbury tested the imaging effort with Boots in early 2000, but the joint work ended after a conflict over how to divide the profits from the chemical store in that supermarket.
New strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of fancy leather treatments including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and nuances of beauty kiosks to repair the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invested with trained colleagues who would be ready to offer advice.
The pattern of our brand is designed to suit all needs, environment and comfortable locations that indicate that we are currently becoming a binding target for the long way of shopping."
Peter Jones 's move' after Holly Willoughby pulls himself off a £11 million deal
The Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones went ‘with rage’ after TV show host Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million life-style business deal to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the brand of household appliances and their accessories, Truly.
This couple's business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of this morning, 37-year-old, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones is angry at drawing himself in the last few moments, from their profitable lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source states that Jones was so "smooth" when the golden girl TV admitted during a elaborate meeting on Tuesday at her business center office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - means she doesn't have enough time to serve on the brand of household equipment and their accessory, Truly.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is estimated to double the wealth of Willoughby's £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britannia to one of his vacation homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be a long-term future, which would make it last for several decades.
His decision to turn away from such an easy way of life impressed all concerned.
No one can believe what is happening on that Day.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe that the travel of This Morning, one of the most expensive British stars, can cost companies up to millions of dollars because of a large investment in product form, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, as well as the potential for further launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined the lead in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of Baldwin's own TV production company.
Willoughby will be the ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously 'and then we fall in love'
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news media because he made comments that some people considered "non-presidential" and had been very positive toward the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said with his "news-reading" son of a bitch.
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea's delinquency.
But the denuchinization negotiations have stopped.
Over three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the highest diplomat in North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to the world's leaders on Saturday that North Korea didn't see any "appropriate responses" from the United States against the early North Korean weapons movement.
Rather, he noted that the United States continued to hold pressure - related sanctions.
Trump was more optimistic about his speech.
"We do our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this extraordinary relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing relations with Kim has brought positive results - stopping rocket attempts, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he's defending his inappropriate approach to talking about relationship with Kim.
"Very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this terrible arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami Indonesia and the Earthquake Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, nongovernmental foreign organizations were told that they were unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no declaration of national disasters, as a pre-arrangement to provide international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so it's a bit challenging," says Mrs. Subland.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesperson for a national disaster relief agency, said that the Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if the foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to help.
In view of the earth’s continued global turmoil in Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared to deal with natural anger.
While the tsunami shelter had been built in Aceh, it was not a public sight on the other coast.
There are no tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings of danger have been made, probably have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, the trip between many Indonesian islands was very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The nursing hospital that has been located in the Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to the Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new location of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia's broken infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on building highways and railway tracks.
But lack of funds has disturbed Mr. Joko’s government as he faced his re-election next year.
Mr. Joko was also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members had embraced a more conservative form of belief.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes when the Muslim and Christian mobs were fighting on the streets, using parachutes, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.

The death victim from the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The death toll on the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832 people, state disaster agencies on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the collapse of a 7.5 scale earthquake - stricken Richter scale on Friday and sparked a 20 - foot - tall wave, says Sutopo Purwo, the agency spokesperson at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with debris that collapses.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on a murder charge after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
44-year-old woman found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with some stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on a murder charge.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come face - to - face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at its earliest stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's street at Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also sent to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman she found was the local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who are convinced that they knew the woman had come to the scene to wonder where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police have said, they're in the process of telling relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just went back to his apartment, but told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer sounds telling someone that all the areas are now being treated as a scene of trouble.
A woman appears at the place in tears.
He always repeats 'this is so terrible'.
At two o'clock two police vans are in line and the other one is outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The Plague of the Cromwell Parliament became the last memorial of the ‘story rewriting’
His exorcism will be a poetic justice for the destruction of the seas of the many British cultural and religious artifacts that the Puritans are doing.
But Cromwell's people describe Mr. Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "the attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "this cannot be avoided in the debate at this time about the destruction of the statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace will be the target.
The English Civil War Iconoclasm was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell offspring would be sacrificed for Thomas’s ancestors’ actions in the previous century.
An extraordinary representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th century views and part of historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defense against external pressure, in case of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, still being the subject of ongoing historical debate.
Surely, conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is an individual-recognized figure representing one side of the difference.
The success of the Lord of the Guardians is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killing Pigs Enduring Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a southeast Chinese market, according to a local media report.
The man, identified only by the name "Yuan", was found dead with broken arteries, covered in blood near a pig cage in the market area of Liupanshui province Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from the neighboring region of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the pig cage doors nearby have opened.
He said that in the pig cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that male pigs with a weight of 550 pounds have persecuted the farmer to death, according to the report.
"Betish my cousin was bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin who was known to be "Wu," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuan to enter the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to the Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent the attack of others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities were reported to be negotiating compensation for her death.
Although rare, pig cases against humans have happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts causing the man to get hurt.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds had lured a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife was terrified and evicted the beast.
After a farmer Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the aroma of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just messing around.
They bite, very much to know... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa storm brought rain to the southwest of the United States.
As an estimate, the Rosa storm was weakened as it moved over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa would rain rain all over the northern and southwest parts of the United States a few days to come.
Rosa has a wind of 85 mph, a storm of category 1, starting at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday in the East, and is 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's probably moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pallar began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward toward the U.S. West Coast, when Rosa approached the U.S. Baja peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push the tropics northward to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching prowl will create heavy rain in the West of the World for a few days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause hazardous floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause a rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is estimated to fall in some parts of West Day, especially in most of Arizona.
Faint pollution is likely to occur with a rapidly deteriorating condition due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It is highly uninvited to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn the cliff into a violent river, resulting in a strong, dusty, local wind.
Closers will cause heavy local rain to some of the coast of South California.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and smooth the roads.
It's going to be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before it becomes wider on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to four quarters on Tuesday and survive until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great changes in temperature across the U.S. when Arctic gets colder, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in the short distance.
There is a precise example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. area in the middle of the Sunday.
There are nearly 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer warmth will be formed and re-populated.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the U.S. region are expected to start warm in October at a speed of 80s from the South to parts of the East Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate estimates show a high chance of temperature above average for the eastern U.S. until the early mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people saw an interesting statement on Thursday by the candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexual violence that was suspected in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political failures continue, with the presence of publishers on a regular basis to announce unexpected events in the last minute of Friday: A deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charge.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh took her body drunk and tried to take off her clothes at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it wasn't happening.
Possibly more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counts the average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The calculations for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the number of people who see him at the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers that's almost the same as the playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose audience's opinion is very supportive of Kavanaugh's performance, out of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, says Nielsen.
The ABC has a second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest stays high after the trial.
Flake was a key player in that Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican Party office made a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he caught CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being scolded by a reasoner when he tried to lift the elevator to the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was bitten by maki, broadcasted directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."'
Flake said that her office had made a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things she needed to say in the committee congregation.
The cable and broadcasting networks were all wired live a few hours later, when the Justice Committee would choose to defend Kavanaugh's appeal throughout the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he'd only do that with the understanding that the FBI would check charges against the candidate for a week ahead, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been assured part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
Past a conversation with Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republican party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critic of Brexit's 'political play'
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and ruining national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that showed him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, said that the proposal about England and the EU that has to collect each other's tariffs was "the absolute nonsense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU players.
The police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on a second-degree murder charge, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officer released a video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said he lost his eyeglasses during a fight.
The police found those glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the stuff, WAFB's affiliate CBS reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he claimed he had committed a fatal shooting against Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
Coroner's East Baton Rouge parish office released an advance report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a head injury to the neck.
The department thanks the police officer for the office of the Louisiana State Police Department, the state police, the Southern University police, and the people around to assist in the investigation that leads to arrest.
Athletes director LSU Joe Alleva thanks the local law enforcement for "execution and quest for justice."
Sims was 20 years old then.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also plays basketball for LSU.
The average point is 5.6 and goes up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "disappeared" and "surprised" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
A volcano smashes ashes in Mexico City
Abu coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern corner of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after activity increased in the crust and registered there were 183 gas and ashes in more than 24 hours.
The center watched several times the excitement and the vibes.
The images on social media show a thin layer of gray attached to the front glass of the car around Mexico City.
Geophysicians have recorded increased activity in a volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital city since the 7.1 earthquake shook Mexico in mid-September 2017.
This volcano is known as the "Don Goyo" that has been active since 1994.
The police clash with the Catalan separatist near the election of freedom.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-freedom demonstration contest with the anti-houra police, and when thousands joined the rival demonstration to mark the first Catalonian polling event on self-settlement.
A group of masked pro-separatists arrested by the anti-huru hara police threw them with eggs and threw powder paints, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
Disputes also took place after that day with the police using their wands to control the fight.
For several hours the groups of pro-freedom shouted "Don't forget, no forgiveness" faced with the demand for the workers' union shouting, "Spanish Life."
Twelve people received treatment for the minor injury obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
The tension remained high in this free - oriented region, a year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters prefer to be free, even though the low number of voters with those who oppose separation and most of them boycott the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police were trying to stop the vote at the GST throughout the area in a sharp confrontation.
Pro-free groups have been camping all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstration continued but forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we went through one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for choice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although it won a vital victory even a little in the regional election last December, the pro-freedom parties Catalan has fought to preserve this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in detention or in custody awaiting trial, on their role in organizing referendums and on the next declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded a protest with her phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he was going to vote for the European Parliament next year.
"Having as a candidate for European elections is the best way to undermine poverty in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The gol printed by Menga has given victory to Livingston over Rangers with a 1-0 score
The first gol Dolly Menga for Livingston sure of victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of the Iberox Club, on both defeats in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga attacks have been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equal to the Hibernate in the second order.
The side of Gerrard remains unbeatable in this season's Premiership and confronts the head of hearts with eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers had met Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, extended their invincible record in the division to six matches, while Coach Holt's head has been beating since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a sloppy guest team.
Holt's team was supposed to be superimposed long before they scored the goal, with their commitment that gave Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson was able to break through but his effort was to miss across the gauntlet, and then Alan Lithgow was able to slow down his efforts only after he slipped in and faced with Craig Halkett's call from across the gallows.
The host feels satisfied to let Rangers play great at the beginning, knowing that they can make it difficult for the arrival team to happen dead balls.
And that's a way to achieve a very important goal.
Rangers broke free kicks and Livingston got the chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored goals from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers have dominated the rule but realizes that the host's defense cannot be blocked and Liam Kelly's murder is entirely unconcerned,
The pattern went on until the second round, although Alfredo Morelos managed to catch Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was swept away by the foot guard Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's lost far because of the other Livingston tactics.
The attack continued to come to the Livingston gawg and continuously mounted, while two criminal claims - after the Halkett challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball - rejected.
Phenomenal of Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they're amazing, they're going beyond hope on this ever-increasing road.
The play style and their staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top board, but the big credit must be given to Holt on the way he has strengthened the team since he came.
He has so many champs.
Captain Halkett was very big, leading well organized defenses, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were keeping watch during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet the standard.
Their last ball was less good - only one time they could break the formation on the side of the host - and it was a warning to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan witnessed uniforms in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky fight on Saturday (September 29th) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They're arguing about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a new great mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police reported on security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protests - many of them Kurds - also sound, threaten both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome them in that country.
The resistance protest describes a conflict over the existence of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some German Turkish people and persecuted as a dictator by others.
Deptford highway crash: Drivers killed in car crash
A bike driver died in a crash involving a car in London.
Crashes are taking place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver has stopped and the paramedics have come, but the guy died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after the other bikers died in a runaway crash at Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officers were trying to identify the man and report to his family.
The road was closed and bus routes were diverted and motorists were taken to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in the hurdles
Six wardens suffered injuries in a man's prison with strict guard, the lapa's office stated.
The chaos in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sundays is still ongoing.
"Tornado" specialist officer has been assigned to deal with the waste, which involves eight prisoners and happens on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Spare officers who have been specially trained have been assigned to deal with incidents that are happening in the Long Lartin HMP prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some most dangerous inmates.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after an inmate attacked him.
And in October yesterday, anti-huru-hara officers were called to prison to deal with serious expenses where a lapa officer was attacked with a bile ball.
Rosa Storm Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Banang Flood.
The tropical depression that strikes Arizona rarely occurs, but that's what's likely to happen next week because of traces of Rosa's storm's energy left through the southwest desert, creates a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona to South Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was estimated to be headed straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentions on Twitter that there is only "ten tropical tops capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status in 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles of AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center Tools can predict 2 to 4 inches of dry rain with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Another area of southwest deserts, including the Rockies and Great Basin, is likely to be hit from 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of an isolation rate of up to 4 inches.
For those in the flood - free area, Rosa’s rain may have been a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood was a serious problem, some of these rain raids are likely to be beneficial because the western region is now in the grip of drought.
According to the U.S. United States drought guard, only about 40 percent of Arizona's area has experienced some extreme drought, the second-highest category," reportsweather.com.
First, the route through the Rosa Storm leads to land across the California Bay of Mexico’s birthplace.
Rosa, still in storm power on Sunday morning at wind speeds 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm came across a colder water area in the Pacific, and that's why it's weakened.
Therefore, it is estimated that it will land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday evening or evening.
It may be high in parts of Mexico, causing high flood risks
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of dry rain is estimated to swept through the Baja California region to the southwest of Sonora, probably up to 10 inches," reportsweather.com.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of all of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will cross Arizona and South Utah on the middle of the night.
"The main risk that Rosa's storm might have or the rest of it is very high rainfall in Baja California, sonora's northwest region, and the U.S. western U.S. desert region." National Storm Center (NHC) stated.
It is estimated that it will cause flood and debris to flow into the deserts, and that there will be lands in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Arrest of four murder suspects
Three teenage men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a heel wound in Somerset.
These boys were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
One 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds and one 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, said the police.
Officers have sent anyone who might have the video footage of those events on his cell phone to come and report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘received hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the cruel and shameful Democratic Party," said Trump on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democrat Party during the scorching process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual violence to him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reinforce someone who has the most perfect legal thinking in our time, a jury with record marks of true public servants," he said to the West Virginia supporters crowd.
The President implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appeal when discussing the importance of the participation of the republics in the election.
"Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really kidding," he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "block and block."
The first-degree voter procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's appeal is expected to be carried out at the latest on Friday, an assistant senior GOP senior leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami, with an increasing number of casualties.
A few 384 people died, many lingering as the giant waves hit the shore, when the massive earthquake and tsunami spread across the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when a six - foot (18 feet) wave destroyed the beach at dusk, causing a lot of death and destroying whatever it passed.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run so quickly that they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Disaster Relief Board (BNPB) said at the moment of tacitism in Jakarta.
"The Tsunamis didn't come alone, he dragged the car, the wood, the house, laying everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed out at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people evacuated to 24 centers of service in Palu.
The air photos produced by BNPB show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges and ambers and a mosque surrounded by water.
An earthquake swept through the city along the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake break is felt in 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Research and Technological Training Body (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted on the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb force released in Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the tip of a long narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that has occurred as "extensive" and states that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The body of some victims was found trapped under the ruined ruins of the building, he said, adding that there were 540 victims of injuries and 29 people who were missing.
Nugroho says that victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "is really paralyzed with no information from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading to the region affected by the disaster.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be worse," he said.
The forum was linked on Saturday to many criticisms for not reporting that there was an open tsunami, although the authorities said that the wave was spread at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur tape shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building sounding a warning with panic of approaching tsunamis, towards the people on the street below.
In a minute's roll of water to the shore, removes buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of the electrical combustion of communication around the Palu, thus making it difficult for authorities to coordinate their efforts to save.
The military has already begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The Air City has been reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center at the Palu on Sunday.
The victim of Tsunami Indonesia is increasing above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Donggala made it to safety in Palu City, where they protected them in the finest tent built on their office page, on their way they had passed through a variety of grassy areas, said Father Dosebah.
"They tell me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's so terrible.
Even when the relief group began to move slowly to initiate disaster relief activities, some of the groups complained about the supply of skilled foreign volunteers to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, foreign aid, goods and energy can only begin to be paid if an area has been officially identified as a national disaster region.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Auli Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time of the government's saying, OK, this is a national disaster," we could have received international assistance, but there is no such status."
On the second night of the past, earthquakes and tsunamis occurred in Palu, friends and family of the lost victims still hoped that those whom they loved would be part of the miracle that would repair the course of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was expelled from the glass.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who had been trapped under a cliff for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national paralytic team coach, has been a coach for two lost paralytic athletes, who were able to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still trapped at Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of paralas, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told me again how after the news about the broken Roa-Roa Hotel goes around the paragliding community, in despair he sent whatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who also participated in the beach festival.
Even so, all the messages, get just one sign of gray, instead of a two-coloured blue.
"I think that means a message not sent," he said.
The robber took $26,750 during the ATM loading at Newport in Levee

The driver has cleared an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was at work, another man was "walking from behind Brink's workers" and stole a bag of money that was going to be sent.
Witnesses saw some suspects escape from the scene, based on the news, but the police did not mention the number involved.
Whoever has information about their identity can call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
That rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announced that change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has already been named Ye for some time and has used that name as his eighth album, released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform at the show, which was cancelled because of the "emotional reason," said the creator of the show.
As a abbreviation for his professional name at this time, West had previously said that it had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with Big Boy's publisher.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only the only one, to be Ye - as a mirror of our goodness, our worst, our confusion, everything.
It's more of a mirror of our true self."
He's one of the rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announces his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former West Collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a link sign and big letters.
President Mexico, AMLO, swearing not to use the military in dealing with civil society
The President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military power against the civilian community to warn the 50th year of the bloody revenge against the student.
Lopez Obrador promised the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to suppress the Mexicans."
The army fired fire on peaceful demonstration activities in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the left wing students moved their roots across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are studying and opening up more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encouraged young people to form a criminal gang.
The A.S. was supposed to double the A.I.s.
Since China is more active in the matter of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase the amount of funds that will be used for research in the field, investor words and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. overall lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China outlined its plan last year: its purpose is to become the number one in the 2030 AI innovation.
"Representing the AI research fund is a good start, considering all other countries tend to remain far away from the U.S., and we're looking for further breakthroughs in the AI field," says Lee.
Reducing funds can double the chance that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that beats the best American Othello player, and then he became an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google the Chinese branch.
Lee admitted to the competition of U.S. government technology earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the New Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the government's prize, says Lee.
"That's not China's leader; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the characters from universities to study AI for the past few years.
Lee says that immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to support AI's overall efforts.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD holders in the AI field," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued the next generation's Smart Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions just like the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic duties in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White House announces the Selection Committee's formation.
And this month, the DARPA (Future Defense Research Agency) announces a $2 billion investment in an initiative called the Next AI.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that asked him to set up the National Security Commission for Real Intelligence did not see any further action for months.
The Macedonians made a vote in order to change the country's name
The Macedonians made a vote on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia," an action that would resolve a decade of conflict with the Greeks who had denied their membership to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains its view that the name of the neighbouring country to the north represents a recognition of ownership of its region and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of a new name, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most Slavia Macedonian ethnic populations.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign had raised doubts whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the vote required for the election to be declared legitimate.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of name change, including Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price to be paid in order to get permission to enter the body like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born out of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament say they will obey the vote to make decisions.
Change of name requires voice abuse of two by three in parliament.
The National Election Commission said no reports of violations until 1:00 p.m.
However, it turned out that the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last election of the parliament in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters registered gave their vote.
"I came to give my voice to my children, where we were in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter at the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, gave their voice for public elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strimica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54 years old, has already prepared a small stage and pulls seats in front of the tents that they are going to set up that voter.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join honorably, not through the maid's door," said Cavavarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which had more than 20 percent unemployment levels.
"I believe that most people will agree with it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his voice.
He said "yes" will be "confirmed our future."
An opinion sheet published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday yesterday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than the number needed.
Another line of thought, which was held by Telma Macedonia TV stations, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
In order to make it a success, it takes 50 percent plus 1 voice.
A failure in voting will represent the first rejection of policy against the pro-Barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explores the entire Brighton defense to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were handed over as Brighton's defense of Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that victory look very easy on his score in the minute to 65.
The Argentine attackers received an operand in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three people defending Brighton before he broke into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-shaped people.
He turned over one man to defend before running ahead of a few others at the end of the Brighton line.
Then he ran to his left, to Sterling.
The British front blinds used their first kick from the gauntlet to tap the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's killer, Mathew Ryan with a kick on the right side of the gallows.
"Aguero struggles with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola Manager City to the reporter.
"We talked about her playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling's the one who's giving Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
That gol happened at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far into Brighton's territory at that game.
He's operating the ball with a far kick that blows through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little kicking the ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.

Scherzer wants to draw spoiler versus Rockies
With the elimination of Nationals from the playoff game, there's no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer's too competitive hopes to be able to take over Colorado Rockies on the game on Sunday, but only if there's still playoff implications for Rockies, the top of one Los Angeles Dodgers match in the NL West.
At least the Rockies haven't got a place after winning in the wild-card game against the Nationals by score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division degree.
"Even if we play without winning, at least we can see the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd of viewers and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I may face this year.
How come I don't want to compete in a game like that?"
Nationals haven't announced the opening game for Sunday, but reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer participate.
Scherzer, who is going to start a lag for 34 times, has a Sunday training session and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to get some rest.
Pitcher's right-hand Washington is an 18-7 scorer with an average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump's campaigning in West Virginia.
The President narrowly refers to the situation involving the potential High Court Judge's choice, Brett Kavanaugh, as he talks about the importance of the voice of the republic in the middle of elections.
"All the efforts we've been making are at stake in November.
Five weeks before it was carried out, it was the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see a lot of radical Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see the evils, their oppression.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should be able to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrat, he said, was on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you saw it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bitter and evil and unbelief and unbelief."
He referred to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Court Committee of the Senate, by mentioning his name, which was received with a loud resounding ossuence from his listeners.
"What's the answer?
Are you leaking those documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for him -- it's a very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work Force Party is no longer a place for public service.
Now be intolerant to anyone who puts his mind to the fore
When Momentum's activist at the local party gave me a voice to threaten me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I was in the final order of Parliament’s Members, who were told that our presence was not expected — all because we expressed our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she defended anti-Semitism vigorously.
In my case, the anger movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, the issue that is ironically the same as that challenged by Jeremy Corbyn with the previous leader.
Notice for the Nottingham workers meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, a meeting of the General Committee on Friday evenings just like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about politics that are "better, more friendly" is not long forgotten, if, indeed, it has begun.
Differences in the labor party’s views are becoming more apparent and are not tolerated and each opinion is judged by the party’s authority.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I thought would share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and take a position that I would never have received - either in national security or in the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then after that I will be followed by a search on the social media that asks for a cancellation of the show, reproaching central politics, told me I shouldn’t be in the labor party.
And it's not just me who's going through it.
Of course, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because of comments that I'm referring to tending to politics.
I admired the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who faced daily sexual harassment or racism but never missed out.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party was supposed to help develop the culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we're no longer in a broader church and with every motion "insubstantiating" or changing the selection of party rules to become more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that drove me to keep my head down, not too loud, and then I'm gonna say "good."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the completion of the Thatcher government, which led to my literally collapsed comprehensive school, I have tried to fight better public service for those who really needed it - both as local counselors and government ministers.
I never hid my political actions, including my last election.
No one in the East Nottingham will question my policy position and things I don't agree with today's leadership.
For those who encourage the motion on Friday, what I can say is that when the country moves fast towards the ruling division (Brexit), it will endanger our country's business and our public service, I don't want to waste time and energy to be loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of withdrawal or any political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is of the best interest to you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr upst
The last two experiments may have been a bit misleading the end result, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they're in the top order, the only undefeated side of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to achieve the best possible opportunity, made the host team and coach Peter Murchie have the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeatable so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The prize for Ayr, they are better at taking the opportunity than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but yellow card to captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given to the game by Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to print numbers and Jason Baggot stole undiverse experiments.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored goals and then did a single experiment to make the Ayr score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was changed by Baggot, reduced the opportunity to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound, being sent out, and since the start of the game, Ayr went faster than Stafford McDowall's experiment, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of hard pressure.
The host has come back to play, but, at the time when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he was climactic without a ball, from the penal line, MacPherson arrived behind the wounded Ayr advanced.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a kick-off and thwarted the fifth effort of the operator Gregor Henry.
Star Still Game looks ready to go through his new career in the restaurant industry
The Star Still Game Kieran is ready to move to the service industry after it was known that he was appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56-year-old at the BBC's popular event, was guided and starred with an old comedian, Greg Hemphilll.
The couple have already announced that the 9th series that's coming is the last episode, and Kiernan has planned to drive live after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's Director Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun source claimed that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "growing restaurant industry in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrolled the main base of the army in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Marine Camp from Titicaca to Amazon was demolished by motorcycles: "The sea is our rightful right.
To rise again is a duty."
Through Bolivia, surrounded by land, a memory of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict is still clear as the desire for once again to fight the Pacific Ocean.
Hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, for Bolivia is waiting for a court ruling on October 1 after a five - year trial.
"Bolivia has moments, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ trial on a wide-screen throughout the country, hoping that the courts in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s demands that - after several decades of strengthening talks - Chile is required to negotiate Bolivia’s guarantee of sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's first-born president, who is in the middle of a controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support for Monday's trial.
"We've been very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes-- and it's only going to change a little if it's possible.
The United Nations does not have the power to surrender Chile, and it has already established that it will not decide on the outcome of the dispute.
That the ICJ decree came only six months after the final argument that had been heard, which indicated the case "not complex," said Paz Zárate, an international Chilean law expert.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years, it's probably just going through a fallout.
"The problem of access to the sea has been plowed by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good iktika of the remaining Chileans, he says.
Bolivia and Chile would remain at a certain point, but it would be very difficult to keep up with the discussion after this.
In 1962, the two countries did not exchange large ambassadors.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government representative of Den Haag, rejected the idea of making decisions quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-plus one of the most famous Latin American presidents-used maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea said nuclear weapons won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Foreign Minister North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never be disarming nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States was carrying out the deal made at a meeting in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments came up when Secretary of State A.S. Mike Pompeo saw almost starting nuclear diplomacy that had been dead for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says just one "your dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the Korean War settlement declaration will make North Korea surrender.
Washington is in a hurry to approve that declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to stop the armed forces first.
Well, Kim and President A.S. Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is some doubt that Pyongyang is committed to the recognition of the weapons warehouse that the country is the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris's fashion show shows a lot of new collections covering your head up to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the hat collection or really want to be protected from sunlight, don't look for the others.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers released a series of large head coverings for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage with a stunning style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have swept Instagram in this summer and these designers have been watching creations that are eye-catching on the stage.
The outstanding thing about Valentino is a cream - colored hat that is embellished with the wide edge of the hair that covers the model’s head.
Large-sized accessories include a diamond-enriched assortment, witch hat, and even a pineapple, but not designed to warm up the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange mask-and right around Halloween.
Many colored masks whose lips have been lined up and like Hannibal Lecter compared to high seams.
A creature that looks like a scuba dive suit is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while the other one looks like a melted ice cream.
And if you keep going through the collection of these news - then you're happy.
The mode observers estimate that the large hat collection will be spread to the main road near you.
Large hats become a very large train in the ‘La Bomba’, straw hat with a two-legged edge is worn all people including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a hat that is very impractically popping off the social media creates a great creation on the beach quarries of the vast straw almost the same as the swimwear - used with a simple model.
Flavor bags burned, cut with raffia on the edge with white straps, are outstanding from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
The hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I wish to see a large hat and a beach bag arrived on the main road for the summer - because the designer has made a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the request for the big accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland's private school keeps track of academic excellence, and this is continued in 2018 with extraordinary testing, which is reinforced by each student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School Council (SIS), are working hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the curriculum as expected, we see that modern language continues to be a popular and desirable choice lesson in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, your words will come into his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your words will come into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test results of this year, we can see that the language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation value in the independent school.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign language get A Plus.
The data, gathered from 74 SCIS schools that show that 72 percent of students gain A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also gain A.
This indicates that schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will be required by children and adolescents in the future.
At present, languages, as a choice of study subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM (scientists, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Labour and Skills Service in 2014 found that for some reasons why the workers had to keep struggling to fill the gap, 17 percent why language skills were lacking.
Hence, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their careers in the coming days.
As more and more opportunities for speaking become available, this quality is needed in the global world.
Whatever career choices a person may have, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will feel real benefits because of having the abilities of this kind of life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically create a superior multilingual in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov on more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign language well enough to have spoken and French became the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for children now is an important thing for the moment.
Having multilingual skills, especially in developing countries with economies, will divide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in England for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in the independent school, with the teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland's independent school is designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and divide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be ruled out that at present, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language must truly be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer the choice, the skills, and the excellence of this for Scottish teenagers.
We have to do this.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish School Council.
LeBron will be standing for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of fans to see LeBron James is holding his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Lacers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of the spring pier on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, he hasn't determined how many minutes he's going to play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the initial training this week, James was asked about his plan for the six - hour Lakers ’ class.
"At my career stage right now, I don't have to do the pre-season game to prepare," he said.
General Trump Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a general campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first Trump general meeting of five general meetings scheduled next week, including a stop in some pleasant places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After asserting that the vote was postponed so that he could choose to occupy the Supreme Court, Trump intended to build support for him for the long-term public election because the Republican Party risked losing Congress control if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia was scheduled at 7:00 p.m. E.T. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s public meeting in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's congregation for the Second Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is becoming more tense after accusations of insanctious sexual behavior and estimates of the vote of the Senate will be postponed until a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this public conference agenda is to help the Republicans to get a few moments in facing the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it is mentioned that five general meetings next week are intended to "invigorate volunteers and supporters because the Republican parties are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," says Reuters.
"Congress control is very important for its agenda so as the president may travel to the states as long as we face the busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman who refuses to mention his name addressed to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's general meeting is expected to provide support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a Western Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was left behind in the polls.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an effort to improve his winnings in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team muster up courage to stand up to the single game on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome session Saturday afternoon is perhaps needed in this Ryder Cup.
The momentary bandule is a sport concept that is the result of a full-fledged discovery by the players, and nothing is more than a competition like this.
Where do they think the moment is right now?
"Before they were six points high and now four, so I think we considered it a little bit short," Jordan Spieth said as it passed that day.
Of course Europe has the advantage of having four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, like Spieth said, felt they had a little moment and they had a lot of things that could be exciting, except for the Spieth and Justin Thomas formation that played together all day and each prided three out of four points.
Spieth has been playing in a lethal way from the tee area to the green area and leading with modesty.
Crying that parachute celebrity is getting harder when his turn comes, doing a big big punch to make a big game when he and Thomas lose two opponents.
The punctuation of him who won them at the number 15 received with a similar shout, which told you that he was sure America did not lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes need to be marked.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days ago was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unstoppable story from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't do a bogey blow on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this delicate crowd that convinces them that they are players to be defeated on Sundays, and no player is more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will seal Europe's potential victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It would be better if both were placed in a different hole at the same time.
Still too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut off Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball in the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front like digging holes that will never be beaten by Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to look closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change immediately.
Thus far, Europe plays better as a team and leads far enough towards the final day, but also shows that the U.S. team has the guts to compete in spite of some doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe top 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit on the final day of Ryder Cup after rising from the fourball and foursome Saturday games by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Two inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the trophies that couldn't be found in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the early fourball, made this series 3-1.
The United States is giving more resistance to foursomes, winning two games, but they can't reduce deficits.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of 12 single matches Sunday to maintain trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were called "Melliwood" after the end of the sensational weekend, only became the second couple who won four points of their four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they became very strong to defeat the steeped Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau with greater force 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturday, once a brilliant performance, but he's lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven rounds.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returning to partner with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world rankings.
Europe doesn't reach it by itself even though days are fun and winding in the southwest of Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for America on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win that was interesting over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two hole.
It's just twice the history of Ryder Cup where a team returns from the four-point deficit into a single game, even though as champions survive the Furyk team just need a series point to maintain trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, the Sunday’s return attack seems to be beyond them.
North Korea said 'no way' it's gonna take off a weapon on its side without any trust.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea delivered to the United Nations a report on the continuing punishment of their disbelief in the United States and it was impossible for the country to disarm its nuclear weapons on a one-sided basis in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Council of the world's annual body that North Korea has taken "significant steps that show good intentions" last year, like stopping nuclear tests and missiles, unlocking nuclear testing sites, and promises not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without the trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is impossible for us to disarm our own weapons first in person."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance on a "prominent" approach to decriminalization where North Korea will be punished for taking a step forward, a statement indicated that they did not completely reject what Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to the joint statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made at the summit between the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea this first time in Singapore on 12 June, at that time Kim promised to pursue a "enrichment of the Korean summit" while Trump pledged security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53 officially, but the United States says that Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call to extend international heavy sanctions in North Korea.
"United States insists on "priorly recruitment" and increases pressure with the provision of semi-sanctions to achieve their purpose by force, and even rejects "the final statement of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that constantly punishment will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which was sponsored by the U.S. leaders at the United Nations Union earlier this week.
The minister also highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leaders Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the problem party in this deuklisation is South Korea and not the United States, the Korean-like deukrisation will not reach this kind of winding road."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech tone was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the U.N. General Court that targeting North Korea rockets on the U.S. land was something that could not be avoided after "Mr. Devil President" Trump called Kim "manusia rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump who last year threatened to "break up" North Korea totally, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but the great work still had to be done and sanctions had to be done until North Korea took a decriminalization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--no problem," he said.
Tiongkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo delivered a statement to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Derogation of Security Council sanctions must be continued firmly and must not fail until we know that full, final and verified decrimination."
The Security Council with a round voice has been increasing sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an effort to stop the delivery of nuclear programs and Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the ranks of the General Council of the United Nations and then said that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only North Korea in a haunted hour count that he made "a charge like a gangster."
North Korea promises at a meeting with Moon this month to unlock the missile location and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He said that Kim told him to do "the right thing" with his wish is security assurance that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course about a good break.
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is developing through the 'manufactured ghost' with caffeine.
An academic discovers that students at university number one world often know nothing if they discuss very basic things about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medical specialist at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed courses, which he believed were the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start a course after giving lectures on the effects of sleeplessness during the study.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why have I just been told, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping -- which shocked me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course first launched this year, explains to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help academics and athletes, and improve their public well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a very sleepless student all week.
The one - hour course involved an interactive series of tasks.
In one session there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books for an explanation of the effect of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic results are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
On the other hand, participants were told how long sleep shortages could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with interactive icons, then pushes the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes in health,' beloved Prof. Czeisler.
The culture is proud of 'blows', he says, added that modern technology and pressure that continues to rise in students who mean lack of sleep are ever-growing problems.
Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, his advice - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activating the mode of hunger, creating a steady hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the entire college.
The next step, he hoped that the entire graduate student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider adjusting the alarm's sleep time, also wake-up alarms, and realize the effects of the 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can move your sirkadian rhythm out of its set line, thus causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga lowered the mind of the Gerrard army
Again, Rangers felt the sadness of the day when Dolly's attack drove Steven Gerrard's scattered team to 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Aberox team has been trying to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
Attack seven minutes before the first round is over and Rangers who are out of touch do not seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to the sixth position, Livingston rises to the third position, leaving only a single goal of Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in the Rangerskumbu after Calum Spence's guard had to be treated for head injuries after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that copied Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with a costume that haunted their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston exploits the ball that they have better.
They were supposed to have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor, but the boar pulled the big chance too wide.
Jacobs' free kicks in and out met Captain Craig Halkett but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow can only stab wide in the back.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than any belief in their third game.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless crashed at a quarter-hour mark, but Steven Thomson's Drought refused this Colombian citizen.
Rangers only managed to do two shots in the first round but the former Iberox warden, Liam Kelly, had almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headband and easy-to-use Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goals in the 34th minute may stand in the way of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep death tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm chose for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted at a break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost gave a direct influence when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly was playing impressively out of line to kick off.
But Livingston kept forcing a team of hunters to play exactly what they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to spread their excellence at the end stage but McGregor stood up well to drive Jacobs away before Lithgow swung wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacements, Glenn Middleton, claim punishment again when he's arguing with Jacobs, but again Thomson turns his face.
Almanac: Geiger Speller
And now from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and MAJESTY WILL BE AWARE... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed methods to detect and measure radioactivity, it was a discovery that eventually created the device called the Geiger Speller.
As a scientific tool since then, Geiger's Spell has also become a pop culture link, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starred by seemingly less convincing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What kind of thing is that?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Scratch, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by radioactivity in mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be happening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But that discovery kept her name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘know’ bad cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccination teaches immune systems to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, turning them into a lab.
They can then 'know' a common protein in many cancers and then re-supply them.
A test vaccine shows promising results on patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which is to teach the immune system to recognize the bad cell, her ovarian cancer has been missing for over 18 months.
This method involves the extraction of the patient's immune cells, transforming them into the laboratory so that they can "get" the protein that is usually present in many cancers called HER2, and then reinvent the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "It is true that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "pulse growth of various types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and cholorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them the way to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts Diatribe Pro-Trump, wears the MAGA hat, after its SNL look.
Not Walking Good
Kanye West went to the studio during the Saturday Night Live after a messy performance where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he was going to vote in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democrat party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a charade starred by Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicious Committee on the claim of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West crickets were released to social media by the Chris Rock comedy.
It's not clear whether Rock is trying to make fun of the West with that upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the stage because of the hat that was worn.
"They sheltered me behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat.'
They're blocking me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on: "Do you want to see where it's going to sink?" said that he's going to wear Superman's robe, because this means you can't dictate what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments produce at least twice a lecture from the viewers and SNL's voice sounds ashamed, Variety reports, with one person telling us, "The whole studio's still."
West was taken in the last few moments as a substitute for Ariana Grande's singer, former rapist girlfriend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West is confusing a lot of people with the performance of I Love it, dressed like Perrier's Bottle.
West has the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote tweets: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for your patience."
But the host of Karen Hunter's show wrote tweets that the West is just "being itself and it's really great."
"But I chose for NOT to provide someone (buying his or her clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe to be wobbling and undermining the ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "an official creature known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly lived up to Prince's music legend, turned his name into a symbol and then an artist once known as Prince.

Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the mid-century fantasy series of violent HBO Game of Thrones.
However, this actor, 31, holding out the stereotype of macho hero, said that the role on the screen like that made young boys often feel that they had to be strong to be honored.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that he believes there's something wrong and questions how to deal with bad masculinity issues in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who had just married his opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, pretty strong, right now--where is our fault in this masculinity thing?' she said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, related to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of a bad masculinity with its very masculine characters.
He goes on to say, 'Where is the character born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think that's really one of the big questions of this time-- how do we change it?
'Cause obviously there's something wrong with the young people.'
In that interview he also admitted that he wouldn't play in a prekuel or a sequence Game of Thrones when this show would end next summer, saying that he'd been 'finished with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will star back in True West of Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me family the future, and from here my life began' her word.
Rose played Ygritte, the character love flower Kit is Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
This couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family’s land in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Tiongkok reports 14% of the new cases
Tiongkok has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the new cases were transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through several parts of Tyeongkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, the Tyeongkok health officer said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of those who live with HIV and AIDS in Tiongkok has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of Tyeongkok.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tyeongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was called increasing.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of disease are derived from unsurpassed sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters contends that the staff has leaked data from Senator GOP, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
The president of Maxine Waters on Saturday contends that one of his staff has sent personal information to three senators of the United States Republic Party to the Wikipedia parliamentary member page.
The Los Angeles Democrat Party asserts that the claim is being moved by experts and the ultra-right wing website.
"Talk, lie, and many other foul lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Reportedly, the information released includes the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by unknown people in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel session on sexual charges against potential Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses that identify the source of shipment are connected to the Waters office and disclose information to one of the Waters staff members, Hill reports.
"This accusation is not based on the truth and is an absolute lie," goes on Waters.
"My staff--which identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by lying and misbehavior charges--no responsibility for this leak of information.
This is a false accusation.
Waters’ statement quickly draws online criticism, including from former Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This curse means anger," writes Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be Congressman.
If a person says otherwise, he should not be quick to take offense.
They must not deviate.
They can't question the bully's motive.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican party candidate who is trying to move Waters on the part-time election, also conveys his thoughts on Twitter.
"Bear if true," he writes on Twitter.
In his statement, Water says his office has warned "the right authority and the law enforcement authority about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrator will be revealed," he continued, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions to one and all my staff members."
Johnny's English Strikes Again - poor atkinson Rowan spy parody
It is currently looking for Brexit's significance in every new film with English biased views already become a tradition and it seems to occur for the resurgence of Johnny English's larynx-colonetic parodium - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the syndicate sarcasm of how clearly we become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, who was looking at rubber, rubber - faced, and uncompetent, has updated his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name has shown more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for English - speaking realms.
Of course he's a crazy secret agent who, beyond his strange suspicion, has a little character Clouseau, a small character Mr. Bean and a wandering cousin who donated a little note to the theme Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
In fact, he was based on international mystery tourists and men who had been played at Atkinson at the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the mess behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on the new JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English approaches the helicopter by wearing middle - century diapers and rotor ballings quickly sticking in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a physical comedy is shown, but his humor is less powerful and too strange, especially when making a "serious" movie like 007 and Mission Impossible had to believe in putting a comedian as a material.
His humor felt as if it were meant for children rather than adults, and for me, the strange, uninnovative Johnny English, and as the focus of Atkinson' movies' jokes in Bean's personality.
The award that has been warming up for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint an agent who's on duty - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the arrogant and hostile minister, who has completely destroyed his popularity politically: Emma Thompson played very well with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much can be taken from his script.
His clever advisor provides information that because every active spy has been crushed, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means Johnny's cricket himself, now being hired as the principal in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to perform a cover-up operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers spy academy like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and joined again with a long-suffering old friend named Bough, whom Ben Miller repeatedly witnessed.
Bough is now married, wifeing a submarine commander, top-class role that sucks where Vicki Pepperdine is a little out of sight.
So Batman and Robin who made the mistake of His Majesty's Secret Agent re-acting, met the mysterious beautiful woman Ofelia Bulletova, whom Olga Kurylenko taught.
Meanwhile, the minister was worried about falling into the influence of the charismatic technology that claimed to solve the problem of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their ridiculous adventures: disguised as servants, they burned up a fast French restaurant; they made chaos by smuggled themselves into Volta's luxury boat; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use the Virtual Reality headset to get used to the inside of Volta's house.
All stoppings must be pulled for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and caress, there's a little children's TV channel that's all about it.
It's pretty moderate.
And like the Johnny English film, I can't not think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
Workers are planning plans for British citizens to work four days a week but are paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Union considered the radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The union was reported to want the company owners to continue the results of the bombing through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional days off.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend three days-- but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea is going to 'pass' with the party economic agenda and plans push the country to support the workers.
Four - day week shift has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way of making workers feel the benefits of economic change.
One source, senior of the Labour Union, said to The Sunday Times: 'The focus on this policy is expected to be announced by the end of this year.
'This won't happen overnight, but four days work a week is an aspiration appropriate to the party's approach to balance the economy that supports workers and the entire industrial party strategy.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as Green Party had promised four days of work in a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
Speakers of the Labour Party say: 'Four working days in a week are not party policy and are not being considered by the parties.'
John McDonnell's Shadow Chancellor used the Labour Conference last week to perfect his vision for the social revolution in economics.
McDonnell says he's determined to take back power from the anonymous director and the cathutian at the utility company.
This shadow cancer plan also means that current stockholders in the drinking water company may not get back all their shares because the government of the Labour Party can do 'refund' with the reason for the infringements felt.
He also made sure his plan to put the workers in the company's board and create the Inclusive Property Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to the employees, which would cover the annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the impeachment of himself in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions as to whether this office's findings could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview shown on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Senator of the Republic Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find anything that could change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, determined, firm man."
However, Graham seems to be unable to change his sound.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is that Brett strongly disputes him," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name cannot verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does the Global Citizen Festival mean, and has this event done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will be holding the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that showcases an impressive display of stars, and a mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will be witnesses to tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this event that is actually ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay VIP tickets), a concert visitor must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing the world's leaders, calling, or other ways that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert is the right way to ask people to do something, or is it just another case called "clickivism" -- people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, spurs to set another goal.
It is said that this action has helped trigger world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of them have been mentioned or made fundraisers.
This group's estimated safe funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some major commitments among others, The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership consisting of investors and performers who commit to "help children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end the lack of nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, the ambassadors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of this lack of nutrition into the record of history," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd of people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in Question General Answers on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen said: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheids that exist before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars featured on this year's New York show, which will be led by the Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary in the Land
"If necessary" Washington can request the Navy's assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zinke's statement, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke insists that Russia’s involvement in Syria - especially, where he operates on a legitimate government invitation - is a trade to explore the new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy bluffs, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reports.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure the open sea lanes, and, if necessary, to do the blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the event participants held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits who called himself "the voice of energy customers" in the U.S.
He compares Washington's approaches to a deal with Russia and Iran, see that in terms of effectiveness, they are the same.
"Economy in Iran and Russia is much more, exploiting and exchanging fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with the economy that relies on fossil fuel.
This statement appears when Trump's government representatives are doing a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replace Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, endeavored to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "unsuitable" oil pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "container" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream oil mill project worth $11 billion, which is designed to enhance the capacity of the oil mill that is up to 110 billion cubic metres of oil, is a real economic project.
Kremlin contends that Washington's hard resistance to this project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy can't be used to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," said Russian Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This American attitude has attracted the reaction of Germany, which has reconfirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in European Union energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face big problems if the third country mix our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's "Concerning the Situation" when he called himself as President in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "check the situation" when he nominated himself as president after the mid-term election.
When campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren asserts he will consider himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, including putting women in the top position," he said to The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I will look into the situation when I resign as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he was campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "led this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's speaking in his criticism of Trump and the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren says "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, an opinion poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own constitutions did not want him to run for his own by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voter's "probably" in Massachusetts said the senator shouldn't be presumptuous, according to the opinion of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent of the people who support those scoldings.
That opinion showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's self-response, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of self-administered and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that are discussed in connection with the possibility of registering in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin on a Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of violence in the house on Monday night.
"What happened to my son, what he's going to do when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries to our soldiers," he said in front of the audience attending the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin calls his capture as a "face in the room" and tells of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little differently, they come back harder, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what they have given them, fellow soldiers and aircraft and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, plus with reports of domestic violence and possession of arms in the drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports challenges to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal challenge to new U.S. policies that reject asylum for victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and districts offered friends-of-the-court briefing on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seekers against the policy, NBC News reports.
Full name is Grace v. In the trial session filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a cruel gang member," had insulted him, but the U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors for Grace’s support describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as countries facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy is in the background with the decision of the Council compared to the Immigrant in 2014 that allows black immigrants to flee from domestic violence to lodge asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "has ignored the state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be determined on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibitions violate the principle," friend-of-the court said.
Further, the DA gave a brief opinion that the policy that refused to enter the U.S. economy, said that they'd probably be businessmen and "including the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered the immigration judge to no longer give asylum to victims who fled violence in the homes and gang violence.
"It is only available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in social groups, or certain political opinions," the Sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people are facing every day around the world.
A very sad rescue in the Palu because the victim doubled in time to race to find a survivor.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very refreshing," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, resting her baby who was holding a detachment in the refugee center of Palu that was destroyed.
"Every minute the ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is rare."
People look back at their destroyed homes, pick up stuff that's soaked up, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in the hospital, damage caused by a 7.5-strong earthquake, and it was very messed up.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder fracture, lay outside the Pale Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a powerful earthquake.
Her tears flowed when she told me again how she felt when the earthquake shook the five - floor hotel rooms where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"No chance of saving yourself.
I think I'm trapped in a wall crash," Haris told the Associated Press, he added his family were in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, then shut up.
I didn’t know how he and my son were.
May they be saved."
U.S. Ambassador accuses Tyeongkok of 'intimidating' with 'advertising advertising'
A week after Tingkok's official newspaper has a four-page commercial in an U.S. newspaper that refers to the advantage of U.S. trade remittances, the U.S. ambassador for Tingkok accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's pay supplement at Des Moines Registers - the most widespread papers in the state of Iowa - after accusing Tingkok of trying to get involved in the U.S. Congress election on Nov. 6, an accusation against Tiongkok.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. officials said to Reuters, was a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to suppress Tiongkok.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to put commercials to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are trapped in ever-increasing trade wars, which make them raise the level of import tariffs for each other.
Tiongkok's payoff rate at the beginning of the war was designed to hit exporters in the state like Iowa who supported the Trump Republic Party, says Tingkok and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to Tiongkok and former governor who led Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to Tiongkok, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "Now he's propagating the intimidation by running advertising on our own free media."
"In the course of its propaganda, the government of Tingkok took advantage of the tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the highly valued press in America with its pay ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the street newspaper trade booths here, in Beijing, you will find a barrier to different voices and will not see the true mirror of the different opinions that the Tiongkok people might have about the troubled economic route, considering the media is under the control of the Communist Party of Tingkok," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous media in Tiongkok refuses to offer to publish" his article, even though he didn't mention a newspaper.
Analysts Warned, Republican Party Avoids Women's Choices Towards the End-of-Time Disadvantaged Disaster.
Because prominent people in the Republican Party who stand up and stand up for the candidate Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in dealing with a number of charges of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a return attack, especially from women, on the upcoming mid-term election.
Emotions about this problem are very high, and most members of the Republic Party have been reported to show that they want to advance on the vote.
It cannot be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator's (R-Arizona) push Jeff Flake at the end of the minute to do the FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger on the electorate.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it on November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when the Republican Party called on the Justice Committee to continue to progress in the Kavanaugh stand out of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"Anthusism and the motivation of democracy will come out of the list," political analysts not party Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women's voice-blowers in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which explains in detail sexual harassment against himself by the candidate head of the Supreme Court, analysts advise that there will be a return attack that will follow if the Republican Party continues to push him forward with confirmation.
"It was a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republic Party, earlier last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the selection of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the backup bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priority, a group that helps to choose the Demokrat Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided on who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more choice for the last.
A new line of opinion that YouGov did shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe in or maybe believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said similar things about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating charges filed by Ford and one of the other bullies, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's candidate showed him his shame when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Meeting Planning to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Berners-Lee team, World Wide Web researcher, launched a startup that tried to match Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrupt is "the domain of the world."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "personal online data storage" or their own PODs.
This storage can include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this personal online data storage is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
At the company known as "personal knowledge through data."
The idea of setting up Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce's company, is that the company should provide resources, processes, and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
Currently, this company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-bought security platform, some of the staff developers that are contracted to work on projects, and volunteer community code makers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization application using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether they'd introduce or not a total change where all their business models really would be reversed in the night.

Bernard Vann: Warn the WW1 Victory Cross
The only scholar of the Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, remembered in her birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won a prize on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone struck by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a stone of "intelligent symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of achievement his grandfather won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "runs a very thick fog under a firing squad from a field weapon and machine."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with the "greatest courage" leading the front line before rushing to use the field gun alone and slowing down three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's actions are "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put up a bouquet of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "exceedingly pleased to play a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support of many."
MMA fans went all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been working all night to watch Bellator 206 who's full of shit just to refuse to watch the main event.
The charges from San Jose consisted of 13 battles, including six on the main card and were being displayed directly all night in England in Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face each other, the audience in England was stunned when the flood turned to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciative after they have labored until this special day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter describes a change in children's cartoon movies as "an annoying joke."
"This is a government rule, that at 6:00 a.m. the content is not suitable for presentation, so replaced with the children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they're going to fix their schedule by counting the audience in England in the future.
"In my opinion, if we think about replay, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But now there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, a lot of back-up texts and everything is uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We would only reduce five of the six battles - as we used to do - and we would try to avoid the overcrowding for fans, and we did it.
This is an unprofitable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lowly' about sexual issues
Tom Daley’s Olympic divers said he grew up with a low self - esteem because of his sexual problem - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize until he entered middle school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said, he talked about the rights of gays to provide "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent doesn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-standing event, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off because of illness.
He appeared as the ones who were excluded from Laverne's first program, and Daley said he felt "less compared" to everyone else growing up with him because "not something that can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, "To this day, the feeling is less than the other, and the different feeling has become a real thing that gives me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
These two Olympic medalists have become the leading LGBT champion and have used their appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
She said that she spoke because she felt lucky she could live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he fell in love with a man - film maker from the U.S. Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprising me."
Daley married an Oscar craftsman who was 20 years older than him last year, and said the age gap wasn't a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age" - he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very hard to find someone with the same age who experienced the same tangle.
This couple has become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "the whole prospect" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, everyone's around 'I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know, there's something bigger than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father can't accept that he's going to die, and one of the last things he asks is whether they've got tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wants to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him you won't sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't defeated," he said.
Next year Daley competes at the 2012 Olympics and wins the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've been dreaming of all my life--to dive in front of the crowd of people at the Olympics, there's no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspires his first song - Proud by Heather Small - that has joined him in his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him reindeer.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American pegolf Phil Mickelson will record on Sundays when he plays the 47 Ryder Cup game, but he has to change roles to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event to record the 12th record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the winner is five times divided the time between being a cheerleader and playing his game on that scale, hoping to fix what has been troubling him.
Never was the straightest golfer even when he was at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man did not fit to take a very strict course at Le Golf National, which regularly gave a long and harsh sentence for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the highly accurate British champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new Tommy Fleetwood arrival to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single matches with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expressed his confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He fully understands his role today, claps my back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine he's playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's how it plays, and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most popular Ryder Cup game played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven times the series, even though Furyk said that his presence brought some things he couldn't say on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's hot, he's laughing at people, and he's the cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, this week too, which is quite fun to see.
He gives you a lot, more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantages can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led quite a great deal towards his last single match at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made her first debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, with the captain of the Seve Ballesteros team holding five points above America, but just reached the finish line with their nose with the thinest margin, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get great advantages in Valderrama; we get great advantages in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but only recently," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching the 2018 class, wins 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by driving 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the point on the writing board.
We have a target, and the goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
It's nice to see the players playing in the field of hard golf, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never go ahead by myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will move forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk's opponent will ask his players to play better individually than they do as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been on both ends of the last day of the great game, had been part of the team that won in Brookline before ending with defeat when Europe did "Wonderful in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought the players together toward the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start it quickly as you see it in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in various ways that we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the fight against Rory McIllroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the top order.
"I went with a group of these people in order like this because I feel like I can close all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
The new German warship was postponed again.
The new German Navy guard's ship was supposed to have started in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it won't be there until at least next year because the wrong system and the increased cost, the local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, has now been suspended until the first part of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted military spokespersons.
This ship was supposed to be joined by the Navy in 2014, but the delivery post has disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The fourth Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship that was ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come as a replacement for the old Bremen class ship.
This ship will be equipped with a strong cannon, a series of anti-flying missiles, and an anti-capal missile, and some demon technology, such as radar eraser, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include a longer period of treatment — it should be possible to use the latest watchmanship for two years away from its original port.
However, the delay constantly means this advanced warship - which is said to enable Germany to highlight its strength abroad - will be obsolete when it begins to enter its task, Die Zeit records.
The f125 ship's bad-minded bodyguards had become a campaign last year, when the German Navy officially refused to appoint the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship's hull in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the ship's maker after shipping.
Only a few known reasons behind the return of the ship, but the German media cites a significant number of "software and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if used for the battle mission.
The defect of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by crews of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class warship.
Also, the ship’s bottling was too much that would reduce its performance and restrict the Navy’s ability to add updates in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with a similar class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to broken hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem of the new guard ship becoming very important in view of the recent warnings that have occurred as a result of the instigator of the German naval forces.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee admitted that the Navy was actually "exhaustion of ships with the ability to spread."
The officer said as the problem grew, because the old ships were no longer used, but no replacement ships were available.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg crew ships could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to secret bat lives quietly
A new research was done on a farm in Scotland's Highlands, which was intended to reveal how the bats used in their food hunts.
It is expected that this discovery will give new light on this unique flying mammalian behavior and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The studies carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by general pipistrelles and sopranos and long-range chocolate bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special footage will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also perform cell surveillance using a cable detector.
The soundmaster who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species do what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be made to make images by natural scale detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor to NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from the work of habitat management such as the production of grassland and the best way to keep forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England has fallen sharp in the last few centuries.
This bat is threatened by the work of building and development that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighthouses also pose risks, such as sticky paper to trap bats and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually bats aren't blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in catching prey.
They use advanced echo location techniques to find insects properly and barriers on their flight lanes.
The NTS, who is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has ten trained personnel, who routinely do surveying, polling, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only natural agars in Scotland at the farm Three in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson’s farm manager said that the farm was an area suitable for bats.
"Here in Three, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to understand more fully what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of a bat check before carrying out a preservation inside the property, because without realizing that there was a possibility of destruction of a breeding nest that could kill up to 400 female bats and a small one, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Batteries that are protected and killed, harassed, harassed, or ruined by their nests are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s headquarters for Trust Kelelawar Conservation, has encouraged the public to join in helping.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we have not known how their populations are in danger."
Ronaldo, who rejected the rape claim, was preparing a lawyer for demanding German news.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim over him as "false news," and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer was to request German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the accusation.
The attacker Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then expected to have paid him $375.000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in the video Live Instagram to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, threatened the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is a fake news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Lawyer Ronaldo is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call "a report of suspicion in the field of privacy that cannot be accepted," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would claim compensation as "replace the amount of moral loss that is consistent with the weight of the offense, which may be one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in the past few years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were rereported to the player's room, where he was suspected of raping him, according to a report presented at Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga says Ronaldo kneels after the incident was held and tells him that "99 percent" he's a "good man" who disappoints only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirms that they both have sex, but it's on the basis of desire together.
Majorga also said she went to the police station and had had a vision of her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because she felt "fearing to get revenge" and worried "will be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel that peace settlement because she's constantly suffering from the trauma of the incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England ‘will regret forever’ for the loss of carmakers
England would "feel sorry forever" if it lost its status as world leader as a car producer after Brexit, said Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added to Toyota, England has told BBC that if England leaves the European Union without a deal, for the time being it will stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said the impact of border delay if there was no deal, would harm Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis the Toyota production - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported throughout the European Union.
"My opinion is that if England leaves the European Union at the end of March, we'll see production withdrawals in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota operation in Burnaston.
Other British car products have stated their concerns about exiting from the European Union without a deal about how cross trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem with what the carmakers said was the risk of the supply chain if there was no deal with Brexit.
Toyota production lines are run on the basis of the "right time" production principle, with the cascades entering every 37 minutes of the English and European Union manufacturers for cars made as required.
If Britain were to leave the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance on the border, which industry believes could cause the slowdown and the lack of the body.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies more than a day at her factory in Derbyshire, company representatives say, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says the Chequers Theresa May's plan for a relationship with the European Union in the future is "calibrated properly to avoid screening on the border."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to reach this opportunity," he said to the Today program of BBC Radio 4.
"The result is not only from Toyota but also from other producers, that we really should be able to continue what has already been the supply chain that has been running very well."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the cost increase will reduce the plant's share strength and will eventually cost the job costs.
Peter Tsoulalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has been the manager of the United Workers' Society at the factory, said his members have become more and more concerned: "By my experience, once this work is gone, it will never come back.
The government spokesperson said, "We've put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, White House kicks in.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with High Prosecutor's deputy Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed a week more" because of the upcoming high-ranking high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russian servants, and the potential that impedes justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire the high prosecutor's representative or not, who would endanger Mueller's freedom, has been triggering gossip in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and possibly merge the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein disputed the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the midst of a report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose to not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on the claim against Kavanaugh, who later delayed the vote of the Senate.
Press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The time for the meeting has not been set, could it be this week, I can see that it is moving it back to the next good week, also recalling the other things that happened in the high court.
But we'll just see and I always want to share the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The host of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders said it's rare not because of the taste of TV journalists "who are trying to attract attention," though, he said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that Trump's direct contact with the press be enhanced.
"The president did more direct questions than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence, "we've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in an open session or press conference with the visiting high officials.
The solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president may be showing his reasons, doing free and sometimes weird looks before the journalists gather.
Health Secretary writes a letter to European Union workers in NHS Scotland on concerns about Brexit problems.
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will still be working here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England drew itself from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has committed to meet the current status assessment fee for European citizens who work in the transferred public service.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the British and the European Union on this draw still continue, approaching the decision that was expected in this fall.
But the British government has also prepared for possible scenarios of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That's why I want to reaffirm now how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of the staff, except for their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and enhance health care work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Runs Emergency Operations After Facing Head injuries
The back Gelandang Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury on the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Head Coach of the State of Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured reporters shortly before the outbreak ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Coach and medical power give Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before placing it on the stand and taking it for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "before there's a detail about the type of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a two-tier student in this red business, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five keys on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his total during this season into 18 tokens.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher materiel costs when buying property in England
Foreigners will be charged higher materiel costs when they buy property in England, along with additional money that will be used to help homeless people according to Tory's new plan
This step will hold back the success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
This charge will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in England.
The Finance Department estimates to collect up to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Foreigners will be wearing higher mater bea when they buy property in England - along with additional money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to slow the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target high income.
The cost of materials will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, along with additional money that motivates the government to fight the brigade.
Additional costs are additional to current materiel costs, including higher levels introduced two years ago on second - rate purchases and home purchases for rent — up to three percent.
The Finance Department expects this move to be up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-English people, who cause price rises and make it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to set his foot on the residential ladder.
Many rich areas in this country - usually in the capital - have become "the ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called out a mate - cost cut to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the price of property remained high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to disregard the quota for the houses in question in order to repair the "home tax" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of suggestions for reform in the interesting housing sector, including renting supervision and ending the removal of "no guilt".
He also wanted to empower the council to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last time I promised I would dedicate the prime minister to restoring the English dream--that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy a house that is as easy as those who are already working hard in England.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes a very distant thing, and an innocent attitude toward the living.
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "his main ambition" is to be Scottish manager at some stage.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, about three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Premier League last summer.
"I want to become my country as a player.
I got B hats and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watch Scottish teams in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always been something that attracts me to come back.
But that chance will come, if I succeed in team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former boss Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel afraid to follow the big names at that big club, after previously refusing the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structures and facilities in this club, it is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't be easy to be there, but I'll probably just see myself as a successful man here, if I can take this club back there."
Career Ross in team management was only three years old, after some time as a boss assistant at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation gulf into the winner of the title of the next season.
And Ross says now he's feeling more comfortable than he's ever done during his career playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably the road crossing that I have to go through," he recalls while taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, looking for a decent living, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still have it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life."

Summer summer waves have increased public income in Britain that is struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures show, pubs and bars see sales rise of 2.7 percent in July - but income at the restaurant falls at 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who composed the numbers, said: "The sun that shines and participates in the English World Cup is longer than expected to mean, July will follow the same pattern as the month of June before, where pub income increases by 2.8 percent, except the restaurant that gets a hard hold.
It's going down to a restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June, it's going to get worse in July.
A pub and bar sales so far are more powerful than what happened at a restaurant down.
A pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, even though it doesn't separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just came out for a drink.
Selling all over the pubs and the best-running bar that sells drinks up to 6.6 percent for the month, with which it sells food down three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure analyst and RSM hotel says: "This has been going on the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the impact of social events or major sports remain the greatest factor involved in market sales outside the home.
It is no wonder that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, even though the drop in sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the ongoing pressure.
A long summer should not come when the operator who sells food has bad times, and time will tell us if the temperature is pretty good that we've had in August will give you some rest that is needed."
Total sales growth throughout the pubs and restaurants, including the new ones opened, is 2.7 percent in July, showing delays in the launch of the brand.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales survey for pubs, bars, and restaurants in England collect and analyze the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined osset of more than £9 billion, and is an industry-wide torch that can no longer be traced.
One of five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Survey revealed, one of five children -- some are still 11 years old -- have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 middle school students reveals the development of the page "False Institute"
This news has raised concerns about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have "mainly" accounts to show their parents
One in five children - some of them are still 11 years old - making social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle-school students revealed the dramatic development of "false institution" accounts - a reference to shared photo sites in Instagram.
That news has raised concerns about posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate "the main" accounts that have been cleaned up to show their parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who asked others to " Rape me."
Research carried out by the British Digital Awareness and the Men's Head of School Conference and the head of the Women's School from independent schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
HMC head, Mike Buchanan says: "This is annoying so many teenagers who try to create online space that cannot be found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been selected to enter the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the annual public meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle was a cross-country athlete and a Scottish field most marked by honor and President Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those leading the sports industry to benefit from his international experience over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletes in Scotland will get great benefits by bringing him into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American athletic athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter run at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the total of four Olympic gold medals and now became the BBC's producer, is now unable to walk after a single ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I suffered strokes.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine if I can recover and reach the level of recovery.
It's like a very tiring job to recover completely, to learn again how to walk, and today to do the impatience training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump commercial that compares mother to cow has split opinions in the online world
The breast - pump company has split opinions in the online world with an advertising that compares the mother who is feeding with the cow being slaughtered.
To mark the launch of a product called the "pampa breasts that can be used with the first silence in the world," Elvie consumer technology company released an ad inspired by video music to show the freedom this new pump was given to express a mother.
Four mothers dance in the barn with a cow's straw followed a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm waving myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice this isn't ambing, it's my breast."
It goes on with the following: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them baby, pump out, pump out, I straighten my lady's milk."
However, advertising published on this company’s Facebook page has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a varied reaction from viewers, with many saying it makes "wheat" in the milk industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows should also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except the baby was stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," wrote someone.

Another comment: "Trauma that can be understood well for mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise the breast pump for the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
The other adds: "An ad that is meaningless."
Someone else defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "lucent."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still sucking.
Grinding makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is kind of crazy, but I'll take it if it's any.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial intended for mothers who squeeze (often at their place of work or toilet) and who feel like "cows."
This is neither advertising nor judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with the hidden pumps slipped inside their bra.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the eyes of many women who squeeze the ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is really hening, without wire or tube and passage inside the bra sucking, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is a well-deserved, convincing and provocative product.
Similarly, the image between expressing women and our silver cow would like to pump out the ASI and all its challenges, and show it in a way that is comforting and enjoyable with the full freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump is the main news.

Hundreds of Migren's Children Move Quietly to Tenda Tendas in Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children is increasing even though the monthly border crossing is still unchanged, some of the consequences of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump government that make it difficult for children to be cared for by sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and they are afraid of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by moving forward to save children.
Risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that the potential sponsors and other adult members of the household had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Bea Cukai official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of applicants for sponsoring children under the elderly.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record record.
"Almost 80 percent of people who become sponsors or sponsors are illegally present in this country, and most of them are bad foreigners.
So we keep on hunting them," said the Lord Albence.
Aimed to process the children faster, officials introduce new rules that require some of them to attend court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days, which have become the standard of the former, covering the workers of the shelter.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not live, to apply for their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those who are considered unworthy of getting help will be deported directly.
The longer the children are being arrested, the more likely they are becoming more anxious or depressed, causing increased violence or attempts to flee, the more workers are involved in sheltering and reporting systems that have been received in the past few months.
The lawyers say that the concerns are increasing in a larger facility like Tornillo, which is a sign on a child who is struggling tends to be ignored, for its size.
They say that moving children to camp without giving them enough emotional time or saying goodbye to their friends can make a lot of trauma.
Syria asked the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Spoken in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the state war had now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as the prime minister's representative, said foreign forces occupying Syria illegally, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without making any demands," he revealed to the audience.
Moualem asserts that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with over millions fleeing their homes.
He asserts that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territory from the terrors and the presence of an illegal foreign army.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially to train and influence Kurds and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-stricken region of the country.
With regard to refugee issues, Moualem confirms that they should return immediately, and he blames "a number of western countries" for "explaining extraordinary fears" that pushes the refugees to move further away.
"We have called on international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be a complete human problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was reached.
The UN diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel fortress has provided an opportunity for further political discussion.
A deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by the Syrians supported in that province, where there were three million people living.
But Moualem asserts that the agreement has "clear timing" and leads to the hope that military action will target the mujahids including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be swept away."
The United Nations Staffan de Mistura sent hope to quickly convene the first new committee of government and opposition members to create the post-war Union for Syria and open the way to public elections.
Moualem sets out the conditions and conditions of the Syrian government on the committee, confirming that the panel work must be limited "to review the current UN chapters," and warns against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 unless, because many liberal audiences who hope, the charges and scandal end his presidency early.
No one doubts, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, the ranking of CNN's main clocks has increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million viewers on the main screen, rising from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has held the top of the cable TV rating by 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headline news.
"It's a spirit that makes people interested in being something they don't understand," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedian and author "Just the Funny Parts: And some hard truth in sneaking into Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembered taking a cab in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice.
Why? He asked.
"She said, "Because she made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
Having the value of entertainment is a mess.
Certainly, unlike any other show on TV, the story stream from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the immigrant family can unite again and restore the global economy.
Instead, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Even so, not just being a citizen of the country who knew when you were six hours ago, you saw a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "Fear" source for his book called "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's camel bomber jacket worth $15,000 (" thick suit with pride," Unveloping The Washington Post) and the implications of the terrible Stormy Daniels description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"The nature of the policy he's doing makes him the same as a reality event that comforts you every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performance scene and the Trump story story (as opposed to NFL, commending Kim Jong-un).

He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and then the Supreme Court in his balance.
"I remember when we had all the crazy shows that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's kind of a joke, but it turns out they're right."

A lot of money from outside is flooding the tightest part-time competition in the White House.
It's only natural that Pennsylvania 17 was flooded with money, thanks to a return to the district of Congress, which had two fames in the same chair.
Pittsburg District recently reappointed, filed Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrat - who won a seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb is advancing against other leaders, Keith Rothfus Republic, who is now representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which stands in line with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the side of the Republican party.
The competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a large campaign funding between the financial side of the big party, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lambs are becoming more known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the special election of March, which is widely known for Congress District 18 Pennsylvania.
The seat has been occupied by the Republican Party officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Politicians send the Democratic party a little higher.
A.S. Balanced the punishment of El Salvador for supporting Tiongkok, then Back
Diplomats ensure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have admitted Beijing, by giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked hotels in Panama until the partner drove out the Trump Organization management team.
The Foreign Department decided to bring back the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "new decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, appeared in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishment is only considered against El Salvador, who has received help of some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The resulting punishment, which includes financial relief and visa restrictions, would harm the Central American country and increase its unemployment and murder rate.
When internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, government officials claimed that they wanted the conference to be continued, so that it would be effective to end the consideration of the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at that conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a government tax signal at that meeting, to arrest diplomats.
And the three American envoys were secretly returning to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new discipline or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokeswoman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three American officials, including two diplomats, had agreed to discuss internal discussions on this inconclusive situation.
Their statement was reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also talked about this inconceivable situation.
Study Story
Another surprising story is a report by special advisor Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's trial, which currently has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigation of Trump's campaign collusion with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moved in, Mr. Trump would be asked for responsibility from him, just as he was prepared to go again in front of the voters, and perhaps eventually become the jury of his partners.
That is why there is still much to be done, and I do not intend to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s rule cannot be avoided - or his complacency in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if only the West were to fight him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of slaughter.
The beginnings of history centred along such a dot of drifting, and a fast - paced or delayed democracy.
Now Americans are facing some of this change.
What should we do if Trump fired the Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the one who's monitoring the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, she suggested that the president be secretly recorded and felt that he was not worthy to be president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times account wasn't right.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that has just been asked by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite a strong accusation of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And in addition, will we give a part-time vote for Congress that will call for Trump's responsibilities?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse over time.
But I believe we'll make it, because the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once inhabited my great embassy.
He survived, then emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candle on the table that was written with a saucy.
By leaving that legacy to me, how did I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the game facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers saw Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning over Austria, following the good results of the strike in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape from the G League Group of Europe.
The knee injury made the midfielder Graham Dorrans can't perform in the first season until the 2-2 against Villarreal, but he was sure Rangers could use it as a stepping stone to a bigger sense.
"This point is great for us because Villarreal is a great team," said 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure to get something and go by one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it, but, we believe, the results of the balance may be fair.
In the first round, they might look better, but in the second round, we woke up and became a better team.
It's Thursday night, it's another European big day.
We were hoping to be able to handle three points of the match that would be a tough match because they had good results in their last game, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a really good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good practice.
I hope we can develop now, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although it turns out that the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people discussed with their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationalwide study discuss long-term care costs with their couples.
Only 10 percent of them say they're talking about this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start that discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide soul insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for care if you do not inform your wishes first.
Benefit with your family’s advisors, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean a lot to determine the cost.
The source of your financial advisors: Your advisor can certainly help you in showing you how to pay those fees.
The services you choose for long-term care include the traditional long-term care policy, the hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or ensures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face some of the legal disputes that linger.
Show the immediate power to your health care, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, letters of power in your finances should also be considered.
Someone who trusts you to take care of all your financial decisions should choose, other than to make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot.

A man shot a wind rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a party night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots were shot at the chests, the stomachs, and the hands.
The shooting was described by the officer at about 02:30 BST, and it's called "a random event."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victims did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses have been presented by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
So terrible earthquakes and tsunamis struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on the Friday, it had removed at least 384 souls, captured the officers, and the death toll was estimated to increase.
Disrupted communication led officials to provide assistance in obtaining information from the Donggala County, a region north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake center that hits the force of 7.5 Richter.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
The Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, while at the time, is an over 300 km (180 mi) cluster of coastlines on the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The economy of the South Sulawesi province is looking for fish and breeding, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the existence of significant nickel mining also plays a role in this province, although most of the centers in Morrowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
Recorded over the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Body.
In 1938, over 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala were left behind.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
In semicolon, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Ring and as a result the earthquake will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have swept through the past few years are as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, precisely on the west coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, until 226,000 lives were eliminated along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half the dead were in Aceh.
2005: Toward the end of March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: The 6.8 - magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, the densest island in Indonesia, leading to tsunamis on the south coast and results in nearly 700 deaths worldwide.
2009: An earthquake struck 7.6 in the vicinity of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
The victim died more than 1,100 people.
2010: One island on the island of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, was struck with a 7.5 - strong earthquake, triggering a tsunami that was 10 meters high when it hit dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and caused destruction, as well as the panic of those who remembered the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although this time there is no tsunami, more than 100 people have died because of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, a tourist island, also experienced a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, where most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has left thousands of buildings behind and spread thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor of Alaska and vice president's candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, obstructed domestic violence reports and countered arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaskan State Police on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took the phone call from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-trial Prison, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by the KTU.
As reported by the news network, Palin was attending the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, as certain" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three Class A minor offenses, which could lead him to a single-year prison sentence and a fine of $250,000.
Also, he was also charged with a B-Class criminal charge, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, charges are not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, who called the police to make a report on the allegations of the attack.
The case is now being addressed to the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of a drunk firearm, which is also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was violated by a growing Veteran group linking the violence of her son to PTSD as a result of her work in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead victims
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was struck by a massive earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
A 7.5 - scale earthquake that could potentially trigger a tsunami has left thousands of homes behind.
Electricity and communication lines are broken down, and death rates are estimated to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck the central Sulawesis, which lay in the eastern sea of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The videos show how terrible the moment of disaster has gone wide through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
The federal prosecutors pay the death penalty that rarely occurs for the suspect of a terror attack in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York paid the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- that punishment has been rare and has not been done in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is expected to make an attack by hitting the rented truck from Home Depot on foot and bikers on the bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "in will" killed the eight victims and "in will" caused serious injury to the body, based on a statement of intent to punish the death sentence, which was presented to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, both charges allow death penalty to be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury seized Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in carrying out a raid, which was usually used by federal prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as the charges of violence and the attempts to destroy motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early execution," as a description of Saipov's crime that is done with "shock, cruel, and barbaric."
Expressed in a will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counted a decade since the South District of New York dropped the death penalty charge last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the defendant of the murder of two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty last time in the federal court in New York in 1953, was brought to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the husband-in-law who was found guilty in a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric seat on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, does not show the feeling of regret as a matter of day and month after the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said that he was happy about what he had done, revealed the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video he watched on his phone, as stated in the charges.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to bet in his hospital room, the police force.
He pleaded innocent of the 22 charges he had been charged with.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" about the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death is to accept a life sentence of imprisonment without bail will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had appealed to the prosecutor not to bring a death sentence.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage is calling for today's 'storage of the people's workshop' in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should 'heat' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, suggests to participate in negotiations with the EU.
Conservatives, Peter Bone, told the street action in Birmingham that England should 'be out' today if Farage were to become Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenges facing May in the reconciliation of its shared position have been met by supporters of the Tories Remain who joined in the separate protests threatened Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his Chequers' compromise plan to remain on track even in the middle of the Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stressed that he would be driven forward to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he had a bad reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between the package's proposal and the 'knowledge'.
Bone told the Leave Mean Leave mass in Solihull that she wanted to 'get rid of Chequers.
It is suggested that Farage should appoint partners to be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If his responsibility remains with him, we'll be out now," he says.
Members of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I'm ready to stand up to support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
It is clear from his opposition to the European Union: "We are not fighting in the world war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone echoes the suggestion that public opinion has been potentially changing since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants a permanent state is absolutely untrue."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in this mass action, appeared to the reporter: 'Just as simple as I'd like to say, 'O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers is not popular among the generals, while the Opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with the parties and our activists who are really down to the road and make us selected in first place.
Our request, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
By a message addressed to May, he added: "The minister keeps their work when their promise is fulfilled."
Farage said that the political demonstration must be reversed in order to 'feel the heat' if they want to break the 2016 referendum decision.
‘This most precious time is belief between us and our political groups,’ he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we will not let you go.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic community: 'I want you to make our political parties, who are ready to disobey Brexit, also feel the heat.
“We are moving this country’s goldsmith who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the British independent, independent, and proud.’
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moves through Birmingham before taking action in the city center for two hours.
Active lines seem to spread the banner of Tories Against Brexit after setting the line at the end of this week.
Fellows in the Labour line, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservative group on their party's security issue when the conference was opened.
‘These people are the ones who tell us that they can master the IT system and all technology for Canada, anything, for the anti-corruption border, in an unlimited free trade in Ireland,’ his body.
“ It was a big show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' his love.
Warren's planning to make a 'serious break' in the president's cover.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to "bang the president's appointment" after his election in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat Party declared its future at the city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was often threatened by President Donald Trump, resigned in November against the state's GOP representative, Geoff Diehl, the vice president of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked as a Trump opponent by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with the voters, who had been nicknamed in the city hall since Trump came.
A contestant asked him a question, if there's any plans to run for president.
Warren said, "This is the right time for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and it's the time for women to occupy the top."
Arrested for Sims shooting, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced that the suspect had been arrested for shooting to the death of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announces Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. in the ET press conference.
They took video shots on Friday, where a identified man asked for help as seen in the footage.
On Friday morning, Sims, 20-year-old, was shot and found dead near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and eventually died," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, to the media on Saturday, through 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson fired a shot at him.
When interrogated, Simpson claimed to be in the scene, holding a firearm, and shooting him at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight and put in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department Parish.

A single Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world after the team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in a single qualification on Saturday that would carry the orders of the Mercedes team had a great role in the race.
From the Pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton because he maintained his position at the top two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the mud at the end of the crowd, something that was supposed to be very determined.
Mercedes entered a pit one lap after and left after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after a few bouts that showed Ferrari's driver's reluctance to leave the area empty with the risk of surviving after a double motion to survive at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid and was in seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held up the tire replacements to speed up the resolution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for the fourth position.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th lap but couldn't improve his step in eight laps left because finally Raikkonen took the fourth position.
That's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Team has done an amazing job to have a second," Hamilton said.
That's a terrible body language.
President Donald Trump mocks Senator Dianne Feinstein in a relic on Saturday through his village, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual abuse of the future Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a relic in West Virginia, the president did not make a direct statement by Ford before the Senate Court Committee, instead of commenting on what was happening in the Senate that showed people "bad and foul and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and wonderful thing that's been going on for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see the angry and evil and foul and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the swings and cracks and then they said "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, hold on a second.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak it," he added, as a senator impression.
Feinstein has sent a letter that sheds light on the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein prevented the leak from coming from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's charges, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein said to the committee, speaking Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he asked."
But his rejection was not approved by the president, who commented during a relic on Saturday night: "I will tell you, it is a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the potential Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed with the Democrat's claim to use charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see the crime, the suicide, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk for power and supervision," the mediaite report said.

Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants when dealing with Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off the defeat on Friday in Elite League when fighting Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3-scheduled stable match on Saturday.

Air Traffic Leaders Left to Presuppose Passengers on the Survivor of the Earthquake
An air traffic driver in Indonesia is welcomed as a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane that carries hundreds of passengers can fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a massive earthquake struck the Sulawesi Islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
A strong earthquake continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
But in spite of his associates escaping for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunanjan refused to leave his post at a heavily-moved guide tower at Sis Al-Jufri Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure that the 6321 Battish Air Flight that at that time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower when he felt the tower was starting to collapse.
He died afterwards at the hospital.
Speaking officer of the Indonesian Navigation Services Agency, Yohannes Siritan, delivered his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from the Balykking in California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached the Palu.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities concerned that the victims died could reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Body provided access to Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"Corban is still believed to grow because of many victims still suffering collapses and many others that cannot be achieved," said the national agency spokesman for disaster disaster relief Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave of up to six meters has made the stem stem that causes mass funerals on Sunday.
The military and commercial planes brought help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulance carries a dead body.
Clean water becomes rare.
Minimarket's all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia works hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's been a tragedy, but maybe it could get worse."
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the task of evacuation.
Ready?" report CNN.
Indonesia at the beginning of this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Mikronesia plane crash: Niugini's water sends out one missing person after a lagoon crash

Niugine’s water delivered at a record on Saturday afternoon, its share could not identify a male passenger.
The company said its side has cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline does not quickly respond to more detailed requests about the passengers, such as their age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after the plane hits the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, when seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline delivered the remaining six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Navy and the airline have both declared a plane landing in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the plane passed beyond the runway.
American passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane came down very low.
"That's really a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to navigate the high - pitched belt through the emergency exit door on the sinking plane.
He sent out the panic bombers and screamed, and he suffered a little headache.

U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for jurors about how he used cell phone recordings to collect various movements made by the defendant at age 29 Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on his death night.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some mobile phones that showed Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared with the previous defendant's statement, published Clarion Ledger.

Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the event.
When the prosecution asked whether Tellis told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies that Tellis is his statement that he knows Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Mobile phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett delivered that after the death of Chambers, sometimes Tellis deletes the message, calls and contact information Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped the victims out of his life," said Hale.

The other black guy?
NY's nanny demands a couple for attacking after issuing a "racialist" message
A New York Nanny demands a couple because she has been discriminatively attacked after receiving an indirect message from a grieving mother and stating that she's "other black man."
The couple refused to consider it racial, and considered it more like "glorious."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her dismay when she realized that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black after her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't care about other people," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, said that they were taking out a nanny, a mixed African-American citizen, for having done an ugly job and she was more expecting the Philippines, based on the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid a day's work and then returned to Uber.
At this time, Maurice demands that the couple pay compensation for the cancellation, and asks for compensation about $350 a day for six months, in return for the child's work that he had to do at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do anything like that," he said to the Post on Sunday, then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple fought against the claim that they were racist, stating that the workers fired Maurice was a legitimate thing to do, they were afraid they could not trust him after they offended him,
"My wife has sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Posters.
"But can you let your children be treated by someone you've been rude to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As it was wrapped up in "glory," says Plasco his wife just two months ago gave birth to her baby and was in "very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone who's in such a condition?
It's not a good thing to do," investment bank adds.
As the legal case continues, the public opinion court has made a quick warning against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publishers are worried that the reader won't have any contact with a talking bear, the new newspaper is out.
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, was born not far after the book had been accepted, explained in a letter.
It's so funny to know how we know about the great Paddington success."
Said his father, who was BBC cameraman before inspired by the child's book with bears, who was very optimistic about the results of his denied work, added the 60th year of publication of the book to be "sick" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, who he describes as "the very important part of our family," he added his father quite proud of his success.
"He is quite a quiet man, and he is not an arrogant man," he said.
"But because Paddington means a lot to him, it's like you have a son who's got something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he's looking at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it is the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter's dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was soon taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to say it was really bad that she probably wouldn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said he'd be dead in two minutes ahead and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors have given him to keep his heart running slowly and leave his body system.
He's been dead for a while while, and it's all dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't cry, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - without realizing what she had been through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head was covered in faint and my tears kept dripping all the time.
It's very hard to explain, but when on that flight, I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
The women who are grieving posting cards to prevent suicide at the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones were trying to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards at a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be reached to get support.
His son, Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a chef who promises with a smiling smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that the smiles sparkled the mood."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, 11 - year - old Brother Tyler was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any continuing effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can get close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "That's what makes a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in uncertainty when the FBI starts its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for--a time-limited investigation, limited by coverage--we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "disappearing" committee in the middle of the council's decision.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of self-reliance is caused by time.
The legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republic does badly, they will become very weak in its opportunity to make the people they want to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meet his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be election in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean buyers under Kim
The number of people who drifted from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since the seven-year-old Kim Jong-un, said a member of the South Korean Parliament.
Park Byeong-sug, quoting data from the South Unity Ministry data, said there were 1,127 shootings last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says border control between North Korea and Tyeongkok and higher tariffs imposed by people's smugglers are the key factors.
Pyongyang didn't give a public comment.
Most Northers finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Tiongkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
They often forced their return to the homes of the refugees and tried to treat them as illegal migrants.
The relationship between the North and the South — technically still in war — has been greatly increased over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the delayed denuchinization negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free Korean summit.
But on Saturday, Foreign Minister North Korea Ri Yong-ho blames U.S. sanctions for the lack of development ever since.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons on a side," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterics," saying he wasn't fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Nancy Opposition Party is accused of accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterics" and says he doesn't suit the temperate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The peloss made the comment in a Saturday interview in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman behaves like that, they'll say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Board of Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally challenged the accusation that he had been sexually harassed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times screaming and having trouble talking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also frowned on Democrats in the committee, saying that the accusation against him was "foolish and co-ordinated murder" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost his president's election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's witness proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was rude to Democrat.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrat," he says.
The petition claims that he would try to sue if he agreed, and if Democrat gets more voice at the People's Council.
"I'll say like this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit not just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," said Pelazi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
He added that he was a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of the decision of Kavanaugh against the Health Services Union or Roe v. Wade, because he was regarded as a conservative defender of justice.
In the senior service congregation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would give way to certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not time for someone who is hysterical and rude to go to court and expect us to say, "It is not great," says Pelosi.
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's ethical, angry for months and years, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the man who was talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of anger partly because he was basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of early work, in the office dominated by men, at one time I cried with unexpressed anger, was my neck being strangled by an older woman - a cold manager I always feared - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside of marriage on the boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, was very frustrated, to understand that there was no reason for himself not to run for president.
"That is not a mature decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they needed was a new candidate.
Someone called it "Swake and Seven Dwarves."
Since he was late in the campaign, he was left in the fundraiser, and so he swore he would not follow the election unless he managed to collect $2 million.
It's a final battle on defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave him $1,000 to the guy just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he spoke out that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions--thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made the fundraiser so difficult and to target voters rather than delegations, and anger against sexism-- made him difficult to talk.
"You might think I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacts to her.
"You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my grave?
Are you going to cry?"
How US-Tiongkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The shooting of the open trade between the U.S. and Tyeongkok is so overwhelming, and when the fight is still far from overdue, the tension between the two countries may have been beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to the expert.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing Tiongkok's key export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
This week's very significant outfit is done with a new price that affects goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. through Tiongkok.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently priced five to ten percent of the U.S. worth of $60 billion.
Tiongkok has begged to unite the US one by one, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
Telling Washington to step back means following a will, but publicly it's going to be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade competition pressures can positively support Tiongkok in the long run by reducing the dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries more dangerous than what has been noted before," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria's ready for refugees' homes, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready for a volunteer refugee return and offered help to rebuild the country that was destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem says that conditions in his country are improving.
"Today's situation in the field is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continued to rehabilitate the areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore them to reality.
All the conditions are now present because refugees voluntarily return to countries that they have to leave because of terrorism and the whole economic decision that makes their lives everyday and their livelihoods as targets.
The United Nations estimates over 5.5 million Syrians have been exiled from their countries since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in that country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would accept help to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive assistance or conditional assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures the victory of the Ryder Piala in Paris
European team has won the Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in European soil and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got its trophy back when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who tried almost all the time, hits his tee in the water on the par-3 hole-16, confesses his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Atlet golf Italia Molinari shines throughout its round, becoming 1 of 4 players that ever got 5-0-0 since the format that has been in the tournament beginning in 1979.
American Atlet Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest sequencer on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top scorer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 over Ian Poulter from England who might be playing in his last Ryder Plate.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia from Spain became European with a total victory with a 25.5 career point at this tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't hold it today.
It's a tough year.
Thank Thomas so much for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," said Garcia emotionally after European victory.
He gave his responsibility to his fellow countryman John Ram who beat legendary U.S. Tiger Woods 2&1 golfers in a single game on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost in his four matches in France and now has 13-21-3 records of Ryder Piala career.
Strange statistics by one of the best players all the time, have won 14 headlines just below Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the performance failed his team, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was this morning when we made Europe difficult.
We had a fight.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The whole 12 players play very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Piala Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to honor him.
We are supremely defeated."
