Inflation in Europe has gone on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than in the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community's statistics office in Luxembourg indicated.
The official estimates indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with the growth of commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" so as not to have to intervene on this subject at a later stage.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The final market prices for cereals have increased by 88 per cent, and soy has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will increase from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters (Young Democrats Alliance) has increased significantly since December. Thus, since 2002, it has now had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 percent.
For the loyal voters, the difference would represent, because of the highest determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) support against the support of one fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrats Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent across the population.
The number of supporters of both parties has increased by 1 percent on some of the loyal voters to vote.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous point below, the proportion of those who felt that the economic situation in the country was particularly serious has never been as high, it is 41 per cent, and according to 46 per cent in addition, the situation is rather serious.
After the most optimistic outlook of the spring and summer, families are again pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population plans to increase and only one tenth provides for an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in the previous Gallup polls, found that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political change is the proportion of society thinking that the discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without changing government.
While 35 per cent of the respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the riots last October, this rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believed that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent of the additional said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent complementary would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education registration fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital stay fees, respectively.
Auchan is the cheapest, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, unlike this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the trading triangle of Budaörs, the usual Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly more than a thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown" in large food stores last December, did not increase sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that goods purchased well below nine thousand forints in the past year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of the Unicum and the living fish remained almost at last year's level, however the prices of the turkey net, walnut and poppy net have greatly increased.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, in Auchan, bread was found only 1 kilo of 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle marked with two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, therefore it cost only 257 forints the bottle included.
It does not prevent that this year, in terms of Daily Shopping, Auchan was the cheapest and the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and the cheapest basket this year, we see a 12 percent difference while the difference between last year's cheapest and most expensive one's is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1 480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1 206 forints on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rate was already noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products so much they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so far that the cheapest basket was greater than 1,720 forints than the 2006 value, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the price of the basket was higher than 1,630 forints than last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months daily consumer goods prices increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic food requirements, the statistics institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the daily newspaper of the latter, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, already well costing last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indexes, flour suppliers occupy a higher position than egg suppliers because they have successfully accepted the brutal increase in prices by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets don't complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-served foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, major tails trained in the caisses of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
But, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain about polling companies not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the over-handling of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago, MRSA was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a man hospitalized due to a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return to the hospital due to a MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have been unable to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, Karolina Böröcz, the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, said.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacilline.
One third of the people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, trauma infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria may cause severe hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, small weights or with a weakened body.
According to the head doctor at János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily life.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA just the one or not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, caring staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks, and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in the mode
While the vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz says.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and in residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases only see the day if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the recovery of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological samples is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA thrives from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
The MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemic, the sick should be removed from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, lack nurses, many are sick, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has developed a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) presents among its priorities the prevention of the impact of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official statement concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd district was made.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd district, who resigned from his post, who had crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have been in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, communicated Friday, Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding had been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before flying.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crashed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, to Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the passage for pedestrians.
(On the other hand, the fact that he crossed the road outside of the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car starting a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident caused him much trouble.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Prosecutor's Office for Investigations in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for carrying out the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties with a credit contract of EUR 100 million. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later as a result of the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discusse the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of €8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the shores of the sea, Albena, the "Gold Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasing in number to buy in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the areas of trade and offices promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus being a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in a large number, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle will buy renovated buildings at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old unfurnished houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and, in general, that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since December last, Bulgaria is listed among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving an over-value in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is rising steadily as a result of an ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is more than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to Gábor Foundor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, professional meetings will end on Tuesday, but Wednesday, after the official opening, the Ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map expected to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the present time, there has been much discussion on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, they did not wish to discuss accurate figures, although they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent to 1990.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors composed of 16 probably members within the framework of the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), communicated Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing by 2020 its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from the 1990 level, regardless of the success of signing the "After-2012 Agreement", and was willing to reduce them to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Foundor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time had made an 8 per cent commitment.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period from 1985 to 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is great in Bali, as the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place in the range of two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, which was emphasized in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which obtained the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize to deal with climate change.
The emission reduction would be delayed and the average temperature increase of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British Army units report on the video-sharing site records made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan charge video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006 announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Kandahar Air Force Operations headquarters and are then transferred to London or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is essential
Air force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been looked at by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquaters" in the spring of 2007 and reported videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial goal of the air force, the videos were uploaded to the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make public the actual objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing in relation to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, and, on the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message, since it specifically justifies the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans did a game
The army is bewildered by the fact that, apart from the videos that have been composed and carefully screened, amateur videos have been recorded on the sharing site, which also presents, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never presenting the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been on the net of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were actually carried out, but the British army has only recently been involved in loading these videos.
American recruits a little differently using the American's Army rifle game for free. In this game the player can place himself directly in the place of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and Beignettes in Departments
Móika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beignettes and coffee.
Another ministry will host a feast with live music, another will enchant public servants with a tombola and will offer a drink to create an atmosphere of Christmas.
Celebration, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so the power is fun.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Department who will be invited to attend.
At Christmas, the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department plans a budget of 25 million for the purpose of creating the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a tendering company manager.
The building of Gaîte Theatre was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to contact the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay the use of its rooms.
This ball was worth five hundred people.
The party began with the words of welcome from the minister and dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: The evening was not mandatory at all at this dance.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a super party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees in its walls for 400,000 forints.
However, Móika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and to eat beignettes, reported the press service, the party will not cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his employees to take a drink in the local government and territorial planning classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall where 436 employees are expected.
It will spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the hour of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas celebration will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few welcome words from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not party at all for Christmas, communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas celebration.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Mega strike forces gather together
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their committee of strike on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic stoppages as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (Common Transport Company) will also strike up to 1 p.m.
The League's Syndicates will show Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA strike commission - MOSZ will also be set up, serving as the coordinator of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote to the Parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the matter.
According to the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, voting on the Health Fund Act is likely to take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike planned for Monday, major stoppers are planned in the traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite time and during the morning part of the common transport to Budapest and more than half of Volán companies will be likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, the list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report having to strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) have not been able to find an agreement on minimum services, or, as Christmas celebrations approach, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's public transport will strike from the beginning of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Syndicates of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teacher's Democratic Union called for strike for 2am and 2am to 8:00, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new retirement method to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee, in the case of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the system to pass the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth ground for action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League's Unions, the Ministry of Economy and Transport's proposal for secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the country's risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the Hungarian Guard activity, which was formed in August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society notes that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Hungarian and non-Gypsy people of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to possibly provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Roma and Hungarians."
The problem is aggravating, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the Hungarian and international media's activity "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, particularly with regard to confidence in the country's democratic stability and maturity".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national association of self-defence".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization as they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, otherwise of the state," they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method that, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The focus on civil character and association status is therefore only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of such associations in the court, but they are also a political strategy.
Analysis indicates that the Hungarian Guard activity is also a factor that increases the risk compared to neighboring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the Research Institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard, for example, resembles the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BUN) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma disorders that have occurred in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Bulgarian guard's constitution.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Roma have "feared" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had led to lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by certain Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own custody as resistance indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the Political Capital risk warning.
At the request of the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As stated, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a warning of risk.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days of which the number will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and in the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Days of rest are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the alarmers can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as was October 23rd, which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the celebration of work and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember members of our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or there is only one working day before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for the extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been making special regulations on days of replacement before or following holidays.
The Act extends for all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions turning uninterrupted and in-service, by vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year parties: from December 24th, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experiences most people do rather overtime or take vacations they saved for these purposes so they can spend the days between Christmas and the New Year's Day at home.
Next year a lot of parties fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the working-day level compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work holiday to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays, because from December 24, everyone will pause non-stop even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six crazy things that can terribly haunt colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that bother us almost more: they are things that "beauty" the day-to-day of a workplace.
The question is whether we are used to these problems or are facing the challenge and consciously avoiding ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," said a colleague.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (that is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to reflect on how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the night before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they're right to be angry at you about having hurt their property.
Don't bring envelopes back, post them into your pocket because it can be annoying that there is no more envelopes and you need them right now.
Do you have a personal relationship with your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop potions that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (subpositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Put the shared information into you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You think you're sick without the right motive?
When you call the office and you call yourself sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or think you need to rest that day, think that your job, your urgent business, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that would make you stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to keep them out of your way the next day.
Frederition, ironing, telephone
You're getting into your work, but the scissors of your colleagues are kicking you off?
You've become, without a wish, a witness to a telephone conversation that you'd better not listen to?
Do not bother your colleagues with colds, singing, loud-voice discussions (that you lead over their heads), beatings of feet, big words or discontent expressed in loud voices.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (editing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a crime?
If your work is not done for the time set, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone for that forget!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize him if you've made a mistake and if this has presented inconveniences for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix your neglect!
Are you feeling too much at your desk?
Put on a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting
We move slowly into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting the sound up.
The music changes pace and the bass comes to accompany the sounds from all the time, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr.2 released the Wings of Love from Zagar.
The Hungarian music life did not spoil us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground begin gradually to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of the garage rock tearing the guitar, Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a ally of jazz, electronic and pop dancing music, began to get known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 cited their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive to the west.
Zagar and his group have undoubtedly become "tendy" but no one has asked them whether they would like to wear this label.
The group reacted as necessary, it released a new and better disc.
The recently released Cannot Walk Fly Instead album can open new tracks for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Balázs Zságer's Fish.
We are there well with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle Group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real radio tube was found, mr2 Petõfi, which had been spreading popular music since early morning to evening, began to introduce the Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
It's all right, then (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: Does this new tube drive me to ask a question: Has your music remained well a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music for a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; no mainstream or underground, no alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternatives, underground music can also be poor and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere as well.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
La, people go to concerts and not only the young people of about ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am of course glad to see people come from more and more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the unsatisfyable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made a career rather west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow her path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust each other's musical presence and let us deploy.
At first, it was inevitable that our music should be compared to Yonderboi's because there are several of us to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm tree of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many of them heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you opened consciously to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube in order to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to adopt the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choral.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodesi [Neo], Judge Németh, who was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something else missing in this song.
The following agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I even sang the melodies the girls learned later that night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a single short Judy Jay), they do not have a role alone, they all sing together and they do not sing more loud than music, so music does not only help their singing.
They were behind the stage, too.
Would you like that?
Zs.B: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
What was voluntary, however, was that we did not want to distribute roles as a soloist.
The song also says that we must forget a little of our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, you just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to feel also this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you the most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and because I've already "dropped" this disc.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfids billions at risk because of its inferiority complex
A concealer fraud.
Thus his former employee is the French giant the Corporation General, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost nearly €5 billion because of it.
Instead, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all the big bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear him denounced to the police.
However, if Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, was based on this man's transactions at the end of last year, a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered in the past difficulties of reimbursement would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he's got it right.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Once I had won my first half a mile, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he obviously didn't keep anything for himself."
Throughout the questioning, he confessed that he had failed the reports so as not to be deposed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eurex Fellowship began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who's not risking anything has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the mere fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where's his willingness to risk so much?
He has only been able to his position gradually.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader, and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel told the investigators.
Yet, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by focusing on the decline in this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
"There was a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather they doubted.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
Now, that's when the start of the year comes.
It loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic has an opportunity to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech krona) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Program is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain through these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion krona next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, industry research, and also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
So far, Czech Republic has been among the new members among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Arnold German, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (approx. 1.8 billion crowns).
However, later he was released and lived as a resident in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending on the position between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be again incarcerated, it is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officials, or they will let German finish his sentence at home, or he will go to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that German was moving the government's money on a regular basis to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious corporations, and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went to the funds that German had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
What is exceptional about this budget?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The year in progress was one year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote on the defiance statement to the government this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without problem, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
That's a sort of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of opposing government and opposition power.
The latter is more media-attractive and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Political disputes are much more of an interest in opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments were suffering from three evils that the current budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first is the significant share of the statutory mandate costs, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social burdens, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the biggest deal.
The latter is public and relatively under control.
The real delayed bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
A lot of mayors often issued bonds, too much debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from tax, tax and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they had succeeded in reimbursing these debts through the massive sale of the shares of the distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only for official and verifiable facts, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for many years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is still selling it.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they owed the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that mainly falls back on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programs that have, just in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures, approved last year before the elections, were successfully eliminated if a gap in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system would not take place soon, then any policy would cease to exist in that country and whoever would be in power, it would only be administered.
In exaggeratingly, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats by distributing mechanically the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes the regular costs to be reimbursed by the terms of reference.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not spared as much money as they could.
If we do not really want the power policies to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens in tax and tax duties, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks have decided to tackle the financial market crisis together.
Over $100 billion will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the 11 September attacks that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent, or even reduce, the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl's customer report to the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still continue," said the Chief Economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central Banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession that could influence the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after it was not successful in reducing the interbank rate of London, called LIFOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, even though the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and England had repeatedly reduced their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will help to curb the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem of the fall in the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: the debate of ecologists is incredible
Global climate change is expected to be harmful especially to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again spoken on the global warming issue.
The criticism this time struck on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he said that the environmentalists' debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate is not structured in it at all, it's just a mix of words, leaving solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, at the time of the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed satisfaction with what his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
At present, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had enough provisions to draw up such a book.
He is an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, he said, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes are therefore normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In the light of the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which it feels to be a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have not succeeded in renewing their former driver's licenses whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driver's license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a decline in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are filled with applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
The Town Hall meets about 2000 customers per day.
There's a half-hour tail about.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issue of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an extra of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence, will risk a fine from January.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall rise to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, a fine was likely even to be fined by a person who was not going to circulate.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called the authorities for moderation and fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesperson Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk for fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is a document that people can decide whether or not they wish to have.
It is not like with the identity card that, it must be valid without exception.
People who no longer want to drive should be given their driver's license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
People with documents from the years 1994 to 2000 have three more years to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the penalties of detectives awarded to Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conniving with the gang of David Berdych, will make thirteen and ten years of prison, respectively.
The High Court of Prague finally sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 years and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for combating organized crime risked sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he does not wait until the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, which exceed the amount of 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty for participation in the holding-up of 19 persons, and today the higher court dealt with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Most of the accused, from the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-up and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang was in return 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the charge, the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed robbery, in most cases seriously damaged the health of the victims, as well as abuse of power by a public agent and the prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police have, in fact, discovered illegally detained guns, shells with a steel core, a visor for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other hand-lifted flights Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men in the vicinity of Berdych are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived until the court.
The main hearing has for the time being prevented Tomáš Pōta and Maroš Šulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
The lawyer of the bereaved families Igor Veleba wants to get compensation from the hospital in Třebíč for 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That's why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostal hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the time of the hearing.
"In order to be able to reach an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We're going to check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jabloňov demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been faced with remorse not having prevented the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of trauma at present and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave each of the families 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Chechnya are subject to civil liability insurance by law.
In the event of a failure, they must be placed in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
To date, the courts had recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated from the tables were hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valašské království brand (Kayaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, he had used the title Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former actor's collaborator.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing about the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko Kingdom refer to everyone just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a work that's almost ten years behind us.
Money research and event development," he said.
According to him, the money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to be left behind on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it is Polivka who used the title valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him in 1993.
At the time, however, this was not related to the project of setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making passports of Valašské Království.
A humorous action originally resulted in a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that its name and signature should be cited in the passport and even offered to the owners balances on the price of the visit of its farm and theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only made use of the naked idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between the opposing parties today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vstin for Polívka.
But from then on, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, requesting that the court reject it today.
What could make the matter clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He still didn't want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the King's parade in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disappearance of Prejudice
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be considered inferior to the average.
At present, however, there is his successor Peugeot 207 on the market, which, she, is significantly better.
As much as the combo called SW goes one more step further, I just have to think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatback, I complained, for example, about the space for the head on the back seats.
As long as the complaints are over, because the combined bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see how fast it's done.
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so that I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about too short seats or records is turned up.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body sizes is also significant there.
The combo also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is, therefore, its luggage supply.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy frame.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not clumsy and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to competition a rather average number.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is found that Peugeot remains very significantly behind, with the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to taking leave abroad or loading a handkerchief, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the benefits, I would mention the underside of the box remaining after the reverse of the back seats perfectly straight, or a very low footpath.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's why it should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, it consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having a pot of escape caught by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Browse tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable to all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine rising to 329 900 Kč is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have placed in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipe-glasses, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of Account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try adding additional equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So it's only left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is failing
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concern among residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases in which conflicts between immigrants and descendants of origin become violent.
The case of northern Kent, where the opposing conflicts of Slovak origin and immigrants are beginning to increase, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the chicane and the fights between the students have been translated into the relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a train bar a ten-year-old student.
The culprit defends himself by asserting that the boy insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant conducted by two teenagers.
The girls had allegedly sent this man racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he replied by apples and pears and then he discovered his butts," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to the point of qualifying conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovakians came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering on the beach a pizza, ice or exciting cocktails.
The kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriches.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and more, and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American Mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, circulated on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the entire American business show and politicians left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cultivated cars always travel to Havana, since the once imported jigoulis and fiats have long, in such a salty and wet climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is markedly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
For the past 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province, but also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still proposes a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane was returned from the plantations extended in the sugars on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how it is possible to see small locomotives where contemporarys are not only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks climb up the ridge of the bottom of the valley, and from fertile soil having taken in their guts, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and the trade of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and city-view character of this small town.
Koloniální španělská architectural, výrazně ovlivněná poudějšími francouzskými osadníky, za čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massif Escambray, is a place so far apart that in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay side by side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If we have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth seeing also interesting places around, such as Playa Ancón beach or the valley of Sugars.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which cheers after sunset and where the music settles only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village on the Far East of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that run there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has included the eastern example of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made there, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it has been there almost a hundred years after the Colomb periple) and from the hill where the old castle-fort is held and the current El Castillo hotel, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigarettes, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, bay des trueis and island Isla de Pinos, cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled up with pages.
Only, as we say, it's best to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of necessary soldiers and equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, agreed with Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing contest by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week called through the defence minister Robert Gates on NATO troops to greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the intensifying of development assistance.
"Development in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC channel.
Ninety-ten percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. Army, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter in the south.
But, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO Jaap de Hoop has made similar remarks today.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would take three days.
Who is passive
In recent months, conflicts have also existed among the countries involved in conflict on the issue if all the allies effectively do everything they can in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its liability.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the requirements for combat they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
This week, British Tabloid Sun has qualified German soldiers as parsessors.
"The hungry Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document completed by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British crew during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The burden of a debt of over 84,000 Crowns is the responsibility of each Czech.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion krona at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of changes in government budget savings, the department has reduced the projected amount to $152.8 billion.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt of over 84,000 crowns is the responsibility of each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted itself to more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it appears that, thanks to a lower deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the border of one billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns," said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the political situation changed, that policies were willing to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts Grow
The debt of the state is the debt of the central government and is caused mainly by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by bonds of the treasure, debt securities, direct borrowing or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt has increased from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion krona.
The state's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion krona to 123.3 billion krona.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion krona and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion krona.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is wrong for debt to grow, but on the other hand, it indicates that there will be a matter to be negotiated when retirement reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than we expected
This is the result of the state debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion krona this year.
At the beginning of September, as a result of a change in government budget savings, the department reduced the projected amount to $152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the government budget deficit, which is obviously going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initial 91.3 billion crowns.
Next, these are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state-owned securities for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
Today she was comparing before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, his lawyer indicated.
The British was accused of letting students from 6 to 7 years of age give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
She was liable for a whipping.
The 54-year-old British Institute based at Khartoum University in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with the attack on Islam and the dismissal, pursuant to section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"eight names come out of the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then realized a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear a label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything to insult a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", it is only according to him that it is an "innocent mistake".
Opinions shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talk about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most important name in Great Britain, he writes of English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this last name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without having been able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach a status agreement," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect immediate violence, but we enter a very difficult period," he added, referring to the fact that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, who bring together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo last Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was in charge of a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of Onusian administration in Kosovo, the Westerners feel that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina expressed readiness to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not agree with it.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced Kosovo's President, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden-Hôtel where these "negotiations of the last chance" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations."
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, in particular, that it had a "domino effect" in an area still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, that does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, his delegation had insisted that any decision should be made exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
‘The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word’
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: to the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sejiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, in Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old contentious between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians have to dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel has to stop its colonization activities," Bush said, recalling their obligations to the "road map" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty solving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three thorny problems at the heart of Israeli-Palestinian content: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert pledged that future talks should be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort should be made to wrap them up in the course of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set the time limit for the implementation of his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States" co-existing.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the root of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his interview with Saudi capital daily.
For the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in each of these different types of facts, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN) investigation, a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "to very bright allure".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right," said a policeman.
The control of alcohol used on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before defrosting, starry windshield, torn bumper) reflects the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-insurgent assistance" to the IPGN, costesia with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IPN investigation, at this stage, was dissipating the responsibility of police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the socks on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained buried the time the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have quickly left the premises, thus providing no help to the two young people.
While being cautious, the IMPN would also set aside "any serious fault" on this point.
"This is one aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one must be very cautious," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows is on the scene.
"We immediately came down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to hurt them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a fully pampered cop, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems, with the certainty that the people present from the unexpected situation of the young, the police were taken by their colleagues to the scene by car.
Still according to this witness, the rescues arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left."
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
"I will not let you say that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
Those young men were taken care of.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out on her side.
Tension goes up in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
They've been using stone jets, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were questioned.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped together in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president '' has urged the people to send flowers to judges who have spoken against the state of emergency and the detritus to those who have sworn to Musharraf'''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly covered by the exceptional measure proclaimed Saturday night.
It was to decide in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the President, on 6 October, on the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was issued and replaced.
''All that we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court judgments'', said the magistrate in The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president ''has no more'' after the state of emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Tariq Information Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that January's elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied strong rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armed forces.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24 per cent) as well as unplanned or unanticipated births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24 per cent) as well as unplanned or unanticipated births.
The various methods of contraception, such as the pill or sterilization, still present a 5% to 6% failure rate, estimates Ined.
At the same time, the liberalization of contraception has allowed a better "female mastering", according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for one out of five couples and if possible in spring, season considered as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a sun panel torn, indispensable to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky output that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "bricked" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking dock for the modules-laboratory.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
Therefore, the second task of the crew was to move a solar panel-based power generation module, which was already present on the ISS, with a view to putting it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the solar panels of the module with a width of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged about one metre by a cable that stuck.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It's one of Nasa's best spacewalker.
Great, resistant, very righteous, he has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training doctor was responsible for "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he broke down the fault cable and installed some sort of "tills" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained close to his and, from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-cane of insulating hockey to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts aboard the station.
Upon completion of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and return to the inside of the station.
Last afternoon, astronauts used a half-day break before today, seven astronauts did not return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS Title Punished in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is now in sharp decline in the Paris stock market, after the aeronautics and defence group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS lose 4% to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 as a result of the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which provides for the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of closing the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is ''EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus''', has announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the polls exit: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very blocked campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a televised message to voters on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as a united list leader of Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president had nothing to do with receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his predilection theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we want honest, more transparent and open elections, non-attached elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that there have never been such dirty elections, even in Eltsin's time.
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of the chess world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsatisfied legislation are two more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the Presidential, on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to meet a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both the legislatures and the president, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has delayed in this christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more that this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "give up their personal responsibility" which they had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What good to think?"
The phenomenon affects every social layer, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of what the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
The conclusion of 54-year-old Professor Tamara Cherednitchenko: "What good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only now accessible for a humanitarian purpose, i.e. individually and by name, upon request of a former victim or his legal guardian.
The 11 states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will lead to research "including the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public opening of these nominees because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide evidence of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Fr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University Technische in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 said the European Commissioner to Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given their green light to the European Commission in April to enter into negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to sign free trade agreements. Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A pact of free trade largely between the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson argued.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusually long offer.
"To alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its planned supply of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," says a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the base rate and up to 10 January.
This is the first time that BoE seems to put on the five-week cash market in an open market operation.
They normally take place within a week.
BoE adds in its press release that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans to the day-to-day online with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was Wednesday of 5,829%.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England have been accompanied by an important penalty rate which had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the book course over the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss the articles of the Socialist proposal on purchasing power, which amounted to a rejection of the text.
The text was part of a socialist 'nice' (singing at the initiative of a parliamentary group), and it declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National PS Office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the recovery of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or rent management.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of articles (180 to 115), the sitting was adjourned after the general discussion which led to trade, sometimes lively, between a majority and a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
MPs' leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the House's amending bill next week.
A New Festival Sees the Day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Republic Festival of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and later, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
The Glastonbury qualifier of the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones de C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia," Charlie Jones said.
"We were talking with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we became involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continued.
"We were happy to talk with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a wonderful festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents re-enacted the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours is rather in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were made to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavoured, but music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the duties of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the "Governator"?
"Be careful, the industry decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best," he says.
The race at festivals
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema by now.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be of all festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, that question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the filmmakers conduct interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four lengths and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year scholarship rally? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands to await the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as that will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchanges generally has positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest in the lack of alternative guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leaking effect to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
To this end, they believe that the grant will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decrease in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of gross and the danger of inflationary tension stimulation"
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchanger index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur each year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6).
Analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Investis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebounding of the index that could be triggered by information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
Analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While, Federico Olucha of Investis Banco ensures that increases will result from both the bank and the industrial sector.
The manufacturers can also benefit from this rally, in the event that they go there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December has been a month's slump.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003 during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17%, December recorded an increase of 6,68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds on its end-of-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices from 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30, and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 8:30.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to expand its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Popular Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the Popular Bank is looking for.
To attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street businesses chosen to open up.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new agencies but about renewing existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers from different streets.
In this way, time amplification is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The bank trader Ángel Rivera ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even Sunday and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco for the first time the value in Antena 3 rival's Stock Exchange
We've arrived there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect was his joy: 'what hurts me, it is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have lowered less,' he said.
However, he stressed that in a low market, 'we have fallen '.
Telecinco finished last day with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss to 15.66 % for a year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival, Antena 3, who gave in yesterday 1.52% and a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we profit in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary who manages the group's advertising.
In order to ensure that this fact is true, the television channel is expected to record for the current year a 3.6% increase in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Net Invoicing of Antenna 3 increased 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while Net TV revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the better relative evolution of Telecinco in Bourse is the important pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have the official compromise to give for a minimum of 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in expected growth in income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of Antenne 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurity recommends that both values be purchased based primarily on its significant profitability of dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antenna 3 (maintenance) for the many attractions and business increases.
3.
JPMorgan: it recommends that both cases be examined, since it has had ' similar threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress's vote on amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by parliamentarians and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of the agencies to ensure that markets operate effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernization of financial markets, as it strengthens the investor's protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consultation services for both specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultation companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and international order systems to the regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management, and requires them to keep a register of all operations they perform, to facilitate control by CNMV.
In passing through the Congress's Economy Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that the securitisation debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, who demonstrated with what happened with the US high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management to legally delineate the functions that graduates in Economy may have 30 years after the Royal Decree, which delimits professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services to the marketing of products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases from five tenths per month in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an account of the price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is indicative only because it must not necessarily coincide with the final data to be revealed next December 14.
"The IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, stated that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has specified in the Congress halls that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than during the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to today's announcement.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50 per cent to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit at the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing a few record deposits over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that is gradually falling in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and that it will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British banks' incomes that will be deposited in the next three years to get these remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the target of the 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Magnate Group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock appointed the offer of the Virgin's association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from the bankroad.
Totana Mayor was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard today stopped at the beginning of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the Chief of Police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of last May Juan Morales, the current right-wing Member, and until then the city councillor of the municipality, and which according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
Officers continue to search municipal and Urban Council premises, and there is no possibility of further arrests within the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the MP's 'popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession of the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged allocation of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galicia construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight persons detained.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer by the President of the Government and the Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the Spanish Socialist Party's secretary of organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Furthermore, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made public on November 15th his decision not to attend the next general elections and to abandon his political career in the fight against climate change within the academic framework.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he should return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Furthermore, he pointed out that, although citizens already know what the economic vice-president will be if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the President of the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or scream" and make "it more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only local place in Madrid where we cannot speak calmly and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know how to do" and he did not want to act as if he was already in his position to not fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change undergoes relentless persecution, both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a movement leader who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This requires him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain being the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors it occurred, and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not prevent it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits citizens will have to change, what individual and collective energy economies will we be forced to do, what economic consequences will it bring about.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there wasn't, and there won't be any explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Up to the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed so deliberately dangerous to Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not denounce and does not require, beautifies the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Since this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim that we move by bicycle or cool with the range.
Mayor and chief of local Totana Police arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, informed today of the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the city hotel, where at this time there were numerous officers, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Sol Industriel and the Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcie and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana instructed.
The first six detainees are now brought to court.
According to sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A. were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played the intermediate role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 accommodation, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that has been requalified and its project would require double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lot of Vigo on Coruña streets, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's comment in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA information above the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day he appeared there, curiously, the critique of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the course in Philosophy has challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, mentioned in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, has demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and has stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory course of Philosophy in the lycées ".

One colleague passed the information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered to be a fault only (Article 623.1).
B. Flying in a store for up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Penal Code, art. 270).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest Science issue.
According to Bernd Weber, the author and director of the neurocognition imaging group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed".
Researchers observed that when both people became aware that they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was larger.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals in the Balkans since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main leaders of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list, with the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach taking its title, ' Carla' (2006), not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who continues the fugitives and pressures the governments involved to shrink the circle.
What kind of assurance do I need?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is made by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is based on various factors, such as age, sex, age of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or use, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the greater the probability of an accident is high, the higher the score to be paid.
This is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of distress than their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
Many variables are taken into account by insurers when determining the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that fits his profile best.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 have to face various disadvantages at the time of passing an insurance contract at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and driving license seniority.
Although the ideal to be well-insured is risk insurance, other more economic options exist.
The most likely drivers can opt for any risk insurance free of charge, so that they obtain coverage of any risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the disaster.
"The portion of the disaster that the client pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the profit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, as the rate of claims is reduced due to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to choose an insurance at all risk with franchise.
"For the most part, young people cannot benefit from the experience acquired prior to an accident," the director of the European company in Spain said, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, after passing the 'novice fear'.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as his economic situation allows him to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest claims rate, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk insurance at all costs (possibly EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured person has a high degree of bonus.
"They have a more casual conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchises," Judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a free-at-risk insurance is preferable (as EUR 150) or an extended third-party insurance where the insurer has a high degree of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to arrive at the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measuring on Tuesday next to San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the Champions League, since it serves Italians to be first and Scottish to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, which has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass it to him.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC has to play the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of that month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null game at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and will ensure a better crossing in the final eighths.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't only be able to computer on this since with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope to rank for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth finals so that the UEFA champions' league could continue.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach the third place with a win.
20,000 people attending the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began in Vancouver, Canada, in front of approximately 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting was "bright".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted their tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the group's story was told in late 1990.
The meeting and tour of the world coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are on stage showing the bracelets offered by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show".
'Sporty Spice' who was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl exhibited for the last time in 1998.
First, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They count on her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine sends the alarm.
A fight on the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are convoked by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's own monopoly company providing gas, tried in vain to find agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas transits," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh at the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies for Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Ministry of Health of Scotland must improve controls on its non-Community employees to verify that they have precedents, said the Monitoring Committee.
Rev. General Robert Black's warning occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas persons it employed.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The auditor-general carried out checks on non-Community personnel following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He was part of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, because they suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Dissolution to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the auditor-general's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Bureau of Criminal Prioritary Controls, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have found that some information about staff has been well verified, it is not done every time."
Mr. Black said that the Ministry of Scottish Health carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he would do himself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out, function well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1161 people from overseas, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
However, the auditor-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with the identification of staff with fixed-term contracts, which could or might not be chosen to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for monitoring health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are perfectly adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its pre-employment policy and control system for staff outside the oceans of the health service.
The Secretary to Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, which is allied to the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pick on the last singer of Joy Division, Ian Curts, has brought five prizes, including the best film, to the Oscars of the British Independent Film.

The black and white film whose band was produced by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of barely 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, better known for his iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, got two prizes, the first as the best stage director and the second as the best beginner.
The Rock has also been rewarded with the award of the Best Documentary attributed to Julien Temple's film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The best actor's award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller realized by David Cronenberg, Easterner Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his coriac character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Prize for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, filming films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Crane.
Winston said he was proud to receive this prize named after the star Harris, star in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admirable in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of performers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia Block 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells that were conducting an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the missile smuggling cells.
Al Qaeda's supporters launched a campaign against allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees seem to have conspired for the murder of ecclesiasticalists and armed forces.
The government asked the churchmen to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim Allied government in the United States, considered to be heretic according to the Sunny hardline.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by appeals against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 Medina members organized into a "media cell" to promote "the Takfiri thought", the ideology of Muslim radical Sunni who supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostatized Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
The data from the European orbiting ship showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation allied to slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is water-free, devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a hot temperature surface enough to melt the lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of Physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are starting to understand why Venus's climate is so different from Earth's, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, maybe even with a living area."
Uranium's enriched by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but found that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million ($480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney stated that he did not stand up as a candidate for the presidency, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates in the presidency have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one that came out of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected much on the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the forthcoming elections.
We do not know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the applicants.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-on-one topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to call when they heard funny things: The government raised increases in approval when candidates expressed themselves harshly.
The toughest and longest evening exchange was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the forefront of the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term of office as mayor of New York City.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts, of using clandestine immigrants at his home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when they were asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (providing clandestine status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, coupled with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears against the outside world, promote the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether to put water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the entire Bible content.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about believing in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in a position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to be present at the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's summit in Iowa coincided with the recent prodigious grant research conducted by Libertarian Ron Paul, and the silences during the Wednesday debate.
Both of these have emerged from the nativity, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties do not agree to decide who is the most known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate unified the party of good time and convincingly thanks to a message of success on the American size, thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Workers' Griefs
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which he could hide; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra married-in-law toes.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle of which Gordon Brown would have spent well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister made a retroactive move in his draft election, stupidly insulting British intelligence claiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown had become Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a failure of the directives and a poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change in the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative bourde.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, Protestant against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of crazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is going unmanageably towards the exit.
However, governments may reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister can't improve things, not even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration no longer works; the ministers' offices take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and with no more objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to the decisions made by Mr Brown when he was a Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long inquiry into the funds of the "money-counting party for the members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is facing is not so tragic as it seems.
The gaffs are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party make him believe.
As in Mr Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to achieve the Stalinist tendencies of Mr Brown always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compared his donations to charity, said that he wished no public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big politicians' grantors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, along with Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of suspicious donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, making use of an inquiry committee on this matter consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it's under the command of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee of Public Living Standards, with no leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a partisan Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis pollute the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see pointed fins, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure the share of the balance sheet not recoverable or are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Fees and insolvabilities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point below its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 with respect to the personal bankroad caused a sudden fall in the bankroad archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the conditions for borrowing had to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers are required to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is fairly strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the program volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that equitable real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and thus the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the property costs less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to restore the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go to testify to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the subject of the government's investigation in the Enron disaster.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the "Third of Natwest" said they came to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to call the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the bank of the subsidiary for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was available to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastows and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have gotten $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron disaster.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million bond each, which forces them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in the bankway in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide his billions of debt or even propose his bidon speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in loss for pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were unsuccessful due to his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither sub, nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, from $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
"It can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Fier, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Fier was present at the Gulfstream stand, last Friday, at the Salon des Millionaires, an incentive for consumption, for four days, held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to attract the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from yachts in acjou to cars filled with diamonds like 50 cents.
Mr. Fier was scrutinising a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to its stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's largest spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweler.
She attended the fair for the first time together with the Russian distributor, The Soho Jewelry Group.
“The women are all well prepared and the men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare themselves as their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high-cooked dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems primarily to target the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to tail in the caps to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinum candies, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund ted bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly seated at the Royal factory stand of Delf Dutch porcelain manufacture, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand-made.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in blinging"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much in accordance with Russian standards) have already passed flashing logos to a kind of limited-issued brand that could not be sold at the fair.
Despite this, thousands of people, millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are upsetting the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of the King Koil beds, stated that he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with golden threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also stated that he sold to a Russian millionaire, the shiny orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of oatrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company erected four booths representing the British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire fair.
Passers arrested to launch a mass of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth, or at the expense of a few million.
"you see, here in Moscow, everybody can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Surgeon unapproved suspect of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving's evening when Ronald Livingston was looking at the window bay of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the White Cape Cod gates on West Scott Avenue.
Then there's the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by the police, residing on 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are waiting, the results of the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should help to solve this mysterious death that has attracted the top ranks of Newark's police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of the Police Director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for the County Union Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, stated that the detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died of unauthorized surgery.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they arrived at her house about 15:00.
and found Melle royo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators sought to understand if part of the house was used as a medical firm.
Wednesday, no one opened the door of Melle Castro where a fanned rosewood lies in the narrow graveyard ahead, and a dalmatian whistled at the back.
A blue cane called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes was lying in a hangar, next to a door leading to underground.
Two bikes all land hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since he arrived in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo was extremely valuable, helping him to navigate the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"She said "you have to be careful about this," he said.
"she was there when I arrived, and still when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce rates related to the effervescence of the global stock exchange.
The shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reinvigorate the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this harsh turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a later rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, such as the largest drop in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial tumult was accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it would fire 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are scheduled in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, i.e. 2.55% to 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7% ending at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted following the high demand for a monthly tri-money auction from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into London's financial markets that have caused credit tensions, has led to the fact that the British banks' monthly tri-bor borrowing rates have led to their highest growth since September, at 6.59% following a strong rise since November 12.
England is facing an appeal to judgement against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drum n°6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection team, who was exceptionally there to help Peter Moores, the coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the CEO of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national selector, at least in part time.
The one who won't win the #6 back will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is bad.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck more than lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that the selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is that just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new executives having obtained good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is only one place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless at least one chance is granted?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the Captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer of one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was full-fledged and continued to train himself to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 towers to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's going to play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but that makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricketer of the test, despite the fact that his two hundred marks against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the 88th-Pearnings in Bombay, 32 cents first-class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently fell on a 4x4 during a presentation by the sponsor of Volkswagen of England.
He only postponed minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (subsponsor on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from a distance, to ask him if he had seen it?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his glitter allows him to perform services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the true art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be the one who will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping that the city would find normality.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I went back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and now that the city is safer."
"They say that Mahdi's army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who imposed on his men to stay away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Amariyah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia drove Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him home.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he had encouraged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm home today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing warming of the capital since the United States troops arrived, and to the continuous training of well-armed "groups of citizens involved" and working with the U.S. military to defend their neighbourhood.
But others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion that everyone felt about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house when I left."
The decline in violence can be explained in part by the fact that the Sunnis were expelled from the Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden stream of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated State is leading in the field of vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derition, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This reflects the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools than average - many of them without a degree in Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," said Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people get their degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double-course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education in Sarrois has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced the whole state of the comparison tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is law-free - a model that intersects other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether students' performance is improving sustainably.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the rate of students at risk decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
In total, however, Sarre did not improve as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And in spite of the sardines, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could earn points in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarroises are not French.
Check the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon become tick-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will make the half-hour chronometer rise in the South American country.
Chavez became a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, by means of a new law, the watches will be settled at less than four and a half hours of the universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The starting point for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "cracked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone ring rages in the country: "Why don't you call" (why don't you call yourself) is the phrase that already over half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was declared by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interrogations of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to one prediction, a real under-value of salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll compared to the previous year in 2007.
"The fault lies in the low wage development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research on the Environment, in the journal "Bild".
New charges could also be in the case of unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credit or financial assistance, as the SPD politician put it.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the inflation rate to its highest level since 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere in life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European Space Survey "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there is lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today has shown the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Cyprine theory, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: the thunder would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If there was life, it must have been a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should not be much living things on Venus' surface today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes 500 degree temperatures.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the venusian research, as no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed to be at first.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the well-known wind turbines in the north pole, a cloud tower in the south pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piconi of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Physica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: one Venetian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the dispute of the parties concerning the acceptance of the Dalai Lama at Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for the attack on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and the great coalition to close the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for cultural differences," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a significant balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new China policy.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of one China alone.
"China knows that too," said Köhler.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, about the CDU's "priority policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at Chancery, virulent irritations made themselves felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only ordered the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to Spiegel's information, also frozen the said dialogue of the foreign ministers' strategy.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires the German chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, supported Wen Jiabao thus the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he was trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those in France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
All must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, the Minister of the German Interior has demanded.
The German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of a similar trend in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not become a part of us as well and that it decomposes itself in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" published in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"Summies of integration into Islam conferences, this is already showing its first success."
But it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems neither from the point of view of urbanism nor from the point of view of France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater efforts were being made to integrate the German government, which was required by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
First of all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that social control in families was more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be cautious."
Young people should be allowed to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, and a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
Three arrests and a few burned cars and dust were reported by the authorities.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit from the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the disturbances overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor's utopian entrance shows that the coalition ended with the background - and there's nothing to wait for.
In which country does this chancellor live justly?
After his disheartening intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, we must say: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of concentrating too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptive sentence.
It is provincial, has she said and has only shown that she does not want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate this criticism was.
There was no real interest or little feeling for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a helpless politician, who flees into foreign politics and who even remains in the plow.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate targets should be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of itself - to have so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it yet two years ago.
Now it crumbles into all-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
It thus destroys its image of pragmatist, which solves problems rather than beautify the world.
But in the midst of the Angela cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He's still got a few accessory phrases for that.
In this regard, it reveals the number of times in which it passes when it comes to family allowance.
Merkel needs three start-ups here to pronounce a specific half sentence.
She's lying in an unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of the Republican candidates for the Presidential, the two favorite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestine," reproaching his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against his side with heavy reproaches: "I would say his own house was a havre for clandestines," Juliani answers and reproaches the former Governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates attack: since the Republican base also has no official favours, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies Internet users sent via YouTube are hardly more than blowers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," launches John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong lesson from Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called Waterboarding, a method of interrogation where the core is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg common hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause is reported in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites reside again.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney and presented his excuses to the base and to the television audience for having in 1994 still been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani, on the contrary, goes into a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life.
One day after his withdrawal as the head of the armed forces, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military rule are ending.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistan's television live broadcast the ceremony at the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
Wednesday he had handed over his duties as head of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus doubled to international pressure, especially that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of state.
By withdrawing the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Soon after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its rank, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the military spokesman's instructions, a bomb exploded on a street near Afghanistan's border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
Germany's super-groups of the seventies played their part: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were published.
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three announced gentlemen on the evening display.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, is in the middle of a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked left by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added by inadvertent to a piece of traditional music.
That does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group played again assured some of the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is based on the collective memory of the pop, but in no way as long as it is sustainable so that this group has been missing too painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn't German also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
Even more so than what is termed erroneously "Krautrock" has become even more abundant in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the surprise no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother went to the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in oneself and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then at Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly settled in Kraftwerk and finally named himself a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Roth followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an ancient farm of Weser, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
So-so-called in the trash was a fan of the choir Harmonia Otenstein and also a name for art.
Many hold Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following album "De Luxe".
For also serene and modest that sounded music, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve itself.
The "Live 1974" CD that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griesem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone thinks they remember.
At that time, he expressed the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster revives itself in the eighties and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album Griesem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been deposed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised at the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase appears in the room in the middle of the single sounds: "Only real music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar-cable tools are used for the formation of legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to shoot the instruments of the inouid sounds through the instruments of self-built effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three of them are great technical fignolers.
At this very time, there will be no change in the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It never happened to rock.
The roots have been less sought in blues than in the conservatoires of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of the artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is now no longer irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
It can tap on someone's nerves (?) or give you fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Death Peace", two films are again addressing the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Either projects rely too much on the action and the exchange of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too horrid.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news at first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic always hide in the Balkans mountains, but it is right there, in the most lugurous behindland of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had in the last place lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because many too many friendly and futile roles in women's sentiment movies and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism pleased him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why today's films must be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: at the bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not so kind: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with German production "Death Peace", which also leaves this week, the endless after of films missed on the Balkan War.
"Death Peace" is a quick trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save one of the Kosovo francs-snipers, in which one of the two falls quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that Serbians are not presented here for once as the only causes of all evil, this film is as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of foolish shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a instead war.
On the contrary, one can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the end there has never been a good movie about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military can't do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also assign him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak subsequently murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when it is carried out, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be seized against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally well agreed) not to drive hunting intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to the idea.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the swollen front, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which imply how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movie about the Balkan War.
Recently, it has been reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa yet.
Which is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a mine field, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or ""Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have passed before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the holocaust with Schindler's list.
Some films are still to be ripened - those who today are worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today just too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatombe arrives live on two screens at home,
And it's nice to the screenwriters for the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" has in fact become so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we don't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps you should have the sarcastic artistic and distant look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemperière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only due to the fact that some things never change".
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps the critique for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The fall of the mayor with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympic Games has struck in politics and the economy with virulent criticisms.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of the chances.
The head executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which Hambourg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Federation for Olympic Sports," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, about Munich's candidacy for 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means to us, that, in the time span that we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Sport Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A departure from the candidature would be more in contradiction with the statements of the Senate Chief at the time of the reception of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools in plenary assembly.
There, Von Beust would have called Hamburg's 2015 University nomination as "no substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first been appointed as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The Mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic map and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Small Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "factor Event".
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidacy would have been a great deal of excitement for its part in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, broke up against Leipzig.
It's not the Warhols caisses.
The one that connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's works list.
A large part of the ninety-five Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal searches of the Moderna Museet de Stockholm lead today to a discouraging result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
Ancient history is shrouded, a conceiting chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - of the hundreds of carton-made Brillo boxes: They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo board factory.
These were not works of art, but, rather, their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to Moderna Museet.
witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the term "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed that some 100 wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have transferred to him.
In fact, the 105 caisses of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, including two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and engraved, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals that the paint was applied directly without a layer of background on the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - and it is not an oil painting, but a acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol", lets the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, Moderna Museet will classify the six caisses in his collection as copies/materials of exhibition."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powder soap boxes.
But since we were there, there was an inexorable silence.
Manila's Rebel Soldiers Abandoning
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers quit, the same ones who had left a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who confronted the President with corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had recently attacked the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had retreated from the building for hours.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to eclipse suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Hotel Peninsula and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops to power circled the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously commanded the Scout Ranger elite unit, said that other units of the army wanted to join the march shortly.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by corruption complaints.
The Manila finance district has been the theatre of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke out almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts at putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a leading shareholder of Versailles.
United Internet has engaged in more than 20 percent of the Versailles telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a purchase.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versailles.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, has communicated United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, tell us about the market.
The day before, United Internet had already gained nearly 10 percent participation in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As a result of an increase in capital, Drillisch put in Stock 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a spokesperson for United Internet.
Both companies founded the company in participation MSP to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their 10 percent share of Freenet, and do not use their 18.49 percent additional share of Freenet, United Internet Thursday.
Both companies would, however, be left with all the options open, especially to increase participation in the SA Freenet, which was learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still difficultly predictable poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers related to a mobile telephone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch have so far had a direct share of 6.01 percent in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent additional.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
