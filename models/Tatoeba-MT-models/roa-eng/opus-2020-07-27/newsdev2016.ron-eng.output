Former head of the Brazilian presidential office is brought to the court
Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for the alleged involvement of it in a massive pattern of corruption on Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office said that Jose Dirceu will be sued for the charges of corruption, deception and money laundering brought this month.
Other fourteen people will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers' Party, now in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of the Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the governing Workers' Party taken into custody for the links with this scheme.
Dirceu served as chief of the cabinet of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for engaging in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
Prosecutors said Dirceu developed the Petrobras bribe take-off scheme, accepted bribes while it was in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the purchased votes.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribe and other illegal funds.
Some of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and its allies.
It would also include bribes to the Petrobras directory in exchange for swollen contracts.
‘miraculous’ recovery of a surviving student from the Peshawar massacre
A paralyzed teenager who had been shot four times in Pakistan's most severe terrorist attack succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors in Pakistan had told him that he would never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the Peshawar Army's public school in December last year.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be expelled later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, on a typical Tuesday morning, Mohamed stood at the time of first aid and listened carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men dressed in guards uniforms entered the army's public school.
They wore belts with explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all men, women and children coming out.
“I can’t forget what happened that day,” Mohamed says with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheatre, asking questions... and then I heard gunshots out.
The terrorists entered and began to kill. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he took four students out of the amphitheatre as the carnage unfolds.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, yelling at him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Muhammad's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the creek down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then the Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," said Sher Khan, Muhammad's father.
Those nine months were the hardest in my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his legs again.
They campaigned and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting support from famous people such as Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment to the private Harley Street clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "feared" when he arrived at the hospital.
"He spent the last [a few] months lying in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other," Malik says.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a good shape.
A vertebrae at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip, and back during the attack, and the lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to re-law the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised at what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed got up and began to step up and go.
We weren't expecting such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks since the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged the fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the weapons images drawn by him next to the school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but psychological trauma he passes through and now is unimaginably.
"My fury hasn't dropped," he confesses.
In my school they were killed small children.
What crime did they commit?
His mother tears, comforts him on the rise, and says: “I see my son going again.”
He'll be able to keep his life going.
4G “Super Voice” service from Three provides better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
The mobile phone provider Three launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve the reception inside buildings and in rural areas without signals.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
Other networks also intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VOLTE)".
It only currently works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three notes that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and can use their phones in more places than they have done so far.”

Steven Wilson: "If I do nothing, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson has recently been designated as the great winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent has won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a work of intelligent, expressive and captivating art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of many musical projects, the most famous of them being the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" width of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyls and his loaded program and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era, and I remember when I was just waiting for the CD, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a disk, going with him home, had a scratch, and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there's nothing more to really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you get absorbed in the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have to be like that if some young kids remember vinyls they like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you have in particular?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyl in the '90s.
All the vinyl we've bought again.
I started from the idea of rebuilding the collection I was 15 years old, but I went beyond that limit.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it is somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a lead to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the day of the record stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of suggested discs gather some of my shortest and more accessible songs.
I came to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I kept the project going only on vinyl.
Those who buy vinyl also receive a high resolution downloaded variant.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I'm focusing on longer music, there's one thing I've always liked above all else: the melody part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put the accent on the melody and on the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want to reveal too much.
The device will be completely different in each of the nights.
In the first, there will be a version of Hand. Erase. that we had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will rather be an incursion into my history, it is oriented more towards fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the second night?
And me and the others in the tournament team are big fans of [the comedy series on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always quote from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
It seems to me that I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You have remixed albums of bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Rejected to Sing, was, without a doubt, the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the word progressively.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an ethics of incredibly powerful work.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remixing was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I'm doing, it's a privilege, but if I was lazy, I don't think I would have survived.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on September 25th.
Steven Wilson will sing at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European Tour.
A new contract brings back jobs to Skytrans
The new Skytrans hired a part of the airline's staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the renewed company in Northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport employees to the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members have regained their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that made up a large part of the airline's business.
The bankruptcy caused several communities to face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliamentary for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, rebooted the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, Executive Director of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We were able to reassess 18 members of Skytrans staff in full-time terms, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also delighted to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we grew up 100%, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract seeks to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which preserves Cape York and the Strait Towers, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights back per week for QGC staff and entrepreneurs from Brisbane to the locations of Chinchilla and Taroom in its 36-season Dash-8 aircraft starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are delighted that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a Queensland company," he said.
The Skytrans Contract maintains its high quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentarian and Mother's New Lady Kelly O'Dwyer receives advice to make a larger reservation of milk to avoid losing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be part of the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy their portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a greater supply of milk for her newborn to prevent breastfeeding from intervening in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a nursing parliamentary, according to current orders.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
According to the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - mothers who breastfeed obtain a vote in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip did not know about this exemption before consulting the opposition discipline officer Chris Hayes in this matter.
Things rushed on two occasions, when O'Dwyer couldn't attend a division meeting and couldn't fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just started breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentary was planning to make a larger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentarian from Queensland, is in charge of the government's discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
They both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was furious when he was told to make a bigger milk reservation instead of nursing his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the creation of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a liberal national parliamentary from Queensland, was promoted as a disciplinary officer by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the February census motion test.
O'Dwyer, in the picture with Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son Percy, is one of the three mothers of Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censure by which he wanted to remove him from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, a Tasmanian liberal, was also promoted and appointed to be responsible for deputy discipline.
Nickolic had recently kept the newspaper's first page, after it had been discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message in which he had asked him to quit contesting Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
She is one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party, Catherine King, said on Wednesday that the voting power for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years]," she wrote on Twitter.
The disciplinary officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, which said Wednesday he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more than me to see more women depending on power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, in the country," the Prime Minister said to reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included one woman in his first cabinet and, following pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the December renewal.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will they react to markets?
Mal Maiden, a BusinessDay publisher, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull may have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's ranks as Prime Minister.
The main reason is that most of what many of them would have wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he just got into a suspension negotiated because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke in unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, to reach political agreement and to do things well.
So what exactly awaits the country's largest companies and their representatives from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull itself established as the initial objective of the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which he announced on average that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized the "revolutionary economic shocks" of the Labour Party on that problem and expressed concern about the racist temptation of the critics.
“In the context of ChAFTA, winners are, numerically, much more than losers,” he said in the same speech.
The business environment expects him to win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is a key point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the country's 100 largest companies) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and negotiate with the whole senate.
Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to some differences with the business environment.
The assessment of the effects on large mergers and other contracts shall apply in order to decide whether consumers will suffer because of the lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this evaluation is drafted is extremely important for results.
The Harper analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the assessment of effects, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to run away from the smaller operators market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was by the Australian Affairs Council and the great retailer.
Turnbull now realizes that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped to the fire to say that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of Harper's analysis, consumers will have to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by doing so by letting Bruce Billson, the minister for small businesses (which is on the part of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments to his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet may contribute to preventing breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women aged between sixty and eighty years.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their "significant" probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the table of multiplication under the sign of question
Terrence Howard thinks I completely misunderstood the arithmetic.
The negative character of the Empire told Rolling Stone that he doesn't think one or two is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If one or one makes one, it means two is worthless, since one or more of them have no effect.
One time they do two, because the square root of their four is two, so what is the square root of their two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors did not agree with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
“You can’t close your eyes when you know that something is wrong,” he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics by the name "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wires, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one times one" and other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The editor of Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "higher, more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional infinite shapes, bound together with copper wire or magnetized."
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for improved construction brick applications").
Also, the actor in "At the footsteps of an idol" also says that Pythagoras Einstein and Tesla would "crazy" if they saw Terryology.
“You know, ” he says, “I’ve been wondering since I was three to four years old, why does a bubble take round shape? ”
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
“This will be the last century our children will learn that one or one makes one,” he said.
They will no longer need to grow in ignorance.
Twenty years from now, they'll know that one times one makes two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check it out in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star played little at Fallon's Wheels of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did good work by imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name has been in the press.
On the same day it was also at "Good Morning America", where it opened the show with the incident of the gogoash's lintel.
Taco Bell hopes the restaurants "Cantina" in which wine will be served to become points of urban interest
Do you want to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the chain of fast food restaurants in Mexican style will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a menu of snack tapas, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants in the chain, which is addressed to young people, concentrate on increasing numbers in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has almost 6,000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast-prepared food, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average of 7 USD Taco Bell payment note, the company used drive-through service and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell says that, in order to address the new generation that “takes the most central urban environment in which to live, work and have fun”, the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it's like to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow yourself," said USA TODAY Neil Borkan, franchiset Taco Bell who will operate the Chicago location.
At Chicago's location, the new menu will be prepared along with the traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you will be able to see the food yourself" before it is ready, said to Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also at the new location will serve wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages, following the recent example of many of the competitors Taco Bell.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer evening menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
One thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an indoor courtyard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the chain of fast food restaurants wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a high-quality food line in 2012, when he inaugurated more expensive Cantina and burritos menus, to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will still be a step to a higher level.
Taco Bell said by 2022 he plans to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be like "Cantina".
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John's courting Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on the phone on Monday night, only a few days after the British artist publicly declared that he would like to meet Russian politician to discuss former legislation in Russia together.
The British singer, a homosexual said, tried without success to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, a year after he challenged the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, during a troubled period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "homosexual propaganda" in the children's ranks.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement to fans: "Although I am gay, I always felt that I am well received here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about what I was, I couldn't compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for that, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist discovered that he wanted to meet Little to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there's no clear information on the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "counted" all in the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a scathing conviction, "sing" in front of the judges and detailing how he distributed millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Audited yesterday at the High Court of Marriage and Justice in the file where he is tried with his son or Alin Cocos, former chief of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Dispatches in the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was hit by the lightning of sincerity.
He recognized all the charges and told judges how he helped Gheorghe Stelian in the case of damages at ANRP, instead demanding that he be tried faster and take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he knew Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he was engaged with him after several real estate.
He specified that Sergio Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him he was working at ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money that I told him I'd give him in several trenches.
I promised him political support to stay in line.
"Diacomatu then told me that he was helping me, but that he needed support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He also said that, later, through knowledge, he had come into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Committee of Dispatches, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave her five million euros.
The Dumitrean victim a million euros, and I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros.
I need all this money in transit to make sure the file is solved.
"So I told them to fix the file, make amends," Cocos said.
Asked why he came to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second record, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also pointed out that "it was notoriety that at ANRP all members understood before the meeting."
I wasn't nervous that they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All functions were political in ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatu.
"I told him that I would help him politically just to quiet him," Cocos concluded.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was in DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file "Turce - Ruvinari".
Victor Ponta ran away from DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convined as the prosecutor of the case will receive him for a discussion on the margins of the file in which he is researched for false in inscriptions under private signature, complicit in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, even though the documents he could have sent by lawyer.
It wasn't like that, given the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister left after five minutes, while he left several documents on the record.
I wanted to file (file n.r.) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done it, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other's business, because as long as the taxes are paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is binding, certainly, for all countries in the European Union, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, at the exit of DNA.
Ponta also said that, from the point of view or point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it again to the hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the disjunction of the file.
Iohannis is pleased with the mandate without TV
In Romania today, there is no legal provision that forces you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is assumed that the post of president of Romania is also recorded in connection with the daily realities.
President Iohannis sank daily into a total silence in his office or at Cotroceni
Only to the surprise even of his closest people at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have a TV in the president's office.
And after not watching TV - no programs, not even the German posts RTL or Pro Sieben -, the president does not listen to the radio stations and does not read newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or request with priority.
Instead, Iohannis was happy to only receive the report with the news that put it in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-sustainment, in which the only breach is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockade that, through its passiveness, the head of the state pushes the entire activity of the President's Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so bitter since its installation in office, Yohannis hasn't yet signed the loyality statements of more than half of the employees of the President's Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both humanly and legally.
Quiet and peace
Those in the presidential climate are already clear that no one and nothing can harm the "feng shui" of the state chief's office.
Where is quiet and peace.
What's right, only after nine hours without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former building of Sibi asks the officials to present it.
A habit that probably didn't get out of the time when he was leading the primary city of Cibin.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in the office has already been born numerous legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to bow to the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have any radio cameras.
Only at this rate will he meditate as soon as in the dark, because lighting devices can hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just for the good
Also, another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is delivering to the head of the state only the "positive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of the state will receive on the bionus its content.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that he was banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night television broadcasts on which he was criticized, but he demanded negative news every morning, with priority.
That doesn't mean the museum has helped him with anything, but, that's what, the gesture matters!
And at least he can't ever have the excuse that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, in the end, you're gonna love her and mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the President's Administration.
That, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in charge and which must also bear its signature.
Only from December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation even half of these statements, although it has to happen in no more than 30 days.
Like hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the state chief doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be thrown out.
Only these people have not received any negative advice!
So, at one point, they can come anytime to the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That until he decides and the president whether to give him out or confirm him on the posts, the decision being his strict.
Authorities said a teenager was launching an attack on the Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The inspired plan of a teenager's ISIS to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the United States was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in Philadelphia in August when the law enforcement authorities abandoned the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the president of Homeland Security, said during an interview on Sunday, a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at "This Week" at the ABC.
Pope Francis was not referred to as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
the common information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, in which it is claimed that the adolescent was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, having as a target “a foreign denitar during a high-level event”.
The bulletin mentions that the minor has radicalised through social networks.
It is possible that the teenager suffers from a mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young man's illness.
On Sunday, McCaul also acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" on the whole nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Service about a "strict secret allocation" for the Pope's visit.
And with that comes a great security risk... but, as the time comes, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean at Fox News realized this material.
The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, say experts
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details of the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The Colloony, Sligo, fell during a storm that happened this year, shining the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monument Service brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze remains, thus discovering a creepy story.
"He was killed violent," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest has wounds caused by the knife. It has such a result in the left hand, which suggests that it tries to defend itself.
The skeleton is one of a young man between 17 and 20 years of age.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
“We can’t know if he was killed in battle or in a personal dispute,” Dowd says, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with its head pointing west.
"It was probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents that prove that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is yet another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"Has a meter 77," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, called the "Modulum Perception of Babies and Small Foods" is conducted by the University of Chicago and, so far, it has established that the young are not predisposed to eat food filled with other people or that other people have sneezed.
According to the project's financier, "appropriate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets."
There is evidence that the first dietary models of babies and young children have long-term health consequences.
The prize for this study is that the research on how babies look at food is lacking.
“Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have devoted surprisingly little attention to the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand foods,” said the financier.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have “limited knowledge in the field of food”.
Children between three and six years of age “know more about food than babies and young children,” but are “extremely mofturous consumers”.
An actress who played in "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in eastern Tennessee, being accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41 years old, who played the role of Kes in the television series, is charged with two innocent exposure offences, in which children under 13 years of age were involved, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the Sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3rd, to Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found it empty under a blanket on the couch.
Officers said that Lien refused their demands to wear.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien's got more charges, including the aggravated body injury, after the April incident in which he says that Lien entered a police car with the personal car.
You still don't know if he's got a lawyer.
Police identified the killed victim found in the Epping Forest
A man whose body in decomposition was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping Forest, north-east London.
The Turkish man of origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had connections close to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and detectives say his body was probably in the Epping forest for weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan Police, said: “Mr. Aksakal was well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the community of Green Lanes information that helps us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist spot, where there is a cafe and a boat ride lake.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area over the past few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and discuss with us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jongle Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, in the United States there is no centralised policy on maternity leave paid.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo’s executive director, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but was going to take a very short maternity leave and “work during” her time off, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superfemale or nothing.
But Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, is it to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, just got a government job in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss amazed her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," she told her boss.
But if you're going to make a family of yours in the future, grab your vacation now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a day's maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At that time, Patel was unmarried and very focused on careers, and the family was the last thing they thought about.
But she listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her medical leave days for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had collected three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when he was born the second child, Patel was unable to apply the same strategy.
The four months of vacation that he took were completely unpleasant.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of work.
“I find it very discouraging for anyone who tries to have a family,” she says.
Send a message: Your country does not put any value on being a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any woman who is a mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggle between the quality of mother and job as "a constant battle".
The secret to not being suffocated is to have "an incredible family next to you" and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that aren't going to be the best ("not everyone can be Martha to internal arrangements") and simply go through it.
Choi says she took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes it an exception, especially in her area of activity.
When your child is sick, he has a fever, he throws up and you stay up all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets really complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and noted that her investment portfolio performance had nothing to do with it.
When she entered the finance industry, after the university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
The women who quit the job, then start again don't have the same chances at top paid positions well, she says.
It is difficult to stay: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me to go on is that I would like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates the scientist and teacher Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
Children know that their mother is actually helping save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great object" in careers and fulfill it.
It's very important that women think they can have a vision.
Most don't allow themselves to believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was pregnant in eight months.
He also helped with technology, she says, because he can stop the car and answer the phone after he takes his children or respond to an e-mail from the walk.
The Jonglat between maternity and a requesting career was helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a successful end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as bons, is wrong.
"You shouldn't have luck or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, poor health system and lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't take care of each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who have just been born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to his child while he was receiving the scholarship.
With a husband and a child who were based on health care offered by the scholarship, the leader in the field of work was able to take a maternity leave for only two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining the programs established by common agreement and accepting that effective work does not mean that you should stay out of program.
In front of the constraints of logical order, says Mosko, there is the additional pressure to act in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mother's clothing" is one of the most serious insults).
“The image is part of our job – it lifts you up or pulls you down,” she explains.
Mosko's "permanent negotiation" for her multiple roles to work harmoniously means keeping her look and a nice bag in her hand, but sometimes a toy-two falls.
If he remembers that men are fathers too, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, the president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who handles the homes of over 400 000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a bit inappropriate.
It looks more like a swinger," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom only has three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important time for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant leaving early or late, so she could breastfeed her baby.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning that ends at 06:00 (“ cheaper than therapy”) is still breast-feeding.
At work, she tried to create a “friendly environment for parents”, where a child’s delay was allowed, and the response to e-mails should not be sent out of the office necessarily.
"The concept and the notion of the family have changed and changed a lot," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Some Russians say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
For the cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, Russian President, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sex minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant position on Instagram where he thanked the Russian leader for addressing him about the problem, he immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night would certainly not have been a bit.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two humorous famous Russians admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet with him or at least call him, or not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov was appointed the spokesman for the president, Dmitri Peskov.
“But it seems that Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought it was really about a conversation with the right people we gave ourselves,” he said to Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day. ”
This day and this conversation was the most wonderful and most delightful of my life.
In order to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives didn't give statements about speculative speculation.
The story is based on the comments made by the singer on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridical" attitude toward homosexuals while the LGBT rights militia in Kiev, in particular criticising a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "non-traditional sexual relations propaganda" among minors.
"I would like to meet [the Putin], to talk," John said to the BBC, saying that, although the idea was probably "unrealistic", it still deserves a try.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer raised distrust of observers when she posted a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling it.
He said that “he looked forward to meeting [the president] face-to-face to discuss the LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the other line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the jokes of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well in English, played Peskov's role and claimed that he would be the interpreter of the two.
When asked by the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told the journalists Tuesday that Putin would "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions," but that at Kremlin no such request was received from the singer.
The Kremlin had reasons to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, "especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English."
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written as well as grammatical errors.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public farce, local media channels already suspected that John had been the victim of a joke.
Some online users had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the farces made by the telephone politicians they are recording and posting on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls in a joke to public people, then publishing the recordings has become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the creator of the genre, has developed his talent to make them farce Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television by imitating Anton Gerashenko, the direct adviser of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov.
He did so well on Gerashchenko, that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoski, more than six hours in more days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections which led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
Given that Arkadi Dvorkovich, the president's adviser at that time Dmitri Medvedev convinced the chairman of the electoral committee, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, former USSR President Michael Gorbachev, the mayor of Kiev and the champion at the Vitali Klitschko box and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who had been tricked into apologizing for the drunken behavior of his athletes.
Last year Krasnov would have called Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukașenko, becoming the son of the Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanuko.
It was so convincing that the person at the end of the other, whose voice resembled Lukașenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% thought that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people die prematurely because of outdoor pollution, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, particularly in Asia, is wood and coal burning for heating houses and cooking, but research reveals that such a alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the US, where they are the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should signal the public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
These cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths per year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory disease.
Research has not included the effects of indoor air pollution, such as cooking fires, which are estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, was the first to highlight various sources of air pollution from the outside and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of using fuels that smoke, such as wood and coal, for heating dwellings or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all being recognized dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of the 645 000 deaths per year in India and a third of the 1.4 million deaths per year in China.
However, the research found that the agricultural emissions of ammonia had a “remarkable” impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of Germany’s Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of the deaths globally are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from the excessive use of fertilizers.
The ammonia reacts with traffic and industry exhaust gases and produces tiny particles, the main reason for the deaths due to air pollution in eastern America, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths globally, but could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
The pollution of air by the power plant, especially by coal-operaters, has been significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the United States, it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths per year, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in dry and dusty regions, has caused almost five of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, being responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"Suppose of high pollution and the large number of residents say their word about public health, but nothing is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health globally.
It is currently assumed that all particles are as toxic.
But if fuel-burning is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, Jerrett says, "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and political leaders".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really underlines the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia.”
Victor Ponta's statement tensions more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop with the lies, the Roman prime minister talks about attitudes that remind us of Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a border fence with Romania, after the Serbian border, have experienced a new depression following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused Budapest authorities of treating refugees "with beating and entering" on Monday.
Diplomatia ungara reacted hard by speaking about the "extreme and lying" claims, but Victor Ponta did not go any further and accused government officials from the neighboring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
Note that it is not for the first time that Ponta tries to tension Roman-Hungarian relations through statements made in delicate or electoral moments.
It all started from a statement made by Victor Ponta on Monday, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
You're the problem with our logistics to treat those people like some people, not the way our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with beatings and inserting them.
I don't agree with that.
Mr Basescu has put himself at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but we fall on the task of solving the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," Victor Ponta said on Monday, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Cehia was recently at the centre of the critics after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make the statement "extreme and liar".
The Roman business incarnate in Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, mediafax informaise, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta recently made inadequate statements on how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis," the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his moral position by means of anti-foul lies", underlined Budapest's diplomacy.
"I do not wish to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European citizen, of the mentality and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s-40s!", wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He maintains that, like other European policies, he has "duty" to attract attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of government officials of the highest level in Hungary" who are "a shame for the culture and values of the European Union" by "the anti-Semit attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Field weapons, aggressive laws, jails and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are policy-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing!", said Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially above European values", and "what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values."
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject constituted Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military went and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
The dispute also involved UDMR President Kelemen Hunor, who considers that the Roman authorities must not have a "sentimental approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The head of UDMR states that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or Roman citizens, he showed that the fence could even help our country not become an intense transit route by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, to say, that we must not hysteria, take this whole thing as something against Romania and do not have to use it to aggravate relations between the two governments anyway, because that is not the case.
I think any sentimental, visceral approach is not right.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have come here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against ours, it is not against Romania, of Roman citizens and it does not prevent free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored Russia's offer to take Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia has proposed for more than 3 years now that the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to a senior official involved at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the Western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former Finnish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers have not taken advantage of the proposal since.
From 2012 to the present, tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of the Second World War.
Ahtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also stated that during the discussions, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and the proposal addressed to Assad to give up power at some point after the beginning of peace treaties between the regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One-- we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we need to look for an elegant way for Assad to retreat," Ahtisaari said, reporting the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Great Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed to fall, that they ignored the proposal of the Russian ambassador.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," continued former President of Finland.
Officially, Russia has firmly supported Bashar al-Assad over the four and a half years of war, insisting that its incorporation cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad thinks Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and defeat the extremists of the Islamic state.

The announcement comes under the conditions under which the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online platform Antena Play, where, moreover, it was most often accessible exclusively and the recordings of the Antene broadcasts.
Reports show that the populations of marine animals and plants have halved in the last 40 years
The crisis with which animals and marine plants are faced is documented in a study that states that marine species worldwide, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures in several directions of the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a surge of difficulties for almost all marine life, says WWF’s Blue Life Plan report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while entire commercial valued fish populations, such as macro and tuna, have decreased vertigo by three quarters compared to the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical ocean forests due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction until the middle of this century if the ocean's acidity continues to worsen, as a result of increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere, which causes a directly proportional increase in the carbonic acid level in the sea.
"Healthy seas are an extraordinary source of beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, Chief Marine Policy Advisor at WWF-UK, who helped to prepare the report.
"By overfishing, which degrades coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we resemble the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the scientific literature published, but also on the Index of the living planet, a database maintained by the Zoological Society in London, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has searched for a wide variety of marine species, from fish, marine turtles and shellfish - an animal similar to a worm, with ash skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algal areas decreased by about 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundance of ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, General Director of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in fishing species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae - macro, tuna and sardines - decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without giving signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a fishing race that could end with the deprivation of people from a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Excess fishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collection of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, Scientific Director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the oceans and are a clear warning about the problems we may face as a result.”
Sea grass: deep sea “passions”, which catch rich sediments in minerals and stabilizes the sea’s bottom.
Over the past century, the cover area has declined by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of the total marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to get worse.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine change.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former partner at Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage in his autobiography in the "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that he is "not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a response, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with quoted translations attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked black people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism to him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who made himself public before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
“I don’t want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how I can go things in two,” he writes.
“It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and he doesn’t care about Liverpool at all,” he continued.
For example, the way that he spat on a huge and nasty phlegm in a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup game at Parkhead in March 2003 is a proof of his contemptuous and spiteful behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time on Anfield, his most famous night being Celtic Park.
The Senegalese advance was questioned by police after the spit episode and amended with the countervalue of his salary for two weeks at the club, the sum of 60 000 pounds being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as slow and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt that he wasn't just willing to make all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, has publicly criticized Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to the victory in the Champions League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "jelos".
“Gerrard is just jealous of me, ” he said.
He didn't touch the results that I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the chief's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the football world, the biggest football experts put me among the first seven players at the World Championship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am venerated, while Gerrard is fled whenever he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: the quick way of Alek Skallatos to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not just play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, say the producers.
“We are always looking for the most popular of the time,” said Deena Katz, the executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his printer after this.
It's charming.
He's got something special.
Before competing at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after he took a position in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler immobilized an armed man with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what might have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, the 22-year-old Skarlatos sent a message from President Obama on Twitter from Donald Trump and dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although he may have anticipated some local appreciation - on Friday in Sacramento, there was a parade in the honor of the young man - he did not expect so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in Dancing With the Stars.
"Not in a million years would I have thought I would receive this offer," said Skartos on Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show for Monday evening he acknowledged that he was "excited user", he worked as a professional at his first foxtrot, obtaining scores that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said they offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive manufacturer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free spot in the show for competitors invited on the last hundred meters, as is the case of Skartos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation who had abandoned a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skartos.
When he appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC sister program to avoid crossing all the media dams.
He supported "five-minute pain," then eagerly waited to find out if Skartos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"Once everything was very insecure, because that's so different from what he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, the fight in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he's in the mood to dance.
Skartos, who is in a short vacation from the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
She hesitated to participate, mainly because she didn't want to be just him pointed out.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their sleeve: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with his hand and his leg amputated.
They encouraged Skartos to call Galloway, the fans' favorite contestant and last season's finalist, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "following" and "persistent messages," she said.
“Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will look and how the image of my friends will be protected,” Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So after that conversation, I agreed.
Scarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, never danced until then, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he is trying to make him relax again and give up the rather rigid military position.
But Katz says he's confident that he'll adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He's gonna get a lot of love from the start, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To move on, he needs to dance.
Skarlatos, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that so far he's had fun in this completely unknown environment.
The program represented the hardest battle, being required to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was hailed in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in securing a person who attracts media attention, but it is not customary to be in the light of the reflectors, said the Wade executive manufacturer.
And the show wants to make sure the contestant manages and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"We would never want Alek to say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's hold his fists for fun.
McRib from McDonald's is back.
The time has come for those waiting all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchises in the country offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"At the McRib 2015 promotion, there are approximately 8,000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesman, Lisa McComb, told The Times in an e-mail.
In the US there are just over 14 300 restaurants of this fast food.
But according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu that they think their local customers want.
And if you still wonder what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain to her the ingredients last year, with a video that shows reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at the participating McDonald's restaurants.
There is also a website with locations serving McRib (non-affiliated to McDonald's), which may be useful.
People can report to the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant in Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight the appetite for BBQ chicken pizza.
Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones records would be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and other members of the Rolling Stones band may join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - had recently met in London and made "clear recording plans," as he says.
Tuesday evening, Richards spoke under the ICONS series of iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
At the last, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, collaborating with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on September 18th on Netflix.
This year, he released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a career of five decades.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in an earlier interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' harsh voice is a rather kinder instrument than distinguished..."
But Richards stirs emotion in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards claims that the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tour from the beginning of next year.
He hasn't given any other details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem much simpler than they actually were.
Sometimes a child actor in television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult has reaffirmed itself as a typical inexpressive in the television series "Situation of Crisis" and in films such as "Silver Spoons".
The first film he worked on as a director was a very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, as brothers with problems.
The film has as its subject a festival that seeks American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tent; the film reinterprets the story, placing the focus more on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like that before," he confessed.
In the book, the subjects and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin addressed a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of fragility and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere for months last night benefited from an introduction by the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm in particular for the sitcom "The Hogan Family" from the late 1980s and early 1990s, which he worked on. "I didn't meet many fans "Hogan Family," said Batemame sec when he climbed on the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has in the center a family named Fang.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example by putting in place a bank robbery with the academies or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is more famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who tries to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter suspect that it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children's actors who want to evolve in adult life has been directly and deeply reflected in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very typical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10, with parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
"It's a story that I feel tied up and that I understand deep," he added, "and although I didn't try to add to it my personal experience, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with an untraditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she produced the film, which obtained rights to Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-opted, who adapted his own play "Treat to reality", in which Kidman played.
Batente confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on the scene in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not participate in the premiere for months.
The author of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called the film Bateman "a clever and caustic adaptation" which "gives the tip of the much-exploited climate of the dysfunctional family and dissects the mission, sometimes from a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-loved, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and said that Bateman "provides visible progress and a greater maturity as film director with this intelligent, structured, but never too strong or mechanical adaptation".
After the month screening, when Bateman and Walken went up the stage for the question session, the audience ravaged the Walker multi-way.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe how easy it was to change between them the director work of the film, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scenes.
His concentration is indeed amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the barn, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and becomes clearer.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor discussing with Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to direct movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to take advantage of me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
Without counting that... actor wants a close-up.
During the question and answer session, Bateman confessed that, after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, as well as Carter Burwell's composer for the soundtrack.
Especially known for the long-term friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animated film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' "Carol".
"The tones elongated or obtuse seem very interesting to me," says Bateman, giving several explanations on Tuesday.
Sail through those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant public from one tone to the next during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman made yet another bold step, both as director and as actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and deciding, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman testified when he finished introducing his film to the world premiere for months, "Good, bad, he went out just as I wanted".
The festival lives like Oscars about the Boston Globe investigation story about paedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 at the loto?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered X-Lotto ticket was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15th.
Together with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 more winning entries have been recorded throughout Australia, which have divided their estimated US$4 million X-Lotto prize fund.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought X-Lotto tickets at Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto extraction 3555 Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is looking forward to getting the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his X-Lotto ticket.
"We have tried hard to spread the news, because a person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Detectives from forensics are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the last man Daniel Hind was seen.
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his life the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd search the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Miss Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened with her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half I think he's not.
Whatever it is, we want it home and put an end to the stories.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 km of new highways and repair 17 000 km of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of the works for the motorways Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina, all being part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure enhanced road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods from Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking in cultural goods stolen from the Middle East, thanks to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the theft of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was restored to suit the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on the prevention of smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
Bulgaria has said it is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed third place, after Italy and Greece, on top of the traffic in objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's Interior Minister has also shown that trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has become widespread, being described as a very serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova, noted that footage of the illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war-stricken country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rockedyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be modified if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements on the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal shares for launch rockets of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the bid is a strategic move of Aerojet to defeat its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the Amazon.com founder, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
ULA says that the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine from Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet contradicts.
Work on new engines became a priority after American legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of American military or spying satellites, after the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to match both the Atlas 5 missile of ULA, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan missile that develops the ULA and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a new engine and a completely new rocket, as it is currently going to ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet was planning to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed then by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of the fiscal year 2016, beginning in October.
She also claims that the entire company was eager to see how the Air Force would share a funding of approximately $160 million among rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was thinking of trying other private engine financing options, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
The brewing company AB InBev intends a merger worth $275 billion with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer-producing company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) on a takeover that would form a colossal one that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev' domination in Latin America with the SABMiller in Africa, both representing fast-growing markets and with their Asian beer factories.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland of the Society General said.
AB InBev and other top beer-producing companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the two-world company and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, according to British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its cost-cutting policy on marketing score, previously orchestrated the purchase of Burger King, Ketchup manufacturer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what it's going to do, since they didn't get any offers.
"At this moment, we are in the phase we wait and decide," the source said.
Speculations of a merger, which would most likely cause concerns about the breach of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for several years.
The time of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August onwards.
"It's exactly the time they were waiting for," said analyst Phil Gorham at Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller action, maybe even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would make the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases in 1980.
The SAB shares approached 19.9% to 36.14 pounds, giving him a US$90 billion stock capitalization.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could search for another merger as defense strategies, as happened the previous year when it offered to buy Heineken, but it failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle bottle of refreshing drinks with the Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination with Diageo or with the Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global market share of AB InBev, the manufacturer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was in 2014 of 21.1%, while SABMiller was 15%, according to the experts in Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a relationship between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) twice from the current 2.5.
It is possible to achieve the goal in 2016, the nearest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so it would have a way of borrowing to finance an acquisition.
When he bought Budweiser’s production company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with $52 billion, the largest purchase of ice money in history at that time. he left the report to grow more than 5 times.
Such a big climb would allow them to raise a debt of 100 billion.
The families who control AB InBev own a little more than half the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the producer of Altera cigarettes (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altraa refused to make statements on the fact that they were approached by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that he regularly assesses investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that keeping assets is in the interests of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European investment, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, who holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debt reaches some 15%.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage, 8%, after 10 years," said Dwane.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the breach of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"The economies that could be done with distribution operations are large, and the obstacles to the breach of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the holding company held by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to obtain another 8 percent and appoint a new company executive director.
Molson, with headquarters in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the rest of the 50 percent.
A Molson spokesperson refused to comment if the company was interested in an auction, but Molson’s shares increased by over 12 percent to their highest value.
Any merger may also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the SABMiller’s SABS Snow RC Association with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could hold a 28% share of the global market after concessions.
AB InBev is counseled by Lazard, and SABMiller is counseled by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuses a former Air Force pilot of having helped Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would subsequently donate funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who support the activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban troops at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
It also influenced two militants involved in a May attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and Israeli, following which 45 people died, said to journalists senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for Combating Terrorism of the Province.
It will be charged with the financing of terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has funded Afghan Taliban more, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," said the officer.
"In addition, Ahmed has also provided financial aid for AQIS," he said, referring to the organization Al Qaeda of the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, who face activism, corruption and crime.
After the Taliban in December massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to suppress activism.
Hard attacks have occurred, while the army has also sent more in tribal regions outside the law of the border with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have supporters from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces prepared and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, aged 52, used to preach to a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in Sargodha and left the Pakistan Air Force in 1998, said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
It subsequently entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross has rejected his copyright application for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
The New York Rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Federal Court of Miami, District Judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, the prominent part of his 2006 debut score, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' judgment weakens the process for violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duet of Los Angeles, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous songs in 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin' song".
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" song in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling t-shirts and other products with the shufflin' slogan.
In his judgment on Tuesday, Williams says that "Hustlin', as a melody, is protected by the law of copyright.
But Ross' three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared him to other famous lyrics from the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying that it is "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared to be impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether LMFAO's song is an unauthorized copy of Hustlin'.
The process is scheduled for October.
The lawyers of Ross and LMFAO could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., at the U.S. district court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson approached the bomb leader Donald Trump in the pre-public elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush went down in seven-point polls.
After Trump's 27% support in the most recent CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, by TV star Mike Huckabee, by Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
The support of Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, governor of Ohio John Kasich and former CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, in numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one who goes on with Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last poll, Walker support is 2%.
Carson attracted greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university voters (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined which candidate to support in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said they knew who they were going to vote were twice as much behind Trump as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT poll conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public Tuesday, before a presidential debate.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects that of Senator Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of the presidential Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to the presidential nominations of the CBS shows that Sanders rose by 10 points and by 22 points in Iowa, in New Hampshire, respectively, among the Democrats for preliminary voting.
A leading ethical specialist says that sex robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sex thefts seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models they inspire - the way they show, what roles they will play - are very disturbing,” she said to BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said to Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to an increase in sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are now manufacturing are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it in the face.
Surely, the industry seems to be winding up.
A few years ago, the company producing inflatable dolls True Companion launched Roxxxy, "the world's first sexual robot".
However, concern about the possible high dangers of artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the great representatives of industry.
Just this spring, Tesla Motors’ executive director, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that in five years something really dangerous will happen.
In an interview with BBC in December last year, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
United Kingdom welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the following days, the Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, announced the Interior Minister Theresa May.
They will receive assistance under the extended re-installation programme of the government.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps on the border with the war-stricken country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said the government "is working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that they are already given the assistance and support they need and deserve.
I know that the honourable members and the general public want to learn more about the number of persons and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is going well.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the Chamber aware of this.
But I am delighted to tell the House that we are waiting to welcome the first wave of refugees in the next few days and are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew his anger from parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the plan for government refugees, many of whom felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the following general elections.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that allows them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal Democratic Parliamentary Paddy Ashdown said that the measures were "derogations".
Also, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they reach 18 years of age if they do not receive asylum.
Important public figures and personalities have also condemned measures.
In a joint letter, big names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis was "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that needs to be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown into the shoulders of countries close to conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is based on the background of global insecurity - RT Business
The Russian ruble was strengthened on Wednesday, being traded 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble was due to the investor's reaction to the current disturbances of the global market produced by the weights of China, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's contributions increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at 45.31 USD per barrel.
MORE CITITES: Most likely, interest rate will grow in the US by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that volatility may say its word, fuelled by insecurity in China and at the time of the rise in the federal interest rate, which will continue to add to the tone for oil and rubble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys of Rabobink, expert in strategy for monetary policies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lucoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
Global markets await the decision of Thursday's Federal Reserve, whether or not it will increase interest rate.
Markets consider that what could be the first increase in the US interest rate in nine years will not happen and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration is the result of a widespread anxiety about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial planes.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in live colours.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," says research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to the Detta O'Cathain, Baroness from the House of Lords, concern has grown on the background of reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and drone operation above football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"Over 400 calls to the metropolitan police over the past two years have been related to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: to build a system to track all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
“As more and more small drones operate commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the driver’s visibility level, or even completely autonomous flights, some air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as delivery of parcels in cities,” she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods of avoiding unfavourable weather and wind conditions, congestion management, road planning and redirection by methods similar to the rules established for road traffic, such as signaling and banding.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is exploding into the European Union in the coming years.
"We already see small and innovative SME companies in the United Kingdom that use this technology with significant effects on the energy, agriculture and the media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 commercial drone permits were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: Why Facebook wants to know what makes you sad
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook value - approximately $240 billion after the last statistics - is due to the amount of unimagined consumer data it holds.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable image of complexity, found in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is valuable primarily for advertising agents, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their ads on Facebook by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A empathy button adds another data set and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who “appreciate” a national football team, charitable organizations and promoters want to address those who, for example, “imitate” with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that enormous universe of content that you could see, in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you considered interesting in the past and, in particular, on what you liked.
Undoubtedly, there is on Facebook fear that many interesting, but unhappy, posts do not go into algorithms, because people do not feel that they should appreciate them.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it could make the decision to eliminate these kinds of posts from News.
Facebook has conducted in the past experiments to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how it is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic environmental representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple trial of Facebook (and published open, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The truly exciting thing is the way that the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can result in so much speculation.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made on Facebook - either involve the visible buttons that we see or invisible algorithms that operate hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and one that carries on a constant fight for survival in the ferocious Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions he makes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the ones considered most suitable to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in persons with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that the body signals can anticipate these, sometimes violent, changes before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say he's in pain with his head or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is transmitting to us, and we need to do that in a gentle and intrusive way.
For example, simple viewing of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving to the assistant that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The data in the brackets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team would work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Customer Services at Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the 2015 Autech conference on Autism and Technology at Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we work, you see the spectacular difference that they can make in terms of their life assistive technology. Now, apps for iPad give, in itself, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the autistic kids learn to play hide-and-seek.
"Who knows where this innovation might lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organization for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and is also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the following weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air strikes on Syrian targets Isis, announced on Wednesday the government, only a few days after President François Hollande declared that the intervention was a "necessary".
France will launch the first air strikes on the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria "in the following weeks," defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
The French Air Force is conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow “in the following weeks as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian said for the France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
"In the town of the Sea there is an extremely powerful offense, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that has bombarded Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Holland has changed the strategy last week to expand its actions in Syria, under the conditions of political pressure it accumulates on the basis of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
IOS 9 advertising block feature will make your phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of ads while using the Safari browser mobile version of Apple.
On the test, it was proved that, after blocking advertisements, news sites such as the New York Times are charging twice as fast as Reuters.
It also helps users to maintain their use of the data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising locking tool, launched its own iOS web browser that limits advertisements; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use advertising blocking software are experiencing some constraints.
Advertising is still being displayed in applications (this is where Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers grew to nearly 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for the online media, which is largely offered free of charge to consumers and has been supported by advertising for many years.
A report says that blocking advertisements could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in advertising revenues just this year.
In order to turn on blocking ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application to block advertisements, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama welcomed King Felipe VI of Spain to the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various subjects, but they probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king addressed the issue of the struggle against the Islamic state and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which already faces hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in recent months.
Obama also emphasized the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which Catalonia's Spanish territory will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"With regard to foreign policy, we have firmly committed to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Philip that he would like to visit his country before the end of his mandate in 2017.
“We welcome you with open arms,” Felipe replied.
First lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a tea talk.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States from climbing to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were about to make a visit to South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins the Luke Cage series
The famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the distribution of the future Netflix Luke Cage from Marvel. She will be an antagonist to Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero giving the title to the show.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and cousin of Cornell character "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change to the streets he grew up," says a press release.
Her personal life and professional career are given over by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, and her cousin Cottonmouth's infamous actions.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the leadership role of the Harlem community," says Jeph Loeb, the executive producer and president Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will be premiered in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as a showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, 62 years old, is known for TV Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Desperate Nieves and Law Firm, but also for the movies Devil's Advocate, Mystery, The Family That Preys, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series in the Netflix franchise.
Also soon will be broadcast Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have world premiere on the same day
Fox provides many positive results before the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season in Queens and the second season in Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the domestic premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is a trend for high-profile series, as traffic in global social networks guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series he talks about, such as Empire and Scream Queens," said the president of Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We're just waiting to broadcast these very interesting shows for fans around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series at the premiere and throughout its life cycle.
The next season in Empire, where they will play famous stars like Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the premiere in September.
The new Scream Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the next day, in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will participate in the World premiere of the film "Spectre"
Prince Harry and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will participate next month in London in the world premiere of the latest film with James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news on Wednesday on Twitter, appointing the premiere as the Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as the 1946 RFP.
In the past, for the royal premieres have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th, at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, after which will benefit workers from the backstage of the British film and television industry.
The premiere will also participate in the film distribution, including the main actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spect" will be broadcast in cinemas in the United States in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and musician John Melencamp were seen on Monday having dinner together, poking out the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photographers surprised Brinkley happy and smiling.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken blouses, coats and boots.
Last year, in October, Melencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who was disengaged and who was constantly at war with, the actress Meg Ryan.
Melencamp praised the message star for you at the NBC's Today show, saying it was "an angel who was sent to me and I'm very happy."
He added that "nothing ends until it ends".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailors Brinkley Cook, posed for Seventeen's magazine, trampling on her mother's tracks.
The kings of Arctic mosquitoes are big enough to take off a karibu
Many studies have shown that species have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proven to be a benefit to others.
One of these advantaged species is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the mosquitoes here to appear earlier and grow higher, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding from Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes in terms of an increase of 2 degrees Celsius of temperature.
They are small, but they represent important members of the Arctic and ecosystem trading chain.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biology anticipate better how a growing population of mosquitoes could affect the karibu with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, Dartmouth scientists combined their results from the field with the results of laboratory experiments that investigated how temperature influences insect development and predisposition to be hunted by predators.
While increasing temperature makes the mosquitoes more vulnerable in front of the coleopters, it also provides them a early start in the spring and makes their larvae develop faster and more efficient, which is, of course, an advantage.
More mosquitoes are a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that insect feed can sustain it.
The ability of mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that antidepressants in pregnant women have no effect on the development of their children's neural or behavioral development.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, which should therefore be treated.
"These studies add to an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said a press release John Thorp, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, evidence thus far appears to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those of antidepressants administration.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of motors of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian cohort study of mother and child, researching the effects of using SSRI for the development of motor skills at the age of 3 years.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy and 159 of them had been treated with drugs for an extended period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not so significant as to give rise to clinical importance".
A group of researchers from Adelaide University in Australia conducted an examination of the data for 49 000 women in Danish National birth cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behaviour of children up to 7 years of age.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of the children whose mothers had been treated against SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared with 231 children who were more prone to behaviour issues such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization issues.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more prone to post-birth bleeding if treated with SSRI.
The analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers have said that, although the study linked the use of increased risk of SSRIs, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information obtained by researchers about women's specific medical conditions - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and that is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Based on this study alone, we do not recommend that women stop taking medicines against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of potential bleeding as much as possible.
Matthew is put on charges for murder in case of the murder of a student at the Virginia Technical University
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham student at Virginia University was charged for a qualified murder in the case of a student at the lost Virginia Technical University in 2009, announced Tuesday.
The great jury in Albimarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33, Charlottesville, for killing Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum life sentence.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of impeachment has brought them relief.
"For six years we've been working determined and relentlessly for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm thrilled to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your doing.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be laid down.
Police say there is an illegal medical connection between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 Fairfax County sexual abuse.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for the latter and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with a qualified murder in case of a student's death at Virginia University
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, with his friends at a metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a cab around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with Pantera's band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends started an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of teaching studies, who wanted to become a teacher.
In November 2009, his shirt was found next to a chain of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lanna, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
In the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period overlaps with the date that Harrington disappeared.
Police say that a significant advance in the course of Harrington's case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said that these cases are related by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not momentarily publicize the details of the new evidence that led them to put Matthew on charges for Harrington's murder.
Defense counsel, Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to give statements.
Announcement of the indictment comes two days after the completion of a year since Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both of them were young students who disappeared when they were out in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18-year-old from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a downtown mall near U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first few days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and views organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter's speculations and media critics who must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"During all this time there have also been discussions like "Why are we wearing short skirt?" and "Why are we looking for it with candles?" but such questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the tracks of the hunt," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who at the time of the attack was 26 years old, told the jurors that one September evening while returning home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a green area, beat her up and held her by the neck, then attacked her sexually.
“I was thinking that my end had come, that I had to scream unstoppably,” the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly took her on the run, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jurors that Matthew might have been scared of the lights of a car entering a parking lot nearby.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will be sentenced in October.
Matthew will come to Harrington's trial for the first time in Charlottesville Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he'd most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"Something, today I've taken a step before," says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the fate of the character or of the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew the duration of the contract or the HBO post, according to Digital Spy.
Asked over a few seasons, he said he couldn't talk about it.
Let's just say that the series will be part of my life for some time, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave Games of Thrones, then will be the time when I bury myself in film-length projects," said the actor.
The series returns to small screens in the spring of next year.
Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of the fourth season, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched various theories, according to which he will somehow be brought back to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called "Jon Snow's Dome", 40 days after the end of the season, which has reached over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume the payments for Romania under the 'Economic Competitiveness' and 'Media' programmes, both initiated in early April 2015.
According to a statement by the Representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this decision, approximately 120 million euros will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the immediate period following.
I am pleased to be able to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts of the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems under the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weak points and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the actions taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the Hungarian diplomat replied.
Peter Szijjarto asked European socialists to stop the "false campaign" at Hungary.
Referring to statements made by Harlem Desir, French State Secretary for European Affairs on the Hungarian fence, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "maintains a common European immigration strategy", but insisting that national borders must be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World

The refugee crisis: without any solution
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that Thursday he will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union Summit on Migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called on Tuesday to organise a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot handle the refugee crisis alone.
The German Chief Executive expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive influx of asylum seekers, stating that the measure is intended to facilitate refugee registration.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redeploy refugees between Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organize an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Interior Ministers, meeting on Monday evening in Brussels, failed to adopt the new proposal for urgent redistribution of 120,000 refugees between the Member States of the European Union, submitted on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the emergency resettlement mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again challenges controversy, after publishing cartoons that mock the answer of the predominant Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the predominantly Muslim countries affected by war.
In its most recent issue, the publication attracted attention again, as well as criticism on social networks, says Reuters.
One of the drawings infacts a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy, whose body reached one of the beaches of Turkey, after a successful attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's design shows a child in short pants and shirts, with a face down on the grand court, next to a billboard that offers two children's menus at the price of one.
"As close as possible," is the message that accompanies the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the Paris editorial office in January, is accompanied by the message "Davada as Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who walks on the water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up in the water, first saying "Christians go on the water," takes the second "Muslim kids drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after it was intended to attack Islamists in January as a result of repeated threats to the prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, dramatically amended in Russia
The French Supermarket Seat Auchan was fined more than $370,000 by Russian officials, charged with food security breaches.
Anna Popova, the head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rospotrebnadzor, said that the fines totalize over 25 million rubles, that is, $372,000, relates the Associated Press agency, quoted by US News.
The reasons for these fines were not specified, and Auchan made no comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the target of the Russian agriculture agency's accusations, which claim that some meat products have been detected as infested with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food checks come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the extension of the European Union sanctions and the French decision to annul an agreement on the provision of Mistral Russia vessels.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a fair political gesture.
MAE showed, in a communiqué given to the editorial office Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced to the public.
On its own behalf, the Commission informed Romania’s competent decision-making factors in relation to this situation in due course of time.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two Member States of the European Union and who are strategic partners is not a fair political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian side, it is also shown in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax, Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary to ensure that the traffickers who pass Serbia change their routes, and there is a chance that they will move to Romania," the chief of Hungarian diplomacy explained.
"The Guard would begin at the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the migration pressure moves to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing Serbian territory on the way to the European Union tried to walk around the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern edge, at the commune border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, non-EU immigrants have discovered that they can run the fence through the areas of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion fork (EUR 71.8 million) for the construction of a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometers, and for the special centres needed for immigrant cases.
The guard's initiative is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor's unscrupulous body will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite his desire in this sense expressed by the widow of the politician.
According to a communication given to Ziare.com, the Permanent Bureau of the Senate discussed, Tuesday, a request from Mrs. Vadim Tudor, on the approval of the uninsumbated body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor at the Senate Headquarters.
"From receiving this letter until the moment of the analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninsumbled body has already been deposited to a cult-house and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau appreciating that there is no need to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate transmits.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in agreement with the geographical position of Romania somewhere in Europe".
It also transmits Agerpres, the senators held a moment of recollection in memory of the former PRM leader, to the proposal of Senator UNPR Serban Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died on Monday evening around 18:30.
The president of the PRM passed away at the Army's Emergency Clinical Center for Cardiovascular Diseases.
The European Parliament will be buried at the Ghencea cemetery on Thursday from 12:00, and will have military honors.
Are refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors of the border communities, questions about accommodation
The mayors of the border localities of Arad county are questioned by the Border Police and Police, these days, about the accommodation places for any refugees that might reach Romania, but also for the gendarmi, if they will be mobilized at the border.
Nadlac’s editor Vasile Ciceac said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted including with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with the border police, the National Police and the local police, as well as the farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I've asked the farmers, who have work at this time on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the editor said.
Immigrants ’ Crisis in Hungary: Armoured and granite water cannons
He, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police asked for information on available accommodation sites in the case of a refugee wave.
We've been asked how many people we can hunt.
We in the commune don't have room for refugees.
We believe that such special centres do not even have to defend at the border, because they are harder to control here, migrants being tempted to escape, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to establish such centres in areas farther away from the border," the mayor of the municipality of Iratosu, Papp Atila Joseph, said.
On the other hand, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he had been asked as much accommodation for refugees as for intervention forces, in case they would be mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt and fjordarms.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no chance of accommodation.
"We've been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "starting on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has been permanently established".
"There's always a police officer on the job, and the locals know they need to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," said the editor.
The Pilu Mayor's representatives said that at least a hundred people could be accommodated on the Cultural Road, the information being provided to the police at their request.
Also, the mayor of Curtici City, Nicolae Aanitea, said there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public finances, but here are necessary arrangements.
A former Border Police barracks could also be arranged to host refugees.
The representatives of the police office of the Judete Arad did not offer a view on the question of mayors during this period, confirming only that "in the border localities of Arad county patrol activities have been intensified".
Commander of the Army Club announces radical measures against Becali's Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announced a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two parties have negotiated a standstill, Boroi maintains that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical palm of the "ros-albrastri".
The team that won the Champions Cup is in peace for now.
"It's not a historical break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change from next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process that requires damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period at which we refer by deciding ICCJ is clearly established.
We have to recover the damage from the FC Star, the team that used the Star brand without the acceptance of the owner - i.e. CSA Stara.
It appears very clearly and the continuity of the sect, which was actually permanent to the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfomats it has so far in palm trees," says George Boroi.
The Star of Becali and the Army Club are in wars opened from the end of last year, when the supreme court decided that the military are the ones who hold the mark "Steaua".

Region that "gets" millionaires
The Asia-Pacific millionaires will form, this year, the richest people in the world, thanks to the accumulated assets in China and India, show a study published on Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the assets of the millionaires in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a combined fortune of $16,200 billion, transmits AFP.
The study specifies that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are the people who can invest at least a million dollars, regardless of the value of real estate and other possessions.
"In the future, HNWI's wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets coming from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," is shown in the study by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India represent almost 10% of HNWI's global wealth and are responsible for 17% of the global increase in new assets after 2006.
China, the second economy of the world after the US, had in 2014 a number of $890,000 with a combined wealth of $4,500 billion, increasing by 17.5%, or 19.3%, compared to 2013.

"Dorel" mounted the mist
At Suceava, the workers mounted a low-up light so instead of being aware that they have to wait for 4 seconds, the passers-by gets the message "h", which they don't know how to decipher.
It's not a bath, everyone else passes on the red, informs the truth.
Each one passes the way he cuts off his head.
Two guys were gonna be picked up by a car because they passed the red.
"The politicians at the Route should be here to help, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the quoted source.
The lighthouse was recently mounted in front of the Big Stone in central Suceve, but the passers-by seem not to want to take account of it, as much as the information received seems to be inconceivable.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did his job properly and found someone responsible enough to give his ok for the completion of the work, then it would not have come to this absurd situation.
The head of the Strazi Administration and Route Systemization Service of Suceava Primary recognize with canades that it was from the front when the traffic lights started working, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We used them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was in the front when they were put into operation," Stefan Vasincu said, promising that the problem will be fixed in the shortest time.
Thank God it can be repaired, because there are situations in which "Dorel" has done irreparable ravages.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under Dunare, there is no known where, probably under the ground, buried, anyway, he was not found, as even supported the Minister of Economy, Mihai Totuse.
The police put water cannons on immigrants
On Wednesday, Hungary’s main border with Serbia’s Hungarian Granices used water and tear-gas cannons against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the Sarbo-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees, says The Guardian.
The water cannons were put into operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the barbed wire fence through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
The Hungarian police maintain that the action of the cannons was a control measure of the crowd, which was throwing bottles of water.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people cry after the use of tear gas.
The publication Elena Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refused to deliver Hungarian chili sarma.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced her intention to raise one and the border with Romania, a strongly criticized initiative in Bucharest.
The German companies claim that the constipated sarma is very dangerous and provoke cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military facilities, but should not be used against people seeking shelter, support companies.
At the same time as the Hungarian border clashes, Croatia has mobilized to place at the disposal of the immigrants buses to transport those present at the country border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, also reported the Ministry.
Tsipras, on the drama of Greece - why he agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The aim of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader Syriza made part of a third loan agreement for this country in Greece, which also involves several years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which conducts an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras is asking the Greeks to re-entrust the prime minister's mandate, as part of the elections they hold to strengthen their political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not to get it out of the euro area or break up the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," former Prime Minister Elen said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the view that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the Elen Government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras says that Greece certainly needs reforms," specifying that it needs to start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 months of storming at the head of the Athens Executive, the period when a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.

Star Trek's actress, in prison because she undressed in front of some kids.
Actress Jennifer Lien, known as Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intrusing Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she was from September 3rd - the search being fixed at $2,500 - took place in front of her house in Tennessee.
The vision started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his children who was crying, reports Mirror.
At one point, during the dispute, the actress lifted her shirt, showing her bust, so that then, before entering the house, she would take off her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was forcibly taken to the car.
It's not the first time the 41-year-old actress has trouble with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then making herself guilty even of the attack.
Jennifer went into Kes's skin in 1995, after he appeared in "American History X", a film in which he also played Edward Norton.
He gave up acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She is married to the writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
They're taken in sight with the West machine gun.
You're not supporting terrorism anymore!
Syrian President Bashar al Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he speaks on behalf of refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorism and of "visaging" immigrants.
"The West cries for them and the West supports terrorism at the beginning of the crisis, when it says this is a panic revolt," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus maintains that his western counterparts say about the situation in Syria as it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it is not about the fact that Europe has not accepted them or embraced them as refugees, it is about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, they don't support terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the entire refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued his accusations to Western states and in what regard to their treatment of refugees.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with one eye and takes a look at them with the second eye machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorism and crime, and in the second direction because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of the infrastructure, you won't have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar al Assad.
"If we asked any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should unite around what the Syrian people want".
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the dialogue in the country should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "only if we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because it is how we can achieve the political goals that we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action," Bashar al Assad said.
He also talked about one of his country's allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the Ukraine crisis, he was transformed from the friend of the West to his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West again of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the coup in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a country.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses Russia's opposition and has come to power through undemocratic means, despite the fact that it was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, they're not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader of Damascus pointed out.
Not last, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
On the other hand, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "they can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, the Syrian president accused the "international coalition", led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand".
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the field.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide a cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will intrude - then we have no objection to cooperating with all these countries, considering it's a real and not false coalition that fights against terrorism," the leader of Damascus said.
Autumn?
Not at all.

They will register 31 degrees at Satu Mare, 29 at Zalau, 30 at Cluj Napoca, 31 at Oradea, 28 at Alba Iulia, 30 at Arad, Timisoara and Caransebes.
The sky will be clear and in the east, where meteorologists announce 27 degrees to Botosani, 25 to Suceava, 23 to Piatra Neamt, 26 to Iasi, Vaslui and Bacau, 25 to Focsani and 26 to Galati.

Map of the countries with the greatest cheap and how Romania stays
The collapse of the oil quota has caused major losses in the last year of the workers in the title extract, the shareholders of the energy companies and the countries that depend very much on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has gone down enormously.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, from October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all 76 countries considered, the price of fuel fell.
The most important price reduction at the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine cost 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs less than a dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, changes in the taxation, but also fluctuations in the currency rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data showed that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
Thus, we ranked 27 in the country with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position on the top.
The girl of the last quarter of 2014, gas was also cheap in the Romans.
Then the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a price reduction of 10.6%.
However, the surrounding countries stand even better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of petrol costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Nemthians set up the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to the 16 federal lands in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country throughout southern Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with prime ministers from the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to deal with the large number of refugees," says the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 seats for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"These are necessary pivot points," she pointed out.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The Prime Ministers of the Land requested more aid than the €6 billion agreed to by the federal government coalition more than a week ago.
Thuringia Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party requested a "the least double amount, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In his turn, the Prime Minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be rapidly integrated into the German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for the bureaucracy in the handling of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Land Prime Minister Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria has carried the most heavy burden, with the most migrants arrived after they crossed the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into a public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual door policy opened at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after the humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve carriage at the end of the Real Madrid game, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach was totally disturbed by the arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost his education was disadvantaged.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I wish to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the major teams in Europe, we are always disadvantaged of arbitration.
They're two totally different ways.
We were given a yellow cardboard immediately, while the top teams didn't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any way!
The ball hit Darijo in the back, without touching his hand.
A level game should not have been influenced by arbitration.
"Regreed that the arbitration broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what smells so ugly here"?
There were pieces of the cut-off husband
A murder of a sadism coming out of the community terrified the inhabitants of Targu Fremos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Targu Fremos were able to see terrifying scenes near the main entry into the market.
Next to the three caskets, the killers "sampled" from the pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
He was cut off, but his head, internal organs, and genitals were missing.
In the end, it had to prove that it was the body of an ex-officer, who had been cut off by his wife, professor of geography.
The "Iasian day" stood to speak on lines even with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing, at the path of the sacks with the broken body.
His stories make your hair dirty.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman with three bags that were horrifying, after the pieces of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from Targu Nices.
As in American films, the man helped himself to transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but not knowing, the killer being a customer for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for the "Iasi Day", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide evidence.
He carried with his hands the sack in which the body parts of the teacher's husband of geography, which he had cut off, were found.
She had come to Targu Fremos to hide the evidence of the crime, as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe he's got mine.
I didn't know how you knew.
Nea Mihai, as is known by her friends who practice taximetry in Targu Fremos, has become a star overnight in the little town she lives in.
He's seen American films throughout his life, but he never thought he'd ever get to be himself who's going to be at the root of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and he'll see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It tells us that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, it usually expects the arrival of the buses passing regularly the town.
It is close to the intersection of the roads to Roman and to the Pacific.
The taxi driver tells us that the killer woman observed it in the rear-view mirror next to the bag with the body parts supported by the indicator showing nearby localities.
She came on the night of Massaro's race, from 1.30.
The coach left her ten meters from passing pedestrians from the Pashcans, just to the bottom where the mileage shows.
Sacii were listed by signboard with the indicator.
After he left the bus, I gave him ten yards to march up to her.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here?"
I saw that she's an old woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, at the disposal, maybe he has lambs, I didn't know where to know.
I've thought maybe he wanted to scratch someone with that smelly ugly meat.
She was trying to pick up a single bag, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He has specified me to take her to the big market gate, when I took her from the bus," he began to tell us to Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He filled out that the woman didn't say anything at all, and as a result he was no longer curious to ask her something.
Until the destination, I didn't talk at all, because I was nervous that he put my thief in the car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that it smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I went back into the car, I took two meters back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and I moved the car over and over here to disappear the smell.
On the bus I didn't notice if someone was helped down the bags, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see well in the mirrors.
"It was two bags of plastic and one bag of raffia," completed the man.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she started to drive her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something's wrong.
After giving his bags down, I went to the hospital, to the City Hall, and when I came back, I looked especially at what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She had been hauling the luggage after the fence in time, where there are the dumpsters inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little bit of excitement because a bus from Italy and a bus arrived.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very nervous, she walked over and over.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he walked and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I saw her a while ago.
I looked them up and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them she was a suspect.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," completed Nea Mihai.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after leaving the luggage at the dumpsters.
To me, the suspicion left from the fact that the luggage was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed me, telling her that I had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid his bags around 3 o'clock, when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," his cabimetric account ended.
The Neamt prosecutors, those investigating the case, say that the 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras of a Roman gas station at 0.55, climbing with the three bags on the bus.
She arrived at Targu Nice at 1.30.
According to investigators, she would have killed the husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then locked him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was an officer in reserve.
On Sunday night, the woman put the body parts in two bags of plastic, which she transported to the bus station, and hid them.
Last night, he transported another one, then decided in which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, the prosecutors still didn't know where she hid the woman's internal organs from her husband, nor the genitals.
The head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, however, in a woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors did not find out from the woman who was the reason why he killed his husband with such cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychically expert, and the body will be examined by the forensics, to officially determine the cause of death and possible other relevant details.
The city took national roads from the city after years had been taken over by the Government, in order to be financially asphalted from the national budget in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the local Council (CL), and in order to be able to be implemented, a decision must be taken by the Government.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a matter for the latter to give the opinion for the General Banystic Ur Plan (PUG).
The city hall took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that pass through the municipality.
No opinion may be delivered from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government will have to be issued as a result of this Local Council decision," the Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica said.
National roads surrounding the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
National road 28 beats the Iash on the arteries: the Route Păcurari, rue Munteni (to be mafor), Moara de Fire, Straupagea Silvestru, rue Silvestru, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Priverii, Calea Chisină, the Route Teutțora until the exit of the municipality to Tomești - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the road Bucium, bd. Socola (up to the traffic lights), Bucium street (up to the base 3), Chisinau Road, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In addition to the description of the "file" of the political sympathies of the young Mircea Eliade who, however condensed, would have presented the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, merit, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehement charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "antilegionary", would have to start in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analysing the criticisms of the various versions that spoke of the recording of Elijah in the Legion through the Cube of "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin Tourcanu brings to the discussion, in the volume Mircea Elias.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree of understanding of the replay of epistolary contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "the balcony scene" in August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the Security investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, Folder 573, f.15) as well as on a follow-up note in 1938, Florin Tourcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in such a so-called "legion family" called Luminita, a group of "cuiburs" of intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
Since there is no verifiable data on the light nest, those in exile considering the existence of this debatable "legislative family", what needs to be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded on the record.
Leaving it to a surprising part of the SRI's kindness to make these secret dossiers available to Mr.Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the pursuit of Security was "the commander" Radu Gyr, the mention of Elijah being made, as of March 21, 1938, in the context in which Armand Călinescu, the Interior Minister received free hand to take all necessary measures so that King Carol could impose his royal dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the political force of legionaries who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All Party for the Third Country in the 1937 elections).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Tourcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legislative Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a subtle bureaucratic cover for the repression in 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at re-election for the vast majority of legionaries or supporters active in the public space who were to be arrested, but who had to be linked to an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holographic statement recalled above, in February 1941, after the fall of the legionation rebellion, only confirms retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police, authoritarian regime.
It would have been interesting if Turucanu had provided more details on the contents of the quoted 573 file.
Was the file written to Eliade or Radu Gyr?
Because it must be a dossier built on the basis of the Safety documents anyway, but then processed by Security to be used either against the other one or the other.
It is here an error, as is the case with the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows about the formation of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that he is a pre-emptive stage, of proof, in which the person in question acts as an active sympathizer, who is in the trial period of three years before becoming "camerad" with acts all right.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or cenacles, sedentaries, discussion groups with the peasants, youth organisations or students gravitated around a nest, were his "family", were not his own nest said, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the undressed reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which may be plausible) to be understood and used ad litteram to designate the political registration in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of subtleties of interpretation of this type cannot conceal the public activity of support of the Guard and the clear sympathy for the Captain who enlivened Elijah in the period 1935-1940, whether in the bosom of Nae Ionescu or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and proper political registration is all the more said by the fact that, normally, intellectuals of this size retain a type of superiority in the face of activists as such and does not enter into politics until they are given direct high privileges.
As much as I could have formed an opinion on the type of Elijah's thinking from that time, when he was the "leader of the young generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigor of a legional nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
In order not to mention, but in the past, the fact that, in any legionary "file", what they receive is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Elijah, even to new evidence.
As for Elias-Gyr's correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Elias, tries to sanctify the claims of Florin Tourcanu (based on some archival documents, even if it deserved more dissected and contextualized) with a still questionable argument.
Mircea Handoca notes, in the New Volume on Mircea Eliade (Bucuresti, 2006), that "not one line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any reference to this frame".
There was no way that in 1968, when, having emerged somewhat alive from the communist ocne, Radu Gyr could not have risked any allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think meant to underline Mircea Handoca was that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah's ascendancy.
There's really no even the worst suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been head of Eliade.
Cleverly, the poet obliged to write to Glasul Patria, dedicates his place to the embarrassing condition by pointing out to Eliade (who knew exactly what mission he had that publication that was constantly dealing with denigration of the right exile), in signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visible relieved and happy when he responds affectionately after almost three decades of separation since the "time viclean" took him away.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" he was charged with (to convince Elias that now, in the new Romania, he could at least return quietly to see his mother and friends) and that, skilledly, he fulfils his dryness and short sentences, divided by paragraphs, to suggest their foreign body character, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, suggested refined political complicities or any evocation of the years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legionary line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin Tourcanu, we have in this memory correspondents who confess a reciprocal price of characters who have marked different, but stately, our culture and who, beyond the severe trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbelical education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, predators for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the destiny "under the time" of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally gave up his refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and disaster floods in the country, announced the RSR authorities through the embassy (with which he had a high correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he could not take the invitation to return to the country.
The next was predictable: it is again put to index, it is mounted in Israel "tolladot business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments d'une journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never to see their mother again.
Among friends in the country only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence, though surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of private people or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr was no longer allowed to write after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Eliade's second conviction operation (by official invitations, the steps of Noica, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed forever.
New coach, foreign player
Because of the shortage of indigenous volleyballists, Penicilina Iași tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
The departures take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year in Division A1 of female poultry, Penicilina Iași has kept his place in the first stage due to retreat and then to the disbanding of the Miroslava Science band, fresh promoted in the first sample following a barracking tournament contested even in the municipality of France.
The news took little to the unprepared leadership of the outing group, which woke up without the principal coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, reached second to the Bacău Science) and many missing players, some withdrawals such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studineanu, or left, like Ana-Maria Berdilă (the champion of Alba Blaj) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Of course, until the scheduled 10 October season began, there was also time for the batch to be completed.
First he was found a new coach in Dan Gavril's person, who came from the male team LPS Piatra Neamt and who worked a little in the last few years at Penicilina, it moisturizes to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile Left.
Then two players were brought from the Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconita, and some foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to the transfer being the famous player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Penicilinei group led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at Gura Humorului, after which he took part in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from 23-25 September, Penicilina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship we're trying to make a valuable team.
We have an experienced coach, but Romania's player fund is quite small and that's why we're going to call on foreign volleyballists, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competition year on 5-6 places, even if it would be very hard," said Vasile Left, President ACS Penicilina Iasi.
An exciting meeting.
Twins reunited after almost 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69, were born at the end of World War II, in Germany, after their mother of Polish origin had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too ill to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know one about the other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that demonstrated that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they did not find any trace that would lead him to Lucian.
Just in 2015, thanks to the program, Restoring Family Links of the Red Cross, the twins met, and the time was more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by the Japanese children at German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
Iasi participated in five pairs training at the Dance Energy Club and danced with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children from the country participated in five different categories (youth and amateurs, young people, youth 2, junior 2).
Those who returned home with the medals were paired: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ştefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other couples managed to occupy leading places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iosub Cujab and not the last pair Andrea Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionița.
As a coach I very much wanted to reaffirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reaffirmation is necessary both for us as teachers and for sportsmen in terms of their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to make Romania's anthem heard twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals, we enjoy enormous and give us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to a higher level.
"All these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," Andreea Ramona Manolache, coach of the kids at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania has been represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country on the 4th of the 20 participating countries.
Note that of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 methods to get rid of stress in one minute
Too few of us are allowed to run a weekend to the mountains to escape from stress.
Some keep our time, others - the finances, and others both obstacles.
There are solutions to anyone who wants to get rid of a little bit of stress.
These do not involve high costs and special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we face them and what attitude we're dealing with them.
Instead of maiming inside and feeling how an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep breath
Breathing exercises are not intended for the soles or yoga practitioners only.
They work for any man in part, and regulating breathing in a tense moment helps release endorphins in the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, Livestrong informs.
Be a child
We know we've passed the age of childhood and we don't allow ourselves to drift away when we're in a mood.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of office headquarters or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and don't know how much we're holding our banners.
You can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated over a day with a few shivers.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation is worthy of a replica of a psychotherapy session, but it's not for psychologists to use it often.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detachment of daily frenzy, can lead to lowering the nerve state.
It's really self-supply, a process that can even change lives, both good and bad.
Everything depends on what we're doing.
The best thing is to think about an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put the castles in your ears and listen to the music for relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might feel the weight of relaxing.
Listen even to the relaxation songs, which are line and do not contain lyrics, to regain balance when your fitil has been lit.
Decojiti o orange
Does the advice to peel an orange off the nerves sound strange?
Well, it's not!
Because it's not about fruit itself, because it doesn't contain miraculous substances or Xanax to completely disconnect us (occasionally, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell, during the peeling, stimulates its brain to produce endorphins, hormone of the good state.
Eat an animal
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's about the one at home, or about the one who went to work, take a few seconds to keep it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal handling may reduce blood pressure.
hour and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with some rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, and famous pieces of the Romanian folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is titled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found each other, and from that moment it made us very happy to sing together, with a virtually unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the moment a violin met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that we were hearing very well what we were singing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from the other's repertoire and, what's very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a collapse between classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And in the second line, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen to and rock, and those who listen only to rock to get to like and classical music.
And I had the surprise to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, we think great."
Iasi students were more trafficked than at school on the first day after their vacation.
Hundreds of exits were yesterday morning "captives" in hell traffic in several areas.
The city hall announced that today the Mangeron boulevard (splai Bahlui mal left) is closing between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The Head of the City Hall did not comply with its promises to carry out some work to fluidize traffic with the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances given to the municipality, at least twice in the last few weeks, found in the re-establishment of the tour of the International War zone.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be mounted, and the last term of work was the end of last week, the rotation was not made yesterday.
The nerves of the drivers were spread to the maximum by Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, considering that another promise of the City Hall was violated: the move of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "at the late end of August", in the context that this transfer is still discussed since 2012.
Currently, Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica says that the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The tour will be done at the right time, we have to take into account the traffic of the trams in the area, we need an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on the tour, but we'll sort it out somehow," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to it, would stop the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of the Red Bridge.
The line of cars on St. Lazar Street was extended to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited for good minutes to get out to the Red Bridge," said a quitter.
By the Red Bridge in September they were required to circulate a streetcar to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "South Functional Arterial Development and Rehabilitation" was completed in the original execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"We drew European funds for new works, for example, on the initial variant of the Nicolina passage was narrow," Chirica commented.
The latest deadline for the reintroduction of trams is October.
In the course of yesterday, the outsiders reported traffic problems particularly in areas such as Păcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Road) or the intersection of Base 3.
The Admistress may return as chief to the CJ.
In the days of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judicial Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iasi Court resolved yesterday a new term in the "Album", in which the accused is also the suspended President of the Iasi County Council.
At the end of the sitting of yesterday, the magistrates decided to give a ruling during the day tomorrow on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Crown.
The latter wishes to house or revoke this measure, which keeps it away from the head of the JC for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained also by the higher court, Cristian Admonite will be able to resume his role as president of the CJ.
The municipality was sued by the National Directorate of the Anticoruption (DNA), being accused of favoring the creator and false intellectuals after, I say pro-curoris, tried to mask an audit control following which a number of irregularities were discovered regarding the reception of a public contract signed between the JC and the company Laser Co.
The municipality would have tried to hide the fact that the institution it led would not have received more of the promotion materials of Iasi County, although they were scripted as received by the JC.
In addition, three CJ directors and the manager of Laser Co have also been deferred to the judiciary.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote by 25 September
The City Hall is prepared to distribute further questions, if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The students have only ten days left to express their opinion on the replantation of the teas on the pedestrian Ştefan the Great.
According to the municipal officials, up to now about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the district centres and three additional points in the city (the Copou Park, the Esplanada Alexandru the Good and the Town Hall).
A record number of departures appeared on Sunday in front of the City Hall.
According to representatives of the civic group "Iash loves teii", 530 students voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes in each minute.
Instead, over the course of the month, about 440 exits came to the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many outsiders claim to signal and the population laughs inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they made an appeal yesterday to Internet users to print an information poster made available by the group and to place it in the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park the last forms were supplemented by Sunday's exits.
We'll provide forms from the neighborhood centers, where they don't really complete.
"Eventary additions will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed," said the municipality spokesman Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scrut the null teas" will end on September 25th, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of the replanting of the trees then the City Hall will plant the silver tea in this fall.
The students can express their views at the district centres in Dacia, Beautiful, Tatarasi, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The Head of the City Hall decided to cut the roofs of Stephen the Great at the beginning of 2013, which attracted a fine of 60,000 lei of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iash loves tea", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replantation of teas was signed by more than 9,100 supporters until yesterday evening.
RECORD of students enrolled in USAMV Iasi!
I'm 920 in the year I
The university has 920 students this year in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" have specified that this year were the most candidates ever admitted, from the history of the higher education institution, since the establishment.
We're very grateful for the results of this year from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in the history of the university, nearly 920 students in the year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We also had higher average candidates, we occupied budget positions at the license and master," Prof. Ioan Teenu, prorector responsible for teaching activity, said.
He further noted that the university also registered a considerable number of tax students, employing 20% of those places, a figure significantly higher than in other years.
Although the results were also published at the Romanian-language study lines, admission is still continuing to the English-language study programme at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has brought to the competition 50 places, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and is now expected to be answered by the ministry regarding confirmation of the student files and necessary study visas.
At the fall session, 120 dossiers were submitted to the 14 budgeted places and 209 presented to the competition under the "tax" scheme in the license studies.
The most records were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, at Horticultura was 23, and at Zootehnie, 22.
At the master's meeting, 18 dossiers were filed, on the 150 places at tax proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticultura and six at Zootehnie.
Drivers are afraid to get in with the wheels of the cars in the cracks on Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over Bahlu on Tudor Vladimirescu boulevard was as swept as when "Iasian Day" wrote about the problems it presented, ten days ago.
The reporters of our daily routine then signaled that on the axis that delimits the two meanings of walking asphalt was left, defending deep groups, some even 20 centimeters, by which the concrete plates that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
Asphalt also began to crack on one side and the other of the axis, giving evidence that the depths will increase.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to starting a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram line worth 5 million euros.
The Mayor Chirica specifies that the area affected by fistures and groups will be signalled, and restoration of asphalt will be carried out quickly.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the setting up of poppies and a signage band, without even making a simple lead.
During this period, we focused more on opening the school and the necessary work for that purpose.
"There is a point-by-point expertise for the bridge that we expect in about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm enjoying or leaving out of melancholy; lean, passive, toward the second variant.
First, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took it for the first time, with emotions, to the garden.
Although the breath is relieved, no normal parent is happy to raise his children.
Second, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, the height, has not ended until today.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I chose to continue to frequent her, even as a teacher.
When I decided that this is what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't a simple job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like every one of us, I've given all kinds of teachers: better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or more imbecile right.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this grid.
I think they're toxic, because they damage enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give as much as I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exception teachers.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the right time.
Who believes that the role of the cathedral is the banal transmission of some information is painful.
This can be done by anyone; to be informed, the student can be very well informed by himself, that we are only living in the age of transparency.
A good teacher, however, is shaping the minds of students.
They form them, they pay for their thinking.
Staying in the cathedral is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturous, demanding, unforgivable and always willing to look for the hibels in front of them.
That's how they dictate age, temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought we knew everything, that we had certain unruly about anything.
When we grow up, we get to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get adolescent out of his self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, to get in the way of doubting, asking questions.
Let's discover on our own the answers, both them and the suppliers.
Get involved in everything he's doing.
To discreetly direct him to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the students think the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just waiting to catch the wrong leg to sanction it.
Or, that just corrects him, the pure, misunderstood, rebellious, due to living his age's calls, to look at the cathedral with suspicion.
That it just doesn't have the natural way to accept his attempt to order it.
Teenagers do not get up to date, do not agree to impose restrictions on them.
Or, if I feel like I'm doing it, they're getting revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when a rigid person is found at the cathedral, who imposes himself through harshness and does not communicate, students take revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data supply, that mathematics is all that can be more stressful for their uncoupled mind.
I always urge my students: if you give a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him take you away from the literature to which you should go.
How did it happen that I became the teacher myself?
I had a very good teacher in class VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puberty since then on his understanding.
I've met, in high school, a university professor who opened my door to his library.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with shelves covered with books.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming of having the same one.
Now I may have it, but if I hadn't taken my fate in the way, I might have decided to become a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who knows what else.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in chance.
It's essential to pass over the man to take your hand and patiently to your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me to talk only about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be taught.
There is no literature professor, as there is math teacher.
How to focus on ineffable concepts?
You can, at the most, approach him, without the claim that you transmit stony truths.
The cathedral can at most guide the reading, that's completely different.
But in particular, he can enjoy some miraculous encounters between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, which can raise someone, the eyelids.
Therefore, the literature teacher must first manage to make his students understand (to feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great seam, Al. Paleologu, says one thing only seemingly paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and was right.
That's why a good teacher prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, it repeats only from inertia a great truth: not only the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student a teacher.
That, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few find it, it's straight.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to support as many such separations.

If FIFA is fully investigated
Justice in the United States and Switzerland will serve new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new individuals and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
U.S. Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced on Monday at a press conference in Zurich that there were investigations into global football corruption.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage additional prosecutions for new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been exiled to the United States.
"We have hopes that other prosecutions will reach the US," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution had put a lot of goods, including houses and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first round," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
In the interest of investigators, a contract for the surrender of media rights was entered into at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a great scandal of corruption, after American justice has accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven officers of the forum.
Detained persons are researched for bribe-taking and receiving other benefits, from the early 1990s and so far, totaling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, in early July, that he is resigning from the office of FIFA president, after being real for the fifth time.
Beating as a movie at the theater
At the Supekombat gala in Milan, the exit of Catalin Moroshanu will fight the "bestia" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Catalin Moroșanu, will participate on October 2 at the Superkombat Gala at Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a press release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as promised, we'll be back in this fall with a new five-star gala.
If we still chose an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to beat it like in the movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters on the program.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters in the new generation, including the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full programme," Eduard Irimia said.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight in the Galley Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with American James Wilson, known after the last pyramid in 2012 in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous prizes from bodybuilding competitions.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I saw Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the final, so now I'm gonna get revenge on him.
"The beast turns him into a kitten," Moroshanu said.
Invincible in 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have in Italy the last clashes before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, they both set up in KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm happy to go back to Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans there and promise them a new unforgettable show," said World Champion Andrei Stoica.
In Milan he will fight Raul Catinaș with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she also argued in a letter
A little girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to participate in her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit her family.
The letter was not left without echo, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but she also apologized that she could not be present on 27 September, but even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Paunescu died.
Both writers died heartily.
Adrian Paunescu and Vadim Tudor's destiny are similar.
Both were writers and politicians and both died at the near ages, of heart.
Adrian Paunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Paunescu died, on a TV reality show.
Full of story, Vadim Tudor ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the minister of tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Paunescu with the smile on his jokes, "I'm jealous of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He smiled, and then he said, "It's not too laudable what you told me now."
Adrian Paunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two Unknown People after an ACCIDENT at Dumbrava
An accident took place on Monday evening around 19:00 in Dumbrava, Iasi County.
A biker was picked up by a Volkswagen autotourism.
The cyclist was not noticed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the windshield and the mirror of the cars were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of the transmission of this news.
A SMURD crew is on its way to give the victims medical assistance and transport them to the hospital.
Cops are on site.
Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into refugee
A Syrian artist created a version of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his countrymen on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Ciuperci, the modified video game is centered on "Mario Refugee".
The person is trying to pass human traffickers and border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he realized the video game with Mario refugee after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of the war.
At Craiova Detention Center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Prison Administration to try to attract attention, and in this way, to less well-known realities.
The youngest student, 15 years old, is enrolled in Class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned to debate at this time, all of us are pressed by our own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Center offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said on Monday at the opening of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, may lead to tragedies, stating that the young people in this center would have had another chance to live if they could have taken any child's natural school course, if they had had the opportunity not only to learn to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what law enforcement means and what consequences may have been their disrespect.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate people who have violated the law, to lock them behind high walls, but to try to re-edit them and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they will have more chances of reintegration," added Cazanciuc.
The Minister has indicated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education courses.
Obviously, we're not going to be able to change the night that didn't happen 25 years ago, but they're important steps we're making.
"In all these steps we need and support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that by your work these young people have a chance and it is not a danger to society," Cassanciuc said.
The Justice Minister resented the success of both the students and the educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of everyone.
"And because today is the Feast of the Worship of the Holy Cross, I would launch all the students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of the Sovie, Marăști and not only, to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be disbanded!
The petition of prestigious colleges in Iași and the country
More than 200 researchers, university settings, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society in which it calls for the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even terminate the doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic tax".
Among the signatories to the petition launched on 10 September are teaching frameworks and teachers from Iasi.
Among the signing university students of the request from the Scottish academic environment is, for example, Professor Liviu Antonisei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to cultural people who are also university educational frameworks, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been accomplished so far, thus determining the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools which blatantly violate the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance," the petition stated in the opening petition.
The petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarized schools have been found, until evaluation and remedying the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there are no minimum number of doctoral students provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility for Ideas grants.
Do you respect less a doctoral general, or a politician, or an intelligence officer in the Middle East?
"Why are there no other academics in Europe to give PhDs organized by secret services, and senior military who give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, the initiator of the petition, who also originated in Iasi.
This can be completed by all the applicants on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 people want to get involved.
The "For Iasi" party, founded by young political non-affiliated IT managers, was launched elsewhere in Copou Park.
The Chairman of the "For Iasi" Initiative Group granted an interview to the "Iasi Day"
The Yash will have a dedicated party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of entrepreneurs and non-affiliated political managers so far launched last week's Party for Iasi organization that will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
The party's core is currently made up of IT specialists, but the founders of the formation say that all people who want to become involved in the modernization of the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in the Copou Park, and in the event over 200 sympathizers participated, almost all being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Association Save Bucharest.
He was surprised by the 2012 local elections when, from the position of independent, he managed to raise 10% of the votes of the gladiators for the function of mayor of the capital.
"The people I've seen at "For Iasi" I think they're very good at accessing Iash's public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I believe it has chances, I think it may have more chances in a community less than in Bucharest.
"I'll always be with "For Iasi"," said Nicușor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company from abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I was gone on many short business trips, I lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt that this is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have started to know each other for a while.
We met in the professional context, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more timid, in smaller things, with projects to NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved natural and organic and now it happened to be the time when we reached the decision that we have to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of minimal information of the city's activities so that different departments, institutions and regions can work together as well.
But more importantly, you can publish transparent data on activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about informational organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, it is important to public consultation of the people affected.
If we're talking about efficiency, we don't have to forget the common transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
We need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city really matters.
How would you promote the lake?
Andrei Postolache: Get on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You need to want to do this and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What's the lake brand?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology, one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotics area, in the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iash already has a historic brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for lack of experience in public administration as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and running projects.
We have management experience.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought with the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there's plenty of people like that.
ZDI: Should the Mayor of Iaș be more concerned with promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or should there be a need for the area of concerns to be always of an electoral nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without one doesn't work.
First you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your town known, if you don't draw money into the city, at some point you're running out of money and you can't make, for example, streets.
We need both at the same time and we need people with skills next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor-patuk, who comes and knocks with his fist in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people in the IT area who can financially support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have a bad reputation, be clear integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000 people who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, he set up the Introspecials company after, for seven years, he was the director of the Endava international relationship (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Four more years (2003 - 2007) spent them at Synygy.
The company that set up with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla Tractor Program proved to be a failure
SC Director General IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor and agricultural machinery park, initiated in 2011, also known as Rabla for tractors, was a failure because of bureaucracy.
Related to the Rabla Programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program he managed to sell himself somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," said Mircea Oltean.
According to it, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very big competition with those who come out, all world producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things that I've told you, and they have special policies.
"At all fairs it's big agglomeration, all producers exhibit, come in all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
By the Rabla programme for tractors, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could deliver and receive instead a ticket of 17,000 lei.
The red flag has risen
The internal election of Labourers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his lead in future elections.
Raise, therefore, the red-lit flag/ Under his skirts we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn played yesterday in London's Sanctuary House.
He has witnessed many facts and oaths/ Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left anthem (Red Flag/ The Red Flag) can search it on the internet and would not have excluded it from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we collapse.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and of those that fluctuate them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left yesterday with that of tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party's base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think that's going to happen like this, but I think it's premature to talk about the sea and the inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of a leader chosen earlier.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed an impressive democratic exercise.
The British Labours did not invent the direct voting system for the party leader on the western left.
The French Socialists have been working for several years on a more complicated motion-based system that allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate in 2012.
However, the internal election of Labourers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new leader chooses automatically becomes his lead in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of the political system, the customization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the Channel of France.
In addition, the participation in the vote was large in all three "searches": members of their own members, members of the trade unions and other affiliated organisations of the party and finally the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to get even more involved, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There is, as far as I know, sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this laburist "external search", so careful speculation is allowed.
I believe that we meet enough attitudes similar to those of sympathizers Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will go through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify a "antisystem" vocation, it is first reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of the much-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go far enough to the left, that they were not firmly bound by the Tony Blair era.
The second landmark - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for Scotland's independence.
If we ignore the separatist message and focus strictly on the aspirations of other political issues, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments favorable to the social state and animated by the aspiration of equity, followers of disarmament and hostile military involvement over the siege, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
The Scottish Labourers thus lost an electorate to which they should have at least in principle had a privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
Like energy is everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrat" Labourist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I believe, than the one with the left antisystem of the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we'll learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps, as the leader of the opposition.
We'll see if the Red Flag will come together in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader has occupied his place, first of all the opposing banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily a unit - and in this regard he has even reason to be concerned.
Trap manipulation with or without good science
While I wrote the article, I went through my head to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the start circumspect).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel two photos - that with boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and that, in fact, the two showing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh I took it from the article "Syrian fighters come with the wave of refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among others, a sleeve pull from the friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, rather a precision. Laith al Saleh is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate the rudeness in the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt bad.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through my head to check the story of the former fighter and the "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the start circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
On the spot, I then had no other comment on the pull of the sleeve from Marius Cristian than this: "I have to if I (I have) trust in the Truth"
After that, obviously, I took cash on the story and I feel indebted to the readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found it in a material of the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - rebel leader looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man who was trying to make order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian captor Laith Al Saleh from Aleppo who "is used to be in command", since "he led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war".
We also find out that 30-year-old Al Saleh had "a home, a wife and a normal life before starting a fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put on the roads a third of the Syrian population".
In the interview given to correspondents at the Associated Press, Al Saleh tells us that "Everyone wants to leave Syria."
My town's the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
Beyond being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man who recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from the government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also find that Laith (who means lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and can then bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an age with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this has been achieved, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the struggle for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (Russian-backed), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
Madness - who wants freedom must fight not one enemy but three in Syria!
I've gone over a Serbian material since 22 August, of which I didn't understand much, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come with migrants: TERORISTS SE KRIJU ME..U MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which they are joined a picture with Al Saleh with beard holding a Syrian flag in hand and that of refugees wearing the T-shirt with "THANK YOU".
On September 7, then, on the BBC website itself, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation using photos with Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claim to show an IS fighter posing as a refuge - This viral picture claims wrong that it portrays a fighter of the Islamic state putting in refugee.
We find that the photo (in fact: pictures - Laith with beard and gun and THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have and apologized in the meantime.
Only before that, just from his wall, the image with the two pictures would have been shared over 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That talk, too late, the horse had gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu de la Hotnews took over the story with the handling of the BBC, however translating the wrong title: "A false photo of becoming the virus shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, photography is not fake, but interpretation was a fake, wrong, short: manipulative.
