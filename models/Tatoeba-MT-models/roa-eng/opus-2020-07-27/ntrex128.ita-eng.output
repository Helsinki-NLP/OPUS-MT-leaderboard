Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned to "make the figure of clowns"
It is noticed that some members of the Assembly are inconsistencies in the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Galles Parliament).
This proposal was drawn up as a result of the programmes amending the name of the assembly in the Galles Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "it can be left with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means Cretan and pwp means Cacca.
One member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Welsh Conservative party claimed to be "open" to the change of name, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently being drawn up for the introduction of the amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what members of the House will be called will of course be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which had extensive support for the possibility of calling the Galles Assembly.
As regards the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a shortcut for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on amendments within a few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AM and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on their name during the debate on the legislation.
The massacres go to the polls for the referendum on the amendment of the country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to put an end to an ongoing dispute with bordering Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its neighbour's name is a claim in its territories and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the modification of the name, said that he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shut up while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elderly I talked to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"Today there's neither of them."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominium filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining shrines of the district.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black district - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the head of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the retailers of the 125th street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed to a bigger carillon at the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What was staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay officials of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concerns that the diocese "seek to download costs" on the parish assembly, although the latter had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds a thirteen-year-old in lobster fishing in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was diving in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the season of lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing himself with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "she realized that the boy was crying 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!
His whole clavicle was lacerated," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized under critical conditions.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles reported during a communication to the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
The authorities have denied access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and safety purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's program a push for beauty products in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with racing dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important push towards the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in fashion and household items decrease, the largest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in more shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to television sets, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty items up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the dealer of perfumes The Fragrance Shop will experience authorisations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to persuade people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the point of sale will increasingly resemble large stores while the chain of supermarkets tries to resist discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced the Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted food sales and has made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to return enamel to its departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals has ended up in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sale in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of an extensive range of luxury leather products brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furioso" after Holly Willoughby came up with an arrangement of 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract with his trend brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his home brand and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The presenter of This Morning, 37 years old, resorted to Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left her star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after withdrawing from their profitable trendy business at the last minute to focus on her exceptional new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furioso" when the gold girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts - for a value of £1.5 million - did not leave them enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of homemaking and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it was calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It must have been his long-term future that he would have committed for the next 20 years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely without words.
No one could believe what was happening Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones had a share of 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as guest of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have considered "non-presidential" and so be positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice to the imitation of the "television conductor".
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he stressed, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to keep pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving excellent results," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 outsiders trying to enter this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, indicating the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravage an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a little complicated," said Subangu.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
After all, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although refuges have been built for tsunamis in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for tsunamis in Palu, although alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put at the centre of his electoral campaign the improvement of infrastructure in Indonesia and has poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko also has to face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been removed from their homes because of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool parigea against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at the 89th minute on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 meters from the Chelsea Gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt passed high over the door frame as it turned towards the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga by bagging in the network.
"It was enough to try to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I hit her and I didn't think too much and I pulled out."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the 25th minute goal marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
Blue’s centerman went by heels to Mateo Kovacic before kicking off near the middle of the field and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic took a quick step halfway.
So he ran a beautiful passage that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left-wing goal beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round-up of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, declared the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters on Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated high waves up to 6 metres, communicated the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been swept away by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police invited people who might have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only early, but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious and to invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular to the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on dashcam, so that they can contact us because they could have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of the rapture this morning.
The investigations are under way and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victims' family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.

The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the wave of "rewriting of history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follia" and an "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclasty during the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of the view of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents part of that fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer pig blows a Chinese farmer killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China based on news from local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a narrow artery, covered with blood near a pig in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
He reportedly traveled with the cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the swine with blood on the muzzle.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had broken the farmer, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and ground," said the cousin identified with the last name "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the farmer.
Although rare, cases of human attacks by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to get rid of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa's scissors will bring heavy heavy rains to the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength while moving on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on North Mexico and on the south-west coast of the USA in the coming days.
Rosa recorded up to 138 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north of Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north, in the south-west part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Therefore, tropical humidity in contact with the nearby packing will create heavy and vast precipitation in the south-west area in the coming days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause sudden flooding, debris flows and possible debris in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in the areas of South Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is planned in some areas of the south-west, particularly in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture in the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could make the canyons of rivers full and the temporals will bring wind to bursts and raise dust.
Sacking will cause heavy rainfall at local level on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery lanes.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the humid season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona towards the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become wider at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will descend on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations of temperatures on the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to important temperature variations over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in the Central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is planned a warm beginning of October for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate high temperatures above average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the successful deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with the broadcasters who interrupt regular programming for a last-minute performance on Friday: an agreement devised by the senator from Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation on charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is certain 100% of the fact that Kavanaugh slapped her in a state of darkness and tried to strip her during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, said it was 100% certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to count the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it is a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or for Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience throughout the day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was resumed by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take a lift to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stayed with his eyes for several minutes while being reproached and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee's hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the nomination of Kavanaugh to the whole Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the assurance that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by minority democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and with other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize his programmes of letting the European Union "political face" with the future of Britain and jeopardise the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal according to which Britain and the EU have to collect their duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrest the suspect of LSU Dyteon Simpson's player's death
The police arrested a gun-gun suspect from Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and put in jail on second-degree murder charges, declared Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and said they detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated with the CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney reported.
East Baton Rouge's legal doctor's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the police science lab, the Southern University Police and the local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of LSU thanked the local order forces for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where also the father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds at the match.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade coach said the team was "confused" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about at all times," Wade said.
Volcano ash cosparge Mexico City
The ashes that emerge from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Calamities warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours had been recorded.
The center was checking the different rumps and shocks.
Pictures on social media showed subtle layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity corresponding to the volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometres) south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit Mexico's central area in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protesters clashed with the police anti-summous teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the secession.
A group of masked separatists blocked by the anti-sommous police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
Further clashes occurred during the day with police officers who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted with the demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the events.
Tension remains high in the independentist region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the turnout had been low, and the Catalans against secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at headquarters throughout the region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had gathered on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said he had no hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy for the chance to vote, but now it's all blocked," he explained.
Despite having won a fundamental victory despite measuring the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties have made it difficult to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves voluntarily exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fuelled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the sprung of a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car hit a Londonderry house repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at a certain point.
The attack of Menga marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston marked the victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers astonished by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as director of the Iberian club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore left without an out-of-home victory in Premiership this season and will have to face the first Hearts class next Sunday, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile the Livingston continues his series of wins in the division remaining beaten for six matches, with the coach Holt who has yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against unincisive guests
Holt's team should have been in favor well before the goal, with their immediateity that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson collapsed but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he joined to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put visitors in trouble with socks placed.
And so it was that the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a punishment football and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to pass to Menga, which could mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated in possession of the ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the carrier Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped from the feet of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's doorman made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
Crossing happened in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigor, after the Halkett contrast with the Glenn Middleton replacement and one for hand failure, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this outstanding trajectory.
Their style of play and the collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he was able to sprain the team from his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett has been immense, led by a masterly organized defense, while Menga has put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have fallen well below those standards.
The last step - only once they were able to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are in the middle ranking.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at distancing relations between NATO allies.
There have been discussions on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed towards Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have motivated the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, including numerous Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road Incident in Deptford: Cycling driver dies in battle with a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficked road from Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at 10:15 BST about.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the Saturday accident occurred.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded guards during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the maximum security male prison, he informed the prison office.
The tumult broke out at Long Lartin's maximum-security male prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still in progress.
Specialized agents "Tornado" have been used to manage the tumult, involving eight prisoners and is confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on site for slight facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Personal prison specially formed has been deployed to contain an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Lartin prison houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-summous agents were called to intervene in the prison to heal a violent turmoil during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (of which the drought-affected areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, but it is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued sudden flooding alerts by Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head straight to Phoenix Tuesday, approaching on Monday in the evening with rain.
The national weather service of Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls will probably be positive because the South-West area is currently undergoing drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Centre, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
Initially the route of the hurricane Rosa will take to the mainland through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the force of hurricane on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles an hour.
The storm will emerge with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-west zone of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," notedweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and towards South Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that Rosa or her straddling may cause is intense rainfall in Baja California, in the north-west area of Sonora and in the South-Western desert area of the USA," the National Center for Hurricanes reported.
These rains are expected to generate sudden flooding potentially lethal and flows of debris in the deserts, as well as lands on the mountains.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in the Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who could have taken over what happened with the phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh filed before the Congress on Thursday, denying passionately and decided the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed the hearing defending himself from the prosecution.
The President declared on Saturday that "the American people could observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the minds of the most experienced law of our time, a jury with previously unattainable in the public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh by discussing the importance of republican influx to midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do have to do it," he said.
"For this lot hard for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first basic procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, as stated to the CNN by a senior assistant to the GOP management.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the victims' figures continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and were not run away immediately, thus turning into victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged with itself cars, logs, houses, hit anything on the mainland," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved to the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Agency for Disasters have shown numerous destroyed buildings and shops, round bridges and collapses and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shocks of harassment continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extense" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were scattered.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "have been completely paralyzed, with no information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on a top floor of a building shouting a nervous way to warn of the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, sweeping through buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending cargo aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced persons still need food and other necessities.
The airport of the city was reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami victims' balance in Indonesia rises to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff managed to reach the city of Palu safely and safely, where employees took refuge in shelters of waxed canvas in their office courtyard, they met devastating scenes during the journey, Doseba said.
"I've been told that I've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups began the difficult start-up of relief gears, there were some complaints that foreign relief operators with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations stipulate that funding, supplies and staff from abroad may begin to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared as a national disaster area.
And this has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family members of the disperse still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the preparer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the lost paragliding pilots.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, have stopped at a single sign of grey rather than two blue marks.
"I think it means that messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a refueling of ATM at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was resupplying an ATM at Newport on the Levee, on the occasion of a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "was caught behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, being in the press release, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about the identity of offenders is invited to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has long been nicknamed Ye and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place before he took part in the Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the program with the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our wickedness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
An ex-worker from West, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without indents and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were taking their feet throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by raising monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are driving young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funds in this field, asserts the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow the announcements of different groups of the US government about AI, although in the USA there is generally a lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be country No. 1 in innovation AI by 2030.
"Coulding the budget in search of the AI would be a good start considering that all the other countries are much behind US and we need a new revolution in the AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big success in the AI sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American player of Otello with the highest score and later was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it will be held next, to be able to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work hard to obtain funds from the government, Lee said.
"It is not China that is leading academically, it is multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts under AI.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute funds to researchers in the USA, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industrial partners and universities and the White House announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the US order to create a National Commission for Safety on Artificial Intelligence has not registered activities for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve the ten-year dispute with Greece which blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has placed the veto at the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments have reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts as to whether the influx would reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The request on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the agreement accepted with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is the price to be paid for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change of the name would require a two-thirds majority.
The State Elections Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO membership and to the European Union in Struma, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and settling the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in the head, not for the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO will bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the requested turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the influx must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the phil-Western government since it settled in May last year.
Guarda: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 game won by Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point marked at the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green meshes.
He humiliated one defender before overcoming several others to the limit of the Brighton area.
He then made a passage to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat the doorman of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a right shot on the net.
"Aguero is having trouble at his feet," said the city coach, Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about it playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he could score at the time."
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues into the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball over the net shortly before leaving the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one race with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play aimless, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the top of this year.
And why shouldn't I ever want to compete?"
Nationals still have to announce a first launcher on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, performed a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal Sunday of rest.
The Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while he spoke about the importance of the influx of Republicans in midterm elections.
"All we did was put at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving myself up for that, I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Let's see this awful group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see badness, meschinity.
They don't care who can hit, who needs to wander in order to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it has been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats " angry, mean, mean and lying."
He referred to the Justice Commission of the Senate with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering strong fisque strikes among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I expect one - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been informed not to be welcomed, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has been treated in a similar way because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
However, today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "most kind and courteous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
All this began shortly after Jeremy became head of party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought of sharing a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of trend on my part and that I would take positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - they follow insults on the social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my fellow Members, because the comments I speak for tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a stream of insults to sexist or racist background every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
Over the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower the head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything would "be fine".
But it is not to do this that I have entered into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago from school, caused by the darkness of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be left in any way be bewildered by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family nuclei, our companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those who I believe are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an Ayr struck the ranking
Two late attempts might somehow have weakened the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptional fun game of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the ranking, the only team that hit ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their daringness, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still hit, so I have to be happy," the coach said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "You must recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of the opportunities of us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow sign for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot seized an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, just in half time, to mark and therefore to convert a goal by itself to bring the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But the Melrose started well the second time and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted from Baggot, has reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was caused to slow down, and at the beginning, the Ayr was rocked again to the advantage thanks to a target of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The alternate captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow sign and Melrose made the man pay in addition with an unconverted target of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
But the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without a ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the compound in progress of the Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since restarting, after Rowe had collected football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to search for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, who writes and plays together with the long-standing partner Greg Hemphilll.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final show and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosper restaurant trade."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a break on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path towards the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered with sartiame in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without a break on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to rock once again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has a lot to do with Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would change little if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice judgment arrived just six months after the final cases indicated that the case was ‘not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years might have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has spoiled any good intention remaining from Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations to a certain extent, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as a result.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly timely.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "take advantage of extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with each other's advantage," she explained.
Calzadilla also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political squawking.
" Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong I said that his nation will never do nuclear weapons disarmament if he cannot trust Washington before.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to be faithful to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intending to restart diplomatic negotiations in a state of stagnation after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Re explains that it is a "illusion" that the continuation of sanctions and the US' opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington refuses to issue the statement without before Pyongyang performing important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is intended to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion shop near you
If you want to expand your collection of covers or completely block the rays of the sun, do not look further.
Valentino and Thom Browne stylists have revealed on the passes a series of crazy oversized covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the world of fashion at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have made Instagram angry this summer and these designers have sent their attractive creations on the walkway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than at high seams.
One creation looked like a complete for diving with masks and glasses, while another seemed like a frozen cone.
And if you carry on with the huge style statements, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that the huge beads could reach you in the high fashion streets.
The outsize hats arrive on the line of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide woof more than a meter that was seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat very little practical that invaded the social media sent another huge creation in the walkway: a beach bag in large straw almost as the model in costume that the door.
The handbag in burnt orange-coloured race, finished with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The designer of the celebrities Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags will arrive in the luxury shops next summer, because the designer has achieved such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results to the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As the education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and required subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust the English alone if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the graduates, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the maximum votes.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, have shown that 72% of the students obtained maximum votes in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained maximum votes.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
At present languages, as a choice of subject matter, are considered at the same level as STEM (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty of covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with life skills like this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a survey of YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a percentage to two digits, 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Chinese Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teaching staff specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages are still fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communicative competences."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entrance with Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the Sunday pre-champed opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it must still be established for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six-game Lakers' pre-champing program.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare me," he said.
The time of the gathering a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a rally break.
This is the first of the five rounds scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation pending for his choice to cover the vacant seat at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress at the November elections.
At what time will Trump's committee be and how can you follow him online?
Trump's committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow Trump's committee in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings of the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become the subject of charges of sexual violence with a vote of early confirmation of the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get some push.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings in the coming week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans seek to protect and expand the increases they hold in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies," based in Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for its programme that the president will travel in as many states as possible as we enter the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesperson for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for Wheeling's Wesbank Arena, tonight's committee could call back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media coverage of Pittsburgh," based on West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he had won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who's on the tail in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him into the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University politician, at Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team demonstrates the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until individuals on Sunday
After three unique sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the swinging pendulum is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had an advantage of six points and now there are four points, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike," Jordan Spieth said as he went away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four further points with another twelve at stake.
Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful, not the last form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each has three points on four.
Spieth was spyed by the tee to the green and he's giving the example.
The gutural shouts of celebration became stronger as the match continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the count four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who made them win the match at the 15 hole was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to get all worried about your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely couple of Europe is four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That path, and the way in which their energy seems to flow from and to the noisy crowd reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun goes down on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon reached Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes smothered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they couldn't even far get back.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and do not give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the USA team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage on the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing the fourball and foursome games on Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on an irregular American team in the morning forball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. have resisted more in the forsoms, winning two matches, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European leader to win four points of line while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the forballs, they worked superbly to beat down a Woods and the American co-ordinator Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional genius sprawls but lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourballs and in the foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's fourballs, has returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the expected results in a pleasant and ventilated day in south-west Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a bitter 2&1 victory on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the forsoms, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point drop by passing to the individual, though as the owner, Furyk's team only needs a tie to defend the trophy.
After having been the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday to the UN that the maintenance of sanctions was taking over the distrust of the country in the USA, that in these circumstances it would have been absolutely refused to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong I said at the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as the halt to nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any consistent response from the USA," he said.
"Without confidence in the USA there will be no security in our national security and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri has reused the regret notes concerning Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as has been done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end agreement to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed appeals to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The USA insists on the need to "have denuclearization first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose coercively and even oppose the "war-end declaration," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our trust."
Ri made no reference to programs of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced at the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister underlined the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to target the US territory with North Korea missiles after "the evil president" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage in undertaking the course of disarmament, but said that much has yet to be done and that sanctions will remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Thursday to the UN Security Council that "compliance with the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and verified denuclearization will be achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He was released by Pyongyang in July stating that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of having presented "request by gangsters."
North Korea had engaged in a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the USA had adopted "conformities measures."
He said that Kim had explained to him that the "conformity measures" he wanted were security assurances Trump had committed to Singapore and actions towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year pushed all its students to sleep more in the attempt to counter the growing virile culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
A university scholar noted that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this kind in the USA.
He had the idea to start the course after a conference that had given the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"In the end a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why is this only being told to me now, when I'm in the last year?'
He said that no one had ever told you anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dorm room, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gymnastics shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how lack of sleep over the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice of smoking cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being a constantly growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, hopelessness, anxiety, explained and should even serve to avoid fattening because the lack of sleep brings the brain inedia mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year during his first year in Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course addressed to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set up a wake for when they have to go to bed, as well as when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circadian rhythm into tilt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression out of the house with Dolly Menga's goal that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrax team was looking for the first out-of-home win from the February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games by leaving his team eight points away from the fleeing leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga has scored seven minutes before the interval and a formation of the short-inspired Rangers has never seemed able to look alike.
As the Ranger now descends to the sixth place, the Livingston rises to the third, and only behind the Hibernian by difference of goal.
And there could be further problems coming for Rangers after the Calum Spence watchman was treated for a head injury because of an object apparently launched from the outside.
Gerrard made eight shifts to the team, which quickly passed the Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that took a point at Hearts last week and would be satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated by ball possession but Livingston has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just two minutes later when Menga's filtering passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door, but the centrocampist wasted the opportunity.
A deep-punished football by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to pull on the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigour.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should see a rigor at the end of the fifteenth due to a clash with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the door in the first time but the former carrier of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about the head shot of Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute opening goal may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he earned it only for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed in Jacobs depth.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact because the wing pushed a ball to Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the doorline to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halfett collecting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers Glenn Middleton's replacement filed one last request for rigor after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanacco: the inventor of the counter Geiger
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and CONTEGGIUM continues... the day the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that has made the device known as Geiger counter.
A stop point of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," performed by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones you can really feel the effects of atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "For a while, it's really blowing right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of tumors and are then reinjected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, has seen her ovary cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute of the USA based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of tumor", including that in the breast, the ovaries, the lungs and the colon-direct, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect tumour cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

Kanye West was flogged in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after an inconclusive performance during which he praised the President of the USA Donald Trump and said he would apply in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA berth, he began to rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I speak white and say, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the show with a screenplay whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star played the story of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not transmitted, the recording of the West Flippic was uploaded on social media by the comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to go around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad time backstage because of his cover.
"I got bullied in the backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I'm an outcast," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the dark place?" and said, "I'd be wearing Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice by the public, and the members of the cast of the SNL appeared embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the newspaper: "In the studio, a deadly silence has fallen."
West had been invited as a replacement for the last minute of the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has bewildered many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised by Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: FREE TO HAVE TESSED TO THE MASS."
But the conductor of the Karen Hunter show tweeted that West was simply "what it is and that's just wonderful."
"But I have chosen to NOT reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embracing a vomiting ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the music legend disappeared Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for accommodation in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was housed in a restaurant in Belfast east Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhacklove, according to the police.
The accused must present himself at Belfast's preture on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
Sword Throne Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Sword Throne.
But 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such soils on screen often make boys believe they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview at The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and thought about how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Spade Throne, 31 years old, admitted to being very worried about this problem.
'I personally worry, very at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
Because of course something went wrong for young people.'
During the interview he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequel or sequel of Spade Throne once the series is finished next summer, stating that he has "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this way my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy winning series at Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, as stated by the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Due to the traditional values of the country, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are caused by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these reports.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has made the data of the GOP senators hijacked, and speaks of "dangerous magic" and "conspiracy theories".
The US MP reported on Saturday the charges against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three United States Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles said that the statements were encouraged by opinionists and websites of the "ultra-right wing".
"Bugies, lies and still horrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a committee of experts on charges of sexual violence against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and issued the information concerning a member of the Waters staff.
"This false accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these false and trendy accusations, was in no way responsible for the escape of such information.
This false accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' claim quickly generated online criticism from the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It must not be provocative.
You must not question the prosecutor's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of looking too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the race to destroy Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Employable if confirmed," tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office warned "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these trendy claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny's Review English still hits - the parody of the spy with a undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The rebirth.
Will the self-sustaining veil on how much crap we're doing be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits has obtained his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for countries of non-English cinema producers.
Obviously it's the silly secret agent who despite his strange glamour claims has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that guy who has contributed with a single note to Gloria's moments theme of the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
It is a character initially based on the mysterious international traveler and man who once Atkinson played in Barclaycard's now forgotten TV ads, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English that he approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers spattered briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that "seri" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comity as an ingredient.
Humour seems directed to children rather than to adults and to me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not so original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson silent movies when he plays Mr Bean.
The current premise now immutable is that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the debriefing of the officer in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that brings the vase to a presumptive and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a stroke of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this May-Teresa character but there is not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisors inform him that every single active spy has been compromised and that he will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the accursed Johnny English, who now works as a school manager at a chic establishment, but also imparts in-office lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a course of espionage like School of Rock.
English is reissued in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering Bough partner, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of falling into the charismatic billionaire network of technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire in a French restaurant; they set the hell underground by entering the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take dimidity with the house of Volta.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as cute and exuberant, there is a lot of children's TV throughout history.
Everything's pretty modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry could not assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be preparing a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to tilt the country to the benefit of workers.
The shift to a day of four days was endorsed by the union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a review of the policy line is expected."
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party stated: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently discussed."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to discuss his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power by "faceless directors" and "specialists" in public services companies.
The shadow chancer's plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement "deductions" on the basis of conduct considered unlawful.
It has also confirmed the plans to place employees on business boards and create funds with inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10% of the net worth of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up placing in annual dividend pocket up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and raised the question whether the findings of the government agency could affect any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will be on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible that the FBI will bring to light something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it when I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, which came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett energetically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you name couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I see nothing new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable star-carrellate and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Upon the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a awareness of the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now been for 12 years to achieve its intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktivism"- people who feel they really make a difference simply by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, used for a lot of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, intended to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In the early years of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which they have already been paid out or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that until now the protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to the maximum of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to appeal to the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favour of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on your own website, who asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous path - sometimes we will frame and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, "if necessary", use its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where he is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern fulcrum of Europe," he said.
And, according to the officials, there are ways and means to face you.
"The United States has the possibility, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the defendants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise money and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "little versatile," with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to enhance the export of its natural liquid gas to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of North Stream 2, an "inappropriate" pipeline project that, according to Trump, made Moscow's "prisonary" Berlin.
Moscow has shown several times that the North Stream 2, gasted by 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of merely economic nature.
The Cremlin objectes that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a September meeting in Moscow with Rick Perry, Secretary for Energy of the United States.
The United States' position triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organisation of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to remain outside the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of running for the Presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren on Saturday said she would take the "serious consideration" of candidate president following the mid-term elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could qualify.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our bad government in place, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, as The Hill reports.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my candidacy as President."
During the Warren city assembly he said his own on President Donald Trump, declaring he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by him appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that there's a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's electors do not believe that it should run in 2020.
58 percent "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
32 percent supported such an application.
The survey was a major support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with a 38% support for potential candidacy and a 48% opposite.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed on a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What's going on with my son, what's going on after his return, I can put him in touch with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers return to," he told the public at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they turn a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new United States policy that denies asylum to victims on the run from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the Columbia District Friday presented a friendly Curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the call Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent gang children" abused her, but United States officials rejected his asylum application on 20 July.
He's been arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new United States asylum policy reversed a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed to submit a asylum application to immigrants without documents fleeing from domestic violence.
Friday the Attorney General of Columbia District Karl Racine said the new policy "ignored decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular events and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says amicus curiae.
Within the memory, the prosecutors also objected to the fact that the policy banning the entry of immigrants damages the economy of the United States, asserting the clear likelihood that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to guarantee asylum to victims on the run from domestic abuse and gang violence.
" Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or by political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been thought out to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to face every day in the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the balance of the dead doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish little baby in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every moment there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, circling among their fragile personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, were full.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continued severe harassment shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the sensation given by the violent earthquake that shook the room that shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed among the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "making prepotences" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial on a US newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the 6 November US Congressional elections, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump's accusation, concerning Beijing's attempt to get involved in US elections, marked what U.S. officials reported to Reuters to be a new phase of an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While for foreign governments it is normal to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war that saw them adjust their duties to their imports.
China's retaliation duties at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to hit exporters in States such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, as the Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and previously governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those prepotences by publishing advertising advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceful, in the editorial on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the differing views that the Chinese population might have on the problematic economic trajectory of China, as the media are under the staunch of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most illustrious newspapers in China has failed to publish" his article, although he has not stated that it is the newspaper.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many leading republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and are on his side facing various accusations of sexual harassment, analysts have indicated that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The excitement in this regard has been extremely high, and many republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You cannot withdraw these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an FBI investigation will be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it neither tomorrow nor November," said Friday, according to Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with the Kavanaugh candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they were already high; that's true.
But they could be higher, especially between the undecided power plants of the suburbs and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite the president's lack of pleasure."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction might have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it became a confused set," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote for the committee, about the final one or whether Kavanaugh will be put in the bench, it's also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom they believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees had certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they had certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent claimed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations on the charges brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals during a party during the Yale studies in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes its origins from Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the fact that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely at the discretion of the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not say to "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely discarded from one day to another.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The Church of England alone to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in its birthplace after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and he never knew that he had obtained the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, in Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren opened a memorial slab.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years from the award-winning prowess of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantery" moved the line forward before running with a single-hand cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he was truly honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is shown by the support that will be given to him by a lot of people."
The fans of MMA stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 combats, including the six on the main card, and had to be broadcast in the United Kingdom at night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, viewers in the UK were stucco when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until early in the morning specifically for the fight.
On Twitter a fan described the move to the cartoon for children as "a sort of joke of bad taste".
"The government regulation provides that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move on to programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for transmission.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of the Bellator Company, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I believe that when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But that's at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came in and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he's grown feeling less than anyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24 year old said he didn't realize until he got to high school, that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking in the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that he had become a parent so that he would have less interest in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-time program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The bronze medal twice at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has used his face in this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three times world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When she spent so much of it in her young age" - she went to her first Olympics when she was 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in front of the line.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You won't be around here so you can be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding my hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-form Mickelson put in the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will mark a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an infertile stone billion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a 12th time as a record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between being a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, in the hope of correcting what torments him.
Since he has never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unknown route regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the journey itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, faces the keen champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novelino Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, with four points below the beginning of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put a arm around me, and said he'll be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect to play two games.
I thought more, but that's the way it went, and that's the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup which has never even far mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven pairs, even though Furyk has said that his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, aggressive, he likes to play people's games, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players have had fun stepping up against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did much more than play"
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable affair.
The Danish debuted at the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, captain of Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, arrived at the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep telling myself that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"So it will be the story to prove to me and to my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we have to do our best.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not finished until the points are marked in the washbasin.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy the way hers raced in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have gotten over it.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to get out the best of yourself.
Then, forget about your partner because he too has to go there and get out the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Counterpart Jim Furyk will look for the best individual than team performance in its players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself met both sides at those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to leave immediately with the right foot as we did at Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the midgames.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that it seems appropriate to us, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the counterfensive and facing Rory McIllroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last German military fleet was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the cold war times, but there will not be at least until next year due to defective systems and a burden of costs.
The commission of Rheinland-Pfalz, the admiral ship of the new mills of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the military navy in 2014, but worrying issues following delivery tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-aircraft missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new mills up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will already become obsolete when they come into service, notes the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 fregate made news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noted a number of crucial "defect software and hardware" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it has emerged that the ship weighs significantly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the military Navy's ability to add future updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached the 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involved in the new sinks become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "loads ships capable of being used".
The official said that the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the baden-Württemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate is aimed at revealing how bats use sight to get food.
It is hoped that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown earrings and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of callbacks of bats and the manner in which each species behaves.
They will then produce a map of habitat and a report to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for nature protection for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain the forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom declined significantly in the last century.
The bats are at risk because of the construction and development work that affects trespolies and damage habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as moschicide paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect insects and obstacles on their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect trespolies and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization has even established the first reserve of Scotland intended solely for bats in the estate of Three, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Three we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the ancient buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternal trespolus can kill up to 400 females and small, perhaps sweeping away a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their trenches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are passing through."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while legalists cause German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape charges against him as "false news", claiming that people "wanted to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who has published the accusations.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also reported on Friday the charge of the payment of $375,000 to keep the silence on the event.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five times Golden Ballone turned to the camera.
"They want to be advertised through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the smiling footballer.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the charges, called "an unacceptable report of suspicion on the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will claim compensation for "moral damages to the extent corresponding to the gravity of the breach of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of the personal rights of recent years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at Las Vegas Palms Casino Resort.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Majorga would be returned to the footballer's room, where he subjected him to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the District Court of the County of Clark in Nevada.
Majorga argues that Ronaldo would have been kneeling after the incident saying that he was for the "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by the "one percent".
It appears from the documents that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Majorga also states that he went to the police and hospital, where his injuries were photographed, but that he subsequently agreed to a conciliation agreement because he felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "coming publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the agreement, claiming that it is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom could "repair forever" the loss of its position as a world leader in the construction of cars following Brexit, said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He added that he was "concerned" for the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC on the possible exit from Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary blocking of production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese motorhome claims that delays at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, General Manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases the concern in other British car manufacturers for exit from the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, argues that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the risks in the supply chain found by manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European car suppliers on order.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement, there could be inconveniences at the borders that would cause delays and a lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, said the company, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "thought to avoid these inconveniences at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The test, not only by Toyota but also by other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, over the long term, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsovullaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union representatives of the plant, states that the workers are very concerned: "On the basis of my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated".
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the vice minister of justice Rod Rosenstein could be "recommended for a week," while the dispute on Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference with the elections, the ties between Trump's councillors and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, fuelled Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a top to record talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and spoke of himself to resign.
Instead, it was announced by Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of training of the FBI's questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be a week later considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might dispute this statement: Sanders does not hold a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings is not due to an aversion for television journalists "that show up," although he said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they show themselves."
He therefore suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The President holds more Questions and answers than any President before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president may have proved the reason, making a free-wheeled speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance from the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to meet the costs of requests for settled status (stablely resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "We have continued negotiations throughout the summer between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated emergency following a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in the Saturday game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31-27, as Mike Organ of the newspaper The Tennessee reported.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the accident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached on board the camp and fainted," Reed said.
The first aid workers and medical staff administered oxygen on board before placing it in the deck and taking it away for further verification.
A manager of the Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "we still haven't heard about the type and extent of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is at its first season with the Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five plates before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the workers
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, it will announce today Theresa May.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing accommodation at a more affordable price and higher income.
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the homeless.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the buildings buy to lets (sold for rent), could be more than 3%.
The Treasury Ministry expects the maneuver to collect up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of the new constructions in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers of a first home to enter the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had requested a cut on the stamp tax to help the younger ones with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the real estate up by gaining land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to renounce the affordable housing allowances to fix the British "real estate disgrace".
Mr Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including controls on rents and the elimination of unpunished expenses.
He also wants to give the board more powers over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, that is, life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for resident British workers.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate aspiration is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland's technical director, Jack Ross, says that his "highest aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted to the challenge of raising the North-East team that is currently in third place in the League One, three points from the top.
It landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after being led by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I've been in series B and that's all," Ross said to the Scottish BBC program Sportsound.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as team manager."
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic's former engineer claims not to be anxious about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me at this time is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the club's structure and facilities, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only be able to get the team back."
The start of Ross's manager career dates back to three years ago, after a period as coach assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement heart coach.
Then he helped the Alloa to save herself from the fallback to the third level and brought the St. Mirren from the edge of the retreat to the title of champions of the Championship, the next season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his career as a football player in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
"I really believed that the role of manager would be done for me, more than that of a player.
It sounds strange because I've worked well, I've earned my living and I've had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you have to deal with every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

According to one study, the right time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer hot wave has led to more incises to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern for catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales from 2.7 percent in July, while the incs of restaurants have dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England in the World Cup led to a month of July following a path similar to that of the month of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The 1.8% collapse in catering in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink most have proved to be the strongest, with a homogeneous increase higher than the fall of restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not in an excessive way as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks are up of 6.6 percent in the month, while the consumption of food has dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly severe in addition to constant pressure on costs.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, of which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
The overall increase in sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in roll-outs of brands.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for Pubs, bars and British restaurants combines and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the industry's reference company.
One in five child has secret social network accounts that hides parents
A survey reveals that one child out of five, some only 11 years old, has secret social network accounts that hides parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages
News has strengthened fear of sexual content
20% of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five, some only 11 years old, creates accounts of social networks that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a "principal" account cleaned up to show their parents, while maintaining a private one.
A mother who discovered by chance the secret site of her 13 year old daughter, found a teenager urging others to "suck me."
The research, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40% of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted by creating online spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voices for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in light athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sports to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a profound respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could bring a huge advantage by bringing it within the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the athletes' voice and I hope to be able to contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The U.S. winner of 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently an opinionist of the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would have been able to tell if I would have recovered and to what extent.
It was an expansive job but I recovered completely, learned again to walk and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!".
The advertising of a tyranny compares mothers and cows and divides online opinion
A company that produces a tyranny has divided its opinion into a network with an advertising that compares the nursing mothers and the cows that are coming up.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and wearable pullover of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new pulley.
Four real mothers dance in a flock of cows on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm milking but I don't have one thing" and, "If I hadn't noticed, these are not breasts but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Put it out, throw it out, feed the children, throw it out, throw it out, throw the milk to my lords."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy over the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video evoked different reactions among the viewers, many of which claimed that it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for the fact that their little ones are stolen from them a few days from birth," wrote someone.
The Elvie trench is worn discreetly under a mother's strap
Someone else commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for both mother and small.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a t-shirt for mothers who will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really a meaningless advertisement."
Others defended her and a woman even admitted to finding the "funny" song.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used the t-shirt, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irrelevant, but it is not far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use t-shirts (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "cups."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet t-shirt stuck in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the tyranny feel like cows.
Elvie trench, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be stuck in a breast-feeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children and even get out while milking.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "The Elvie tyranny is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use t-shirts to cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new t-shirt is able to ensure."
This is not the first time that the Elvie stripper has made news.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the bridge of the designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tendon at the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and political line of the Trump administration made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them into custody were generally illegal immigrants who are now afraid to jeopardise the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would have been fingerprinted and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who offered to take up custody of children alone.
Later the agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80% of people who offer to take up children or belong to the families of these people are illegally in the country and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules so that some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, as stated by those working at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferences rather than in person, in order to sue for their legal status at a court for immigration.
Those who will be considered unfit for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in confidence, the more they risk suffering from anxiety and depression that cause violent fits of anger or attempts to flee, as they say those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure like that of Tornillo where, due to its size, it is easier for the signs of distress of children to be ignored.
They add that the movement of children in the tendons without giving them the time to prepare themselves emotionally or to greet friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria is an enemy to the U.S., French and Turkish employment forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has now reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally with the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any condition," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has released all Syrian territories" from the terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable to their return and has accused "some Western countries" of "inquiries of infatuated fears" that drive the refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted in Syria until a political agreement will be reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the establishment of a bearing zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front connected with Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to be able to convene a new committee of members of the government and the opposition soon to lay down a draft constitution for the post-war Syria and to prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee by stating that the work of the group should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
'Cause Trump's gonna be fine with the second term.
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, his presidency should not end prematurely because of impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of bending of the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening have more than doubled to 1.05 million on the NNC and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has on average 2.4 million viewers in the first evening, significantly increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program exceeded the network's percentages by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire people are attracted to because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, TV showrunner of the ABC "Designed Survivor" series that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
The chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the story plot of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, if immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
However, to stop following the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Paura", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a full of trachotaneous clothing" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Storm Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
For example, I won't be able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what it does seems like a reality show is that every night there is news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the sale of actors and the daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. that praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to look at MSNBC and while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was dealing with the Senate's judicial committee and facing the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Inflow of external money in the mid-term narrower elections race
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is a flow of money, thanks to the re-alignment of a Congressional district which has made two members in office now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg brings in the scene the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election that took place last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been manipulated inconstitutionally in favour of republicans.
The 17th district race triggered a campaign characterized by a fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a measurement victory in the special elections in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then they changed their mind
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather friendly meeting took place between Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced Trump Organization's leading group to leave.
The officials of the State Department have decided to bring the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama into line with the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan," said the spokesperson for the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million in aid for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support from the Americans.
The sanctions proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and homicides.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from taking their leadership in the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thereby definitely renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesperson for the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously of internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an outside analyst near the administration who still wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report that will be published, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now appears to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If the Congress were to turn to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his own as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as it is not the fall of its counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed by allowing us to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points in which the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans at the moment have to deal with it differently.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year it has secretly suggested that Trump be subjected to interceptions by questioning his ability to fill the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news on The Times isn't true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress to ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to turn on the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans dei Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over Austrians, after the convincing match obtained against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them great opportunities to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident on the knee, midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first match of the season on the occasion of the 2nd match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can enable Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villarreal is a good team," said the player 30th year.
"We faced the game convinced of doing well and we brought home a point.
Perhaps we could have won in extremis, but all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
On Thursday it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will succeed in not disappointing.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself, but now the sensations are positive.
The team is fit, the boys have fun and the preparation goes well.
We can then forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the subject in the family.
About half of the interviewees from Nationwide said they had talked with their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% says they've talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk with your spouse and with your children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for the costs.
Involve a financial advisor: you can recommend how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
The choice of funding for long-term assistance may include a traditional insurance policy or hybrid life policy with ransom value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you have not been able to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of an attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you have not been able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent is brought urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finances, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the meds?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."

Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as " chance action".
The victim didn't see his aggressor.
He's not in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
The communications were interrupted and the rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala residence, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a Regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the Pacific fire belt and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a very strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226,000 people, of which more than half of Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern area of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke out against the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: a strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of which in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on the charge of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29-year-old Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and for resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her off her hand phone.
Palin was transferred to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility centre and his security was set at $500, according to the KTU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent."
Palin risks being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also committed a second-degree offence punishable by a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin is being charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Alaskan's Court of Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the denunciation of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the accident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a punch in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for connecting the violent behavior of the child to post-traumatic stress syndrome resulting from the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks do not work and the budget of the victims is intended to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, located to the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media shows videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks at NYC
New York federal prosecutors demand capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to land on a cycling track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and also "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued charges to Saipov 22 heads of amputation that included eight charges of murder with association to criminalize, generally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors describing the way Saipov completed it as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
Ten years have passed since New York's southern district pursued the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in court, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminating for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's spouses both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, native to Uzbekistan, has shown no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that he was proud of what he did in front of the investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As regards the 22 heads of imputation, it was found not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was called "suddenly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a recognition of guilt and condemnation to the ergastol without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously begged the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage has sworn to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of Theresa May suggested that he should deal with the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must " feel pressure" on Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be already out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May has to face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been emphasized by Tory in favour of permanence in Europe that have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, of those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the committee of the organization Leave Mean Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We would be out of Europe by now," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion would be changed from the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in Europe is completely false".
Parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, supporter of Brexit, also took part in the trial and told journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who turn on the streets hunting votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a strong message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
In the committee, Farage said that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they intend to betray the decision made with the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour commission in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit's flags after the band was formed this weekend.
The worker derided the Conservatives for the security issues they had with an app from the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for the non-attractive borders and for borderless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about running for the presidency.
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he will seriously think about running for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the democratic senator of the Massachusetts Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that could challenge Trump in 2020 was already in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town assembly since Trump settled.
One participant asked if he was going to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to fix the government and that means that a woman takes over the highest position."
Arrest for the murder of the player of LSU Sims
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reportedly arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday he broadcasted a video of the murder asking for help for the identification of a visible man in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was hit and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of comrade Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well by leaving Hamilton to defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, move that might be decisive.
Mercedes makes the next round by going back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, surpasses it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which Ferrari's driver tries to prevent the passage inside by risking ending out after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then guide the race for much of the race without stopping at the box for the change of tires and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
In the end, however, the pit stop must be at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps it is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to get me through.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first and second position," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump took over Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistence to support not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter who attempted to rape the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "wicks, bad and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being disclosed and those responsible say, "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the content of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," she added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is trampled by her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the confidential information, and I did."
But his lie is not credible for the president, who during the Saturday evening committee commented: "I say, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language he's ever seen."
In continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the messinity, the evil. They don't care who's hurt, who's going to have to go over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately went to the advantage of two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier shots.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the line.
Francois Bouchard marked the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who on Friday evening in Belfast had remounted and won the match with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal at 3:35 a.m. on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a rather animated first time, Sullivan brought the home team back in game at the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the match assistant to Cownie at the minute 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard regained the tie after a strategic maneuver at the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led the Dundee for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by marking the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who at this point have lost four of the last five meetings, will play the next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after dying to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take them off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were scattered because of a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong harassment shocks continue to interest the area and many are trapped among the rubbles in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the twenty-year-old Anthonius Gunanang Grand remained in his place in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was horrifyingly oscillating.
He wanted to make sure that the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirit, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"For us it's a very sad news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency will know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The compound of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," says the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and livelihoods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance transports bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there is a scatter after the lagoon crash
The airline of the flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now he claims there is a scatter.
According to Air Niugini's news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, for example age or nationality.
Local boats have allowed the other passengers and crew to take safety from the accident while the plane was trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline claims that six passengers were accommodated at the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy claim that the plane has crashed into the lagoon because it has not reached the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low altitude.
"And it was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the aircraft emergency exits.
He added that flight attendants panicked and shouted and he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a bridge provided help using a tire to transport people on the shore before the plane collapsed in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people died in aircraft accidents of the aircraft lines registered with PNG but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of the evidence of the charge in the new trial against a man accused of having burned alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell data to reconstruct the movements of the twenty-ninth accused Quinton Tellis and the victim nineteen-nine Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger's report, Rowlett claimed that he recovered the location data from several cell phones that demonstrate that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford showed up in court on Saturday and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that night he was in the Sanford truck, he confirmed that he was "lie why my truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile data indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of Chambers, Tellis eliminated from his phone the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge provides that the judgement will be passed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the aware hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by entering its positive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
They want to go back to their origins and make again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK with characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York nanny quotes a couple in court for having fired her with a "racist" text
In New York, a nanny mentioned a couple in court for having given her a discriminatory dismissal after she had received a text in which the mother complained about the fact that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist comparing the request to a true "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER NERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "pregnantly" fired Miss Maurice saying she was not satisfied with their previous nanny, an African American, and expected a Filipino.
She paid Miss Maurice for her work day and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice mentioned the couple in court and, in order to be dismissed, asks for compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, even if without a contract.
"I want you to understand that they can't behave like that," he said on Friday at the Post adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that the dismissal of Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to a person you were rude to, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "extortion", Plasco said that the wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get along with a person like that.
It's not a very kind behaviour," the financial advisor added.
While the legal case is still in progress, the public court has repeatedly denounced the spouses on social media by harshly criticizing them for their behaviour and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter as follows: "It's not easy to get in the clothes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the great success of Paddington."
I state that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that his father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like he had a son who reaches a goal: you are proud of it even if it's not your credit.
I think he would interpret Paddington's success this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter's phone that she was dying.
At the landing the daughter was transported urgently to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then she called me to tell me she'd be dead in a few minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fending.
She died a little while before and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, came aboard the plane with other passengers who were unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he said.
"All the time I've done nothing but crying low-headedly.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide are committed to preventing others from making the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales with tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and was killed at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said he lit up every room he came into."
But before he died he left the job because the depression had brought him "into a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost his 15-year-old companion Mark not long after the death of his mother.
"You never said he was feeling down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas Day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, it avoided looking into their eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He licked the family.
He cut us to pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has begun investigations
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," said Flake on Saturday adding that he feared that the committee was "losing calm" because of the block of root supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left for mid-term elections on 6 November. If republicans as expected will get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators pressing to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and thanks to him he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, which is currently constituted of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the indignities and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the data of the Ministry of South Korean unification, says that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates asked by those who illegally let these people out.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of refugees in North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations that are in a state of destachment.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security and in these circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossi calls Brett Kavanaugh "steric" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court as "steric" and says that he is not characteristically suitable to fulfill this task.
The Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called it hysterical," said Pelosi about the statement made by Kavanaugh on Thursday in front of the Senate's judicial committee.
visibly excited Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so much so that he could almost scream and with his throat narrowed from the crying as he spoke of his family and of years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats who defined the accusations against him as a "absured and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
The Pelosi believes that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has been warned against the Democrats.
"I think he has been excluded from his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then objected when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in the indictment in case it was confirmed and whether the Democrats should reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that now presides," said the Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for its confirmation, Kavanaugh dismissed his questions about his intention to overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that "You cannot send a hysterical person and party to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive manner".
And women must use it.
It's a fair diarrhea, months and years of anger attacks that you can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere. She told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she was angry and she started crying she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought her idea was brilliant."
Tears are tolerated as a source of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the most sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying for an angry access. A woman older than me, a glacier manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified took me to the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy because they're in your fists."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when on a boat named Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extra-conjugular relationship that had to give up the race, the very disappointed Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she should not have tried to run for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a well-weighted decision," she said, laughing at us 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and certainly did not need another.
Someone called them "Biancaneve and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and swore that she would not run if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost cause on the way out.
She found out that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he gave the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for people who had supported him, disappointment towards the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination of which he was a victim), which he was moved.
"I seemed to be in the grip of a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder, thinking of the press reaction.
"Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
Maybe "Think a lot."
How the USA-China Trade War Could Promote Beijing
The opening-up of the trade war between the USA and China has been fragile and, while the battle is nothing but concluded, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the new duties on articles for over 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros) of value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing reacted with similar measures each time applying recent duties from five to ten percent of US$60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US strike and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon move back.
For Washington to resign, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but publicly bending to the USA would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the USA can positively affect China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is indeed far more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security Research Centre.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister supports
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is looking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In the face of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimate, over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem has said that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid conditional on conditions or on those countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The USA has so lost six consecutive times on European soil and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points that were used to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole in par 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his tournaments becoming one of the four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in Thorbjorn Olesen ranking of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, donated for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the tournament history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team win and I'm glad I made my contribution," said a thrilled Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his fellow John Ram who beat the legend of the U.S. Tiger Woods golf with the score of 2&1 in Sunday singulars.
"If I think I grew up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said the twenty-first Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the composure of his meetings in the Ryder Cup amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been looking all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf all over the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the team Europe.
We threw out this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players behaved very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA and with the Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all in.
But they played better than we did."
