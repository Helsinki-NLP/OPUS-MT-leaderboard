28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in Shopping Mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he knows no one who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, "His affairs have finally gone well."
The body, found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was defined as a homicide and that an investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a liner chef in Boston, had found his dream job as liner chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “horrified and shocked” by his death.
“We have a small team that acts like a close family and we will miss him very much,” he said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed at the hostel, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well."
"He found an apartment and was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was good-natured and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected to the family was to make us food, to make us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was a brother who drifted along with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a rough diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is advised to call the San Francisco Police Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Practitioners on strike: demands for new labour measures
Medical trainee representatives have asked their trade unions to approve new industrial measures in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the whole Council to support new industrial measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
Physicians and students voted in July to reject the agreement with the BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members on Thursday evening via Twitter, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “perseveringly silent” about the issues that led to her rejection of the deal.
He said, “In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new deal and to demand a formal renegotiation of all your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorise a progressive and expanding labour program starting early in September.
The controversy has resulted in six medical interns taking part in this year’s strike, including the first complete stoppage of work in the history of the NHS health system.
BMA's doctor Johann Malawana resigned after a vote to reject the terms of the agreement negotiated and recommended by the BMA.
He had told members of the BMA at meetings prior to the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was a good one and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be prescribed to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions to be over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that this reconciliation was wanted more in Ankara.
Yes, they held hands at the event.
But Putin’s smile looked forceful, and he didn’t exude much warmth, not even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost it.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had profited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by ISIS.
He has strongly denied this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of an armistice are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown in the failed coup last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush into the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are once again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the newspaper Vedemosti put it.
But the visit also had a political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West about what is seen as a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding the long-running resentment over the snail-progressed EU membership negotiations, Putin comes forward, eager to take advantage of the coolness and to break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the glamorous seaside booth enabled Russia and Turkey to present a “foreign alliance,” as an analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are major differences between the two.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be telling that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even addressed the issue.
The Turkish president consciously avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are even talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international goals.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these objectives.
The bank’s strategists have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent on international sports sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange listings, will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that are gaining more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff tour in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland, “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees because we will now become much more of a brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“Now is the time for us to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we’ve asked) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on our customers' needs, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins Newmarket with Prediclection and reaches 3,000 wins
Dettori Sprays Champagne After a Double Win With a Total of 3,000 Wins
Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone in his second victory at home, racing with John Gosden's coach Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Prediclection out after a victory.
Two racing riders have reached this milestone in obstacle racing – champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-times champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racing riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
She is elegant and strong, but her tactical intelligence distinguishes her from the others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he weren’t just a weekend and big game jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s a lively person who’s a good thing for the British race, but he’s also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a branded drone descent from the saddle.
From drone endings to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He won a bunch of big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but also survived an airplane crash and suffered a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after six months of suspension, but he showed remarkable strength of character when he challenged the skeptics and came back in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said Putin had “ordered Ivanov to resign from the post of head of the Russian presidential administration,” but no reason was given.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that the Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had withdrawn at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just the aftermath of a power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy has been received with great scepticism.
In comments quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complex, if I may say laborious, task for four years.
“I’ve been a chief of staff for four years and eight months now.”
Ivanov accepted the mandate in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
This task, however, went to another of Putin’s close allies, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years after his return to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at a set in Los Angeles.
The series' producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised Thursday before his dismissal.
There were creative differences and disputes.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details about how Gibson’s character will be removed from the series about a team of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series and have given it all I have for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans that a series can have.
The twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish end up in a garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be the windfish left behind by a waterstorm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published footage of the apparition in Periscope, hoping someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing Crossing: The Bridge Now Extends to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossing and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four enclosures between the "deck leafs" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ram ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the countryside to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing point.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this bridge section alone.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where the extreme precision dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge cover is now in place and the concrete cover of the last part of the cover is cast today at Rosyth, which means that the entire cover is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this shutter represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
When the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the expanding northern pillar, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, that is, from the inland side.
This was done by pulling a land bridge 700 millimeters south of the northern passageway.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Enormous, because it is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
It was demanding because the permissible deviations by which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are “lucky to be alive”
The three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alert at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helmsman of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third, a 60-year-old man, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to the rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, “These three men who were immersed in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the boat had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow loosened from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness.
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go gets people to get up from the couch and take part in an activity.
The display time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now more recently smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I’m referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they became a cartoon series, game cards and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was delayed, because the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and can be “photographed” (with a screenshot of the phone) or “catched” after being found.
The generation that played the game when younger has joined the craze and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the "average person's" daily steps.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
The calls from many public health campaigns to "find 30", "get up from the couch" and "be active every day" have not yielded any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving spoilers look for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what's the deal?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previous Fitbit-like apps that could track activity, they didn’t give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The charm of novelty disappears and the use fades in time.
However, with the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better shape, and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity bullshit.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth boom.
Unbelievable on the floor.
Wonderful everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
His overall score, 62,198, was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States at the Women's Rack Gymnastics Multiplayer Final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
She became the fourth American woman to consecutively win the multiplayer championship and, overall, the fifth American champion, while consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so astonishing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The final test was in Brazil, a competition that wasn’t so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of over-expectations.
Returning to the family home in Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman are hugging after winning the gold and silver medal (in that order) in the Women's Rack Gymnastics Multiplayer Individuals Final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the culmination of the departure party of retired national team coordinator Martha Karoly.
While Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future as he traveled his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program, which includes his trademark volts, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a toddler by her grandparents and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powerhouse.
He hasn’t lost in a multiplayer game since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will probably continue as long as Biles wants.
While Mustafina was in the small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the platform, where Biles is the ruling world champion, were waiting.
He reached the top with 15,433 boom points and exceeded them with 15,933 perm.
Raisman hugged her benevolently as they waited for the endings - a mere formality - and tears rose to the glitter-red, white, and blue bounded eyes of Biles when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a kind of revenge from four years ago, when he was in the shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the rematch.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in the lead.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanent performance, in an emotional rush of returning, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police say three victims of serial killing were shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The shooter, who was standing on the passenger’s side of the car, fired a handgun up to eight times and then escaped with another vehicle.
Police said the triple killing did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 from another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to examine whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks over a four-month period in two predominantly Hispanic districts.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of your home," Howard told KPHO, a CBS subsidiary, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Maleah, Ellis' daughter, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also published a police statement on the shooting, which occurred only half an hour before the triple killing, targeting an empty van, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet shells, bullet seats, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'The situation is getting easier'
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't agree to this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My initial reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking stand.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund's inventions signify "sing for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is not an ordinary sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What is going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect caused by Zika.
It'll get easier.
You can believe it'll make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Severe rains and floods triggered rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread floods in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and caused widespread flooding due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state’s authorities were in constant contact with local authorities and that help was already coming to the counties in need.
The Governor’s Security and Emergency Response Office spokesman, Mike Steele, said they were receiving requests for tidal vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The floodguard will remain in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five centimeters of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood guard was in force on Friday when rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were projected to set a flood record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said there was a danger of flooding Ascension County, downstream, as flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest level on Friday morning at 9:00 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters in Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
She says that her other step-son, who lives nearby, warned her.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had never seen the water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members were all injured and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said the rescuers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rainfall continues, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said the country was completely saturated by the heavy rain that had continued since Wednesday.
Severe rainfall and flooding of streets led to the rescue of Tangipahoa county residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, authorities said.
A CBS subsidiary, WWL, reported that a city council member in Tangipahoa said 200 homes had been flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
County president Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets that had been left surrounded by tides.
The towns of Amiten and Hammond have been opened up to shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They will return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, some twenty streets were closed because of the tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," city administrator Lacy Landrum said.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said the steady rain continued along the Gulf coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported to have flooded on Thursday, but so far no floods have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old was shot in the city this week.
Her grandparents told CBS Philadelphia her name was Mahaj Brown.
His grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several shooters.
Assault-type shells, derived from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems to me that this was definitely a constant struggle.
There were shells on both sides of the pavement.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat," Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are investigating surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old girl was shot in the arm on Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
Thus, I invite this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is amazing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible accomplishments of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win single gold in a women's multiplayer game.
And teammate Aly Raisman got a silver medal.
We see the peak of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because in the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts usually practice in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as for families) and the list continues.
A large proportion of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the species.
With these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez’s coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring cheaper and more accessible gymnastics training to the communities where Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspire many young girls.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latino) and coached national and international champions.
In September, we expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and work performance.
This team’s inspiration will get thousands of young girls into gymnastics, and that’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating serious “girl power” by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to embark on the path to healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctors on strike after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 trainees who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying the NHS was on “unknown ground,” and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which will include changes to night and weekend work patterns to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Medical Practitioner Committee, said in a statement last night: “Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will accelerate the existing labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.”
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced government reluctance to participate and at times deep silence.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the sanctions, and take into account the concerns of doctors in training.
If he does not do so, doctors-interns will be ready to continue their work-related activities.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a delay in nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 doctor trainees under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to doctors in training not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety, and disruption to patients, carers, and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of surveillance and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - would be a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Taking <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce your risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a drug that costs <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of these suffer a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the wall of the artery, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis breaks, it can cause a blood clot to block the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If a clot releases, it can travel with the blood and cut the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The NICE Draft Guidelines published today recommends that people receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When recommending ticagrelor for the first time, we are pleased to increase the available treatment options for the many thousands of people who may benefit from it.
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, for periods of more than 3 years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, reveals a shocking government report today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles reproaches the police, election guards and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
A former community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to place watch chains outside polling stations to protect feared voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity document when they vote to prove who they are.
Nowadays, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
We need better protection for whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for broader access to the press to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against election fraud, but it would also protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud," he said.
The report was commissioned by the government following the Tower Hamlets polling scandal in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court said Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting to appear as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the election fraud in the post-voting process, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
“Evidence was provided that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that...state institutions had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists processing postal ballots in order to stop the 'vote collection'.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for stricter checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving voters’ identity before voting.
Use ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from processing ready-made voices and envelopes sent by mail.
Allow the police to place guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal in polling stations.
Require that only English is used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that voters must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric beats the Greater London police force, saying it's "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The Electoral Court resigned Lutfur Rahman and his officers as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality," he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds, without any doubt, according to the threshold of criminal prosecution.
He also criticized the ineffective "tick-box checks" in city council voter registration offices.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy Kate's cyclist double and other celebrity portraits at the Olympics in Rio
This week, fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have become confused with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous doppelganger – at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the star of Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos of him appearing as scary as The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, when he became aware of the fanaticism of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard him look like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see much of a resemblance to myself, except maybe in terms of the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely come out again this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is "the sporty version" of Inception
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have the same strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more in common with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while US team Nathan Adrian resembles "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Hard women: Soccer star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw the similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between a pair
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter’s actress really have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes after Chinese swimmer says he's "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle message on Wednesday infuriated CBC's live Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian television company CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “disappeared like a bad smell” and “dead like a pig”.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began to share some of his own views in the women’s 4x200m freestyle final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC team to bring “color,” was heard saying, “That little 14-year-old from China was messing up, baby.
Too zealous, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck at the time of the second part of the message, giving Canada a chance to capture China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online, shocked by the language and tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'?"
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China's Ai Yanhan was portrayed in the women's freestyle 4 x 200 meters relay final as "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was swift and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and you're making us all sound like a racist group.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald’s comment, saying, “We’re sorry that the comment about the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC ended up apologising more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and posted an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the swimmer’s performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this very moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
Needless to say, I didn’t mean it disrespectfully, and I’m really sorry.”
Primark's client shocked by a woman who brazenly fits underwear in the middle of a store
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of a Primark store to try out her underwear.
Things were not improved by the fact that after evaluating what she looked like in her pants, she peels them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued twisting and eventually matched four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where she fit her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the store, said that after trying on lingerie, the mysterious woman “came back into her clothes and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took the pair’s underwear, took off her own pantyhose and underwear, and put on fitting legs.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for atonement, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone was staring at him while he was taking off his underwear, and obviously he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more pairs before finally deciding not to like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the panties he was wearing."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident of the town of Kent, said, “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t been cleaned.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes after the woman left, which is fine."
“It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and hasn’t washed them.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market.”
How to Defend Yourself from Armed Attacks with Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with gun-swinging robbers at close range.
Whether approached from the front or from the back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and “run the line of fire.”
After that, you grab a gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue hitting the knee in the groin, and when the attacker goes out of pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him with the back of the gun in the face, and retreat, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time, put pressure on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound tricky?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British tourist has placed a serious challenge on his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk-based host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button in a train toilet, and a Russian public phone to prove his immune system was strong.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called The Trace of Inner Power, yielded surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a tester of intestinal endurance as he traveled around the world and ate strange and miraculous things.
This task, from the railings of public railway stations to the toilet seat flush button, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film, he said, "Since I was a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth, starting with soil, worms, and dirt."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveller’s film, On the Trail of Inner Strength, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
Following the traces of inner strength, it was produced together with the Finnish dairy company Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to boost people's gut bacteria and immune system.
Valio’s Head of Snacks, Juice and New Categories, Niko Vuorenmaa, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary’s director Tom Hakala added: “Let’s say it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks saved."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they sometimes use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
A bugger family destroyed a rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The tycoon family caused <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to their rental house after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained about on numerous occasions.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found the property in poor condition.
There were gaps in the walls, the floorboards were torn, the waste was spread on the floor, and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family has now moved and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There is a lot to consider here, as this property is probably known through Cornwall’s less-comfortable groups.
This family is notorious, and their names are notorious."
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and police said the family’s tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug selling, and exaggerated screaming, quarreling, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease, was convicted of anti-social behavior.
Several rooms of the house under threat of demolition were found with old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs have previously been trafficked, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting in the street and police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forced the woman and her partner out of the property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to voluntarily move.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and things have always been bad.
We've seen the police here unbelievably many times.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down onto the wild wall of the apartment building.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and that of his family, since eviction is always the last policy Cornwall Housing has considered.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave community members who informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
A dirty mattress left on a one-bedroom floor after the eviction
Housing Company Workers Now Have to Clean Up Waste Stacks Surrounding the House
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as a scale, supplies and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for acquitting himself of possession of a class B drug with the intention of distributing it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are now homeless in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house had graffiti on their walls.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who are mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to disregard the rules.
“This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
The police in Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified when military jet flew low on shore
Sun-worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experience the shock of their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force swept past very low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came close to touching the sun worshipers on the sand strip of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise of the jet, although they did not see at first what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic bypass on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was crashing on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby ground fires, but the air force assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to low visibility conditions, smoke from ground fires, and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksote's first half-year result better than expected
In January-June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) achieved a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned.
Eksote’s result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the demolition of institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for action.
The exote covers a previously created deficit with a surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten queues and purchase procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Rangers swore an oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took an oath on Friday.
The military ballot of the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Limit Jäger Course was held at the garrison’s sports field.
70 conscripts took the oath.
Special border ice skaters are trained for demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border guard.
250 of them were invited to the test.
Special boundary ice skaters have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the Frontier Forces during the war participated in the meeting organised in connection with the election ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A bit ahead of the robber - Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had a RTA unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a sergeant stationed in the bay.
Chief of Staff is a Lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilian uniforms.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity,” says Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The creation of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would rarely leave the place of the whistles until they received the alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established, with fewer than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Crime Police in Vantaa, manages the operations nationwide.
As its name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided according to police departments and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiry extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because crime does the same.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar offences through registers, an alert mission database and observations.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools.
Everyone has their own way of working.
The handprint can also be seen in work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the manner in which it is done, the person creates a certain image.
The serialization can be done on the basis of either the method or the person, depending on which police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars upright, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no information on the methods used, either by the criminals themselves or by the criminals themselves, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police attempts to prevent crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the method of marking empty dwellings, reported in early summer, used in house break-ins.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin, or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material shall be public, at least for interested parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest ones will order a report from the district court, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found on the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen of Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola of Eastern Finland Police, Inspector Sami Joutjärv of Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela of the Central Criminal Police have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against the background of a decrease in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage reform of PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
Through national cooperation, information is collected outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
Schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is said to have died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl’s family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, an organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, died just as he was planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and will for others, that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone - that it could discourage people from making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid Says Clinton Will Consider Garland Supreme Court Candidate If He Is Elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland’s endorsement since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect Antonin Scalia to replace the late Supreme Court member.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted “with some degree of certainty” that Clinton would elect Garland.
A Reid spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team wouldn’t want to “swing the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland’s nomination were “servants” and “potentialists” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they’re going to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, the chairman of the Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude pictures differs from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's for them.
"We need to begin again to show the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these images of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys the records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with irritable insults written by the nickname NotAllIndividualMedium-agedMen, please note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-establishment of the albums is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but the yearning for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy records are those in the age group of 18-24.
And it’s not just about collecting, but it’s about feelings: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would signal vividly before I stopped, form a cup of my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's do a little more research."
Let's take a closer look.
While the charm and dirt of the Soho are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supplies stores now fill buildings that used to have independent stores - a handful of stunning specialized record stores remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I asked if he was a collector.
"I suppose I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (she sent the shot by email, I did not follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
The reason for getting such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he couldn’t afford when they were originally released, and he can re-purchase those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice.”
The 25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters match the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the albums have become fashionable again and who have come to have a need to buy back their old albums.
Based on the conversations I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakenings at a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured in particular by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the persistence of familiar record covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage happy days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects brings," Wez says.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" said another worker suddenly from the stack of discs.
A poll conducted by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably seem very concerned when I browse the stack of bossa nova collections.
This “reward” aspect of revival is something that Jonny, 42, working at Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men) has also noticed.
“Someone came in a little while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf.’”
This is not a big part, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people here who say, "I don't have a turntable."
So not the older ones, but the younger ones, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
The Foppi, which nowadays has almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned movements – the speakers are refreshed by Wild Beast’s latest synth and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisation jazz – it’s great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppa for a few minutes, looking at the various records on sale.
He's out shopping for windows, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I’m trying to look like I’m studying jeans shorts, I’m observing a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before dad and daughter think about buying Crosley’s record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyls".
But given that even the slightest attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It should come as no surprise that the section of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday mornings chessing around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy 30-year-old fake TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says the record is in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters tall.
French court rejects request to dismantle Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent a unpaid co-economy and because they are a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the camp’s growing population.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there is no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 people who run temporary trades, but said that the concern of the Prefect of Calais "was perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants had a much bigger role to play than simply feeding "people living in extremely uncertain conditions".
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which is a non-profit, offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children’s café.
A letter to the Guardian said that the closure of the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 — a peak — since the number of arrivals rose sharply over the summer.
Food prices in Finland are declining much faster than the EU average
Food is becoming cheaper in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the displeasure of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries the price of food on average fell by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen the second most in those EU countries that have similar wage levels as in Finland.
Only in the UK has food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on a post by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published in Tieto & Trendit -blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turnaround, after which the food became cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed down by Russian food import bans, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Tightened price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in the EU countries with similar wage levels as in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU level in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the EU average and continue to compete in prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
If you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan sets out the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, the teaching of craftsmanship is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies begin at the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of the students.
It was once thought that the teacher would teach the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It could live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is bypassed only by the Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to monitoring, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon timing.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-cm tall Amazonian fish, were discovered to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks reach sexual maturity only at ages over four meters, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired almost 300 salespeople
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be cut, most of them in the form of redundancies,” Stockmann said in a statement.
It states that the number of store vendors will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of the support functions will be offered a new job as sellers.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations involved about 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need for reductions was estimated at about 380 employees.
The population reduction aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store business continues to suffer losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Vice President and CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second-quarter performance improvement was mainly driven by Lindex’s good success.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, at the same time, the Stockmann Group as a whole had a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, HS meteorologist.
There will also be rainstorms in the central part of the country, but there will be rainstorms in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In rainy areas in the north it is 10-15 degrees Celsius.
Kenya’s Athletics Team Shocked by Doping Scandal – Curious Explanation for Coach’s Rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete for a doping test.
According to the AP, the athlete that Anzrah was trying to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, Kenya’s national team leader, said Anzrah’s identity had been revealed after giving a surprise test sample as Rotich.
Doping officials came to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he “committed a crime against the Kenyan national team.”
He acted as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour,” Kip Keino, the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right away.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth on the way to the World Cup last year and is one of Rio’s favorite winners.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah travelled with an athlete’s accreditation card just to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium 's
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, watching athletics.
The athletics medals contest started in Rio on Friday, but the world’s top figures were allowed to show off their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio’s organisers said on Friday that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets had been sold.
The second one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was cheering with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, rugby, canoeing and horseback riding have seen thousands of empty benches.
When Brazilian medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, they were only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian doubles, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12,000-strong team was only 30 percent full.
At least the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from reaching European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football, explains the bad sales.
However, even the Brazilian football team’s first match failed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, a figure that is much lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, despite the fact that tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have varied from around 9 euros to over 1000 euros during the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have issued 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
In the morning, the stadium was filled with empty seats.
Even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Get the Right to Land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
Individuals, companies and entities can then use money to redeem titles to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder gets a veto on the 187-square-square-square plot, which in practice means that not every holder needs approval if the land is to be changed for a different purpose.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring ownership is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of ownership for his company.
The person who has acquired the management right receives precise location data from the block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The names of the holders of rights are displayed on the Foundation’s website on the same map where the land block data can be found.
Leviäkangas sees as a risk of its nature conservation acquisition only that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is based on the idea of protecting natural areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation purchases land either by buying or by donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of titles, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the most in big cities - see the situation in your home town
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the most in Finland’s major cities.
There have been more bikes stolen this year than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat found out, on the basis of bike theft reported to the police, how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
There's a big difference.
"There are twice as many robberies in some cities in proportion to the population compared to others," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector at the Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the list.
It is very difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much people are riding on wheels and how many wheels there are in the city," says Sergeant Teemu Äikkäs.
The Finnish Police Board Tommi Reen expects that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts largely depends on what the study and cycling cities are.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where the city centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In all of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bike thefts reported to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts every year.
This means 50-60 fillers per day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes per year.
"It's a lot," Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report of bicycle theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police is reported.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be found during other investigations, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bicycles can be found in an apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with the crime itself or a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks in shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically anywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoi is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but many of the stolen bikes end up on the internet, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that there are very few stolen bicycles going abroad," Reen said.
Purchasers of stolen bicycles are ordinary Finns, according to the police.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a second-hand bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of concealment offences or concealment offences.
"The alarm bells should ring if a fit bike is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Special library official Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki every working day.
He has had five bikes, but none of them have been stolen," says Elk. "Never stolen, so a good monk has gone."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, it doesn't necessarily have a hipster value," says Elk from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was busy at a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now, the bike was pushing the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike in something fixed, like a bike rack.
"You have to think a lot about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"You hear from my friends all the time that the bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, such bad-ass jockeys."
A bicycle was stolen from the building a year ago.
The bike had not been locked, so Valve was expecting it to be stolen.
Under 15 years of age for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with US-famous peer-to-peer squads
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer sworn-in team is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The jury intervenes in the first offense committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator may join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other models of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everything is directed in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t go wrong from the first mistake,” says Laitio.
The peer-to-peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person after his first crime does not face an adult panel, but rather reflects on what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu service design agency who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first offences committed by children under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of Migrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want the Party to Stop Financing Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a draft to see it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to go to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking impopularity, threaten to bring Democrats to the polls in this election,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing every day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
Weinstein said the letter came from “people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress” and that it was not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will go well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handout to American labourers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the builders, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
“If a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the tax,” Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published in the Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "favoring only this kind of millionaire."
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cut, Clinton has previously called Trump “a loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded the audience of the small businessmen whose bills Trump has not paid and of the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are the audience figures of Rio: The Games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewer statistics.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a huge audience.
At one time, the Games have glued at best 12 per cent of the population to the screens: 615 000 viewers watched the Tuesday night swimming on Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Championships in athletics one month ago attracted nearly 800,000 spectators at a time and the European Championships in football attracted well over a million.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been cycling on Sunday night and rack gymnastics on the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle Panu Pokkinen, the head of sports, is pleased with the number of spectators and recalls that for the first time at the Olympic Games in Rio, the spectators are divided into several instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the percentage of television viewers who choose the Olympic Games at all.
On the TV side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When it comes to 24 hours a day, with between 20,000 and 500,000 viewers throughout, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s competition broadcasts will be in Finland at night.
Another reason for the diluted interest - if someone now considers it diluted - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is only just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of spectators has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, spectators explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the Apple App Store during the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're already at 200,000 downloads.
"We'll get our online audience figures later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been provided, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio are visible on Yle channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious to Yle ever, but also the last to be watched only on Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be visible on both Upper and Commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a 20 square meter depression in Ristikele, the bottom of which was a diving computer with a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to strengthen the observation by sonar.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess at 100 metres,” says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend over 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sunset.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been thoroughly mapped.
"There could well be unfamiliar depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, Päijänne cannot reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Repair 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: The last paragraph where the deepest lakes of medium depth were wrong was corrected.
Ihalainen: Taxation of pensioners continues to be tightened
Taxation of pensioners is higher than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came to light during the parliamentary elections and pensioners’ taxation was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income cuts that reduced taxation.
The matter warmed the representatives of the opposition in Parliament, who shredded the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb’s election promises.
Buying power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy on tax cuts presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about securing, not increasing, purchasing power, as next year salaries will not be increased.
He says tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is satisfied with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Orpo about their willingness to respect the competitiveness pact, which has been difficult to achieve.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be questioned.
It becomes necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own faith in the future.
Tackling prolonged unemployment in the barn
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget debate, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed in June was approximately 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
If growth does not stop, he says, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The travel season for Finns in Thailand starts at year-end.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy in Thailand has received some comments from Finns on Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out specifically to the Finns in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes the events may be linked to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, there were arrests of people who expressed opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
Previously, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
The city celebrates the Queen’s Birthday and Mother’s Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks would affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police say, according to the AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the last 24 hours as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded last night on holiday island Phuket, a tourist destination popular among Finns, reports the Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist resort of Hua Hin, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military junta, said the attacker had not yet been identified.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
"We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy tourism in the country because all the attacks took place in tourist areas.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the instructions of the Embassy on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims.
We've had a little bit more information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower.
Thai PBS said police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Thani’s bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
According to CNN, two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Thani, which exploded about half an hour apart.
The Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quads
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for rack championships at the Rio Games on the platform, jumping and boom.
Biles has mastered women's gymnastics to a degree in recent years.
He won eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and perm championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the previous year.
In the United States, Biles has won two team world championships.
Weaker World Cup medals at Biles are from jumping and booms.
Thai entrepreneur: “Isku has no impact on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children’s playground on the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more strikes, I don’t think there will be anything more surprising,” estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year the bombing in Bangkok.
If this has not been the case before, then this is not the case either.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. local time and said that it was not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought that the roadblocks had been set because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach had never heard of the attacks.
About half past three o’clock in the afternoon, the traffic in Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
The car was later seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men fit for identification, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately arrested.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thanked those who gave the hints.
Head of Research on Russian Leadership Changes: Clear Displacement
On Friday, the most prominent change of leadership in Russia took place in years, when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is Anton Vaino, a 44-year-old Estonian-born.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that recycling managerial positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov may have been in trouble with other leaders or have made a mistake.
Ivanov's defeat
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
In a tape released by the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace Persecution, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President’s Security Council.
During the Soviet era, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was elected president by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that the more interesting thing than the heir to Ivanov’s place is that Putin changes his close circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters use civilians as human shield when withdrawing from Syria
“They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of Manbij, an Islamic State city.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Correction of previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, civilians were abducted by ISIS fighters while they were fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but it is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Communications Director of the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Final Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time during the high-value races.
He broke his thighs early in the season and was forced to skip the Olympic Qualifiers in Jamaica.
This hasn’t been a perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
"I've practiced well and that's the key thing," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Porina around Bolt underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he was eliminated in the 200 m first round in 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young pledge slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, where he broke the world record and the self-confidence of his competitors in a time of 9.69 in spite of the final celebration.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career.
The Berlin world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200m world record and a 19-second record, but nobody but Bolt himself believes it will be.
Bolt’s biggest challenge is Athens’ 2004 Olympic 100-time winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the high-level finals, if only he could make it.
In Daegu, Bolt missed the <0x24>100 World Cup final in 2011 because of a deceitful departure.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set the final finish line of his career for next year’s World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older and it's harder.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,” Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of prohibited substances in a doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in the women's 100 m butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case before the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said that Xinyi's sample on Sunday showed evidence of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping allegations have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekov has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya has sent a trainer home for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during a test and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich's 800-meter race pass.
Nothing can stop Phelps - historical gold came to show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims in the 200 metres in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic gold medal in the same sport in the fourth consecutive Olympics.
Phelps won 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in mixed swimming before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs in Iltalehti's quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next up is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t stress much if there’s a little noise in the social media or in the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
“Television is a visual media,” he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a shorter dress that certainly has at least enough revealingness - at least to the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, there are no back steps.
It’s important to look good, and small courts are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure to want to cheer you up and maybe even cheer you up, but he insists he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the storm has reached all the way to Finland?
I can’t, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me.
You know what, man?
It’s a buzz out of nowhere if it comes from (the host’s) dressing up.
I'm a little amused if something like this hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said on Thursday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The arrests were made by the police in connection with the security controls.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that police arrested in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees allegedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence were circulated, among others, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
Police blew up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police allowed the public in after they controlledly blew up the package.
This is the third time in the history of the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not get to the stand by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and allowed the public to enter the hall only afterwards.
The drink woke up the Spanish team, which started the race sleepily.
With two defeats, Spain defeated Nigeria with 96 to 87 points.
In the last two races, Spain won the silver medal.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious finding near the road cycling finish line last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria have started their match in front of empty stands in the first round of the Rio Basketball tournament.
Argentine lady shoved Petäjä-Siren - Finnish protester
Tuuli Petäjä-Sireni had a colourful day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a hard time on Thursday.
The Argentine lady kicked Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He was stuck in a car crash and the others ran away, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete had long been protesting.
It was not worth it, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish driver was placed 27th in the race.
The 2012 London Olympic silver medallist is the eighth.
When it comes to the tip, the collision didn't really work.
Friday is an important day when we have to race 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Strange Things That Science Says Will Prolong Life
Science has explored everything between heaven and earth.
These things have been proven to add years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health in a way that prolongs his or her life.
Sometimes, things that a person can’t control can add years to his life.
These include a tendency to be obese or a social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don’t always have to go for it – just getting a can of milk is enough.
The secret of long life has been investigated by various studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all of these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially in the case of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption of one to three daily doses of alcohol may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine-drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of floss can prolong a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the onset of other diseases in other parts of the body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
When protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, many studies show that sex is good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
It will take more years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute slackness.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it’s an Olympic medal-winning athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some scientists suspect that longevity is due to a person’s social status – which, in turn, makes it possible to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 found that a person who shops on a daily basis was more likely to be less likely to be a parent than the one who shops.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to premature death.
Put your credit card down – online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver crashed into a truck.
On Friday evening, a serious cam collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koski, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koski, in the middle of Koskikent and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the car that met him had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained on its lane after the collision, but burned.
The driver was able to extinguish the fire himself.
The car slipped into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman, born in 1972, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of driving intoxicated.
Post sent candy to the wrong city.
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candy, as the post had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught my eye.
Unfortunately, there are product shortcomings in loose cakes, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti delivers the load!
Unless there was traffic in the lawn mowing, the sign said.
The merchant’s flipping sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The lawn cut is on Posti’s offer until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly funny and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the attention generated by this issue is unbelievable, Halt wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his favourites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti Enterprises Transport Services, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The reason is that three of the five stages got lost in the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we didn’t go to Salo with three more stages, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported by Evening-Say.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign, because she found all her loose candy favourites in the selection.
30 pounds lighter Lotta Backlund published a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has lost tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a photo of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and she was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project already in 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and has slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a photo of her performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After picture pair has collected several praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We’re on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, as I travel the same way, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last kilos with the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach normal weight, which was 10 kilograms away at the time.
During the three-month exercise course, the pounds eventually fell to five.
Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembrance of the victim for the police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations to police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed a nursing training there.
Veterinarians remember the woman with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor and fearless of work.
A good friend.
We still can't fully comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The suspect, a 27-year-old man, did not know the woman and did not have any connection with her.
The killer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
Börje survived and is recovering.
District court sentences Posti for violation of equality law
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court judged in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the detained salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only the part of the orientation counsellor’s salary that corresponded to the part of the orientation counsellor’s full-day work.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the organisational decision of the Postal and Logistics Industry Union PAU on the introduction ban.
During last November’s postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees will not introduce temporary agency workers who break the strike.
This was first reported in the People’s News.
Turkey returns to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Centre) in their reply to the Association of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the association asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for the freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression in Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration – replaced by Estonian-origin Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, will replace him.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin’s statement, Ivanov, one of Putin’s close insiders, will take on special tasks in the fields of environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace Persecution, Russia Today said.
Ivanov co-operated with Putin in the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Ivanov was considered by many to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was succeeded by Dmitry Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's Giant Purchase Banned - Not Seen at Premier League Opening
The world record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from England.
Manchester United's outright acquisition of Paul Pogba has been suspended from ManU's opening of the league against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said Friday.
ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million to Juventus, according to British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game because Pogba was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-match ban.
The ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play will be in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, greatness is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions for entertainment have established Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event, starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festival goers have typically expressed themselves in their distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival is styled with artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
Behind the success lies a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in the production of events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 by 70,000 last year.
This year, the festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle steered by huge avenues.
We don't want that.
For 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area, partly decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year the venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that even large visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, in the middle of the 2000s, the activities depended heavily on the support of the City of Helsinki of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, Flow’s limited liability company’s turnover was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "greek things," such as the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in their distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
First and foremost, we want to stand out in content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of the punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival, which combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was bukkake, because this is probably the last time we will see this at a gig in Finland.
We care about everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been making damn good gigs over the last few years.
Bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
Two local time bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted an extensive picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two local time bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon afterwards, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also favored by the Finns.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, the bombings are likely to be carried out by insurgents who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have been keenly engaged in the activities of criminal organizations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are only ordered to fight until several months after they have taken the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Head of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible for combat in a war situation.
According to the Head of Training, the first reservists to be assigned are those in the standby force.
No conscript or reservist will be ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier this summer it appeared that the Finnish Defence Forces will begin training conscripts for immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, the units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation for homestay
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused harmful microbial flora.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to 132,000 euros, which resulted in financial losses for Tola and Waroma of as much as 198,000 euros.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the District Court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47,344 for the couple’s legal and settlement costs.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because some of the need for repair had already been known to the buyers at the time of the purchase.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors in the construction were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
She was looking for a good home.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a fit home because they did not want to take up repair work.
He had the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that the issues mentioned in the health inspection report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and inconveniences of ventilation and the inadequate control of rainwater and melting waters spilling along the rock surface.
However, it was not clear from the discussions that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that the rainwater coming from the cliffs should be managed a little bit within a few years.
The transaction took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which according to witnesses was caused by both the rock’s rainwater and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could also enter indoors through the porch, according to the inspector.
Health-risk-enhancing mold or yeast that exceeded the limit values was found in the scrubbing samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the living room window erker and the basement washroom.
Terraces built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that before the sale, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home issues were a central issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major renovations in the near future.
Tola and Waroma were of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that there was no special reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Scary archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finnish women in the register
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives in Maryland, USA, has microfilmed records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
Documents and registration cards are from the National Race Office in Nazi Germany.
The Breed Office was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women who had to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were undergoing gynecological examinations to find out.
The racial agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by examining church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the family tree of women.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed office handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The breed office wanted guarantees that the women were “child-loving,” “spareful,” and “good National Socialists” who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program stipulated, among other things, that every SS man should have four children, whether in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographics focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between “Aryans” and “non-Aryans” were prohibited by law, the museum’s website says.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, the nerd rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third at the first departure of Finnjollie’s day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained at the top of the team’s tail on the second departure of the day.
He was eighth overall after five runs, but failed in the second run to drop him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures in 17th and 3rd place.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were 23rd in the day’s opening.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Tale was recorded with a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so stubborn"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish artists’ favourites for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää continues to play and is currently in a fierce state of affairs.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Nude, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgenpää’s career rose to full cheer when he won the crown of the tango king at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so stiff!
The bridge in the book.
The recording of a song that became a huge hit would not immediately suggest that it was sung with a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, it was still a good impression.
I learned that you don’t have to be perfect and perfect all the time.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then-partner and the case ended up in the lyrics of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmäinen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making an album that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, it was based on the news in the 7 Days magazine.
In the newspaper news, the reason for Jari’s separation from his ex-lover was said to be excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was bullshit and not true.
According to the book, Jari was furious when he called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually he ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of voters were in favour of the split and 48 per cent would have stayed in the Union, even though polling during the week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged in favour of the divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” flew into the rubbish bin in Britain’s Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked that the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professional answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists’ loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the real British.
Many people also believe that a decline in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it will boost the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly affected by the BBC’s fairness, which gave just as much room for EU-backed economists representing only a few percent of the economist population as for the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic combinations think about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom voters, in their opinion, have no common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming win-win argument in the Brexit vote was immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant congests your hospital, the immigrant exploits you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign employees in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a British doctor if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that due to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues for health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
In Aberdeen, he said, Brexit was prepared in a timely manner by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the EU-pro-exit camp, began to be more prepared a few weeks before the vote, in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we held 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open-to-listed real estate fund on a daily basis that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest rate in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds have closed trade.
When the EU-backed camp won, Europe got confused.
However, the few weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freezed its trades.
Together, they rallied the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position due to the cash raised, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trades for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling the money out in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you do not have to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and the majority withdrew the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite even, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar upheaval in Aberdeen's Continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closure of real estate funds’ trading operations received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about four per cent of UK real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties in its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds to the end of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been pushed downwards, but the situation does not seem to be "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit hits the property market in London
At two o’clock in the morning, things didn’t look so good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word you got.
I realized that this is going to be on the side of plan B," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was still alive in the morning.
TV screens, normally silenced in the office, swirled the news, and usually loud crowds were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron walked in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened up, the displays flashed all red.
It was a morning you never thought you would be alive, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins with corrections
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the real estate market in the UK and especially in London.
London offices were expected to have up to 20% minuses in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after the other.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the thunderstorm has subsided, but uncertainty is still raging in the air.
It does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will occur and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first reported.
CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London office buildings accounted for 6.1 per cent of the minus, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the similar drops occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared to the collapse of Lehman and the global financial crisis that began in the US real estate market.
In Vanhanen's view, the comparison is not entirely appropriate, as this is the UK's domestic crisis.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has not seen such panic sales at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is found normally.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, a price correction is no wonder to him - it could have been without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started very high.
London prices have risen for four reasons, Vanhanen says.
The British economy has grown strongly, and the population of London has also grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will globalize, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for income in new destinations.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, leverage has now been used much less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was a turnaround, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the UK economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but he says that there is hardly any prospect of an upward spike.
The mood indicates that there is a descending or steady course ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that work can make it out of the pit.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of a victim.
If it has been decentralized, then the risks have been decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S-Group begins to register shopping information more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you’re eating, as the merchant group announced today that it will start collecting even more detailed information about its regular customers’ purchases.
Up to now, when information has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it from the purchased products as well in early May.
S-Group follows Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has already been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and is used for marketing purposes subject to consent.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, says Riitala to Talousanoim.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in S-Group registration.
Kesko categorizes its regular customers in ten groups according to their grocery purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is currently planned.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Loyalty Program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect information on product or product group levels, we remain at the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know which store the purchases were made in and on which day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K Group or S Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is planned to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise to start the registration of product information.
Initially experimenting
So far, SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and addresses, the basic data also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the location, the total amount of purchases and the payment method are stored.
In addition, the data of the S-bonus partners are derived from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodi’s Terroi and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time now, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs’ newest dog reinforcement – the puppy becomes the first dog to detect explosives
The black labrador’s puppy sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It will not be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of fragrant casings of powdered gas was discovered.
Powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now,” says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the exploration of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main place of work in Heila, as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels triggered measures in Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened," said Finnish Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for training an arms and explosives detection dog in Customs’ tasks is postal consignments that pass through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, from online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and postal items.
In the future, it will be of great benefit in ports, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive detection dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila also attend training sessions with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs decides together with other authorities what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include keenness and hunting, as well as serenity, because the dog has to deal with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t get anywhere at home without him, he laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from a one-time lake.
The cameraman loses the camera mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the mic cover that looks like a soft toy immediately from the "untie" command.
Strong competition for working dogs
Heilan’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still exams ahead, next in October, in which it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
You can see Heilan at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio recalls.
The cost of one working dog for Customs is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire under the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dogs are the owners of hard competition in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
The lucky spot was Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but she has years of experience with dogs and controlling tasks at Customs.
Mini-State Receives First Olympic Medal – People Get a Day Off
With less than a million people, Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
Fiji's government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The rugby team of Fiji celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital, Suva, where a screen had been set up at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," said Maikele Seru, a reporter for the Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer faints after a fierce performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at a weight loss of 175 kg after a tough fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During, or immediately after, he has fainted several times.
No one really could say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilograms for pushing and 145 kilograms for sweeping.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to push 175 kilos in the final, as well as the second one.
In the third attempt, the weights were raised, accompanied by fierce roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Itta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men’s football league, has signed a long-term contract with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player with strengths and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players-agents.
Slowly Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS came in need of a new striker when last season's country king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
'Modern Family' star shrugged again: teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as Alex Dunphy in the modern Family comedy series, is once again showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don’t leave much to your imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has been posing in pictures published on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very scarce outfits.
On the eve of adulthood, Winter has recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for most of his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood receives, Palmer says, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has infuriated some of his long-time fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so strong,” a woman said on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look gorgeous!
I don't care what the others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fabulous mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations of Northern Lights tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump card of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season begins early in autumn and continues far into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight two times more fairy-tale, says Anne Lind, Visit Finland’s chief marketing officer.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35 year olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by, for example, online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more distinct and unique sights from Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights has tremendous potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have increased in Finland much more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fid’s master class leading to gold
Britain’s impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed into Fiji’s final challenge in Thursday night’s final, when the team suffered a 43-7 crush loss at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji arranged a master class in reading, chewing, evasion, support game, running lines, and sheer force while winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
With the defeat came a reasonable consolation from the silver medal - the third of the British Day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby opening tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tough 7-5 win over South Africa in the semifinals played earlier that day might have bothered them in the final.
Despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
Britain may – but probably not – be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fid’s head coach is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England at Wimbledon.
The trip to Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
They only lost one here.
This spanking hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off brilliantly by rejecting British tacks for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running against moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinsau dive into the finish line at the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tack stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was only a slowdown for Fiji.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, with Britain losing 17-0.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the watch...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the loose tacks in Great Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the break, the score was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
During the break, the United Kingdom made dozens of changes that blocked Fid's dam...for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive assist.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK in the left corner of the touchdown, narrowing it down to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid’s joyful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute paint had a frosting in Fidi's cake, which didn't need frosting.
They whistled, the Fidians hugged, and Britain fell on the grass, totally beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had defeated Japan in the semifinals 20-5, and Britain defeated South Africa in the tight semifinals, where each scored one goal - Britain's goal kick determined the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goal poles in the second half.
A great late strike from Marcus Watson, brother of England’s 15-side rugby team Anthony, secured victory and eventually a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer pushed Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There will be no more emotion-inspiring gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first to the last, with 220 tough pulls towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, there were three sounds on the boat, and Coach Robin Williams’ echo was present all along as the duo announced their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in a women’s pair competition – the first women in the British sports history books to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining a swan on the surface with grace, does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind every rowing gold there is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start her treatment in early 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that term can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thing the couple thought of was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced Afghan captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, said, “I’ve been a emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I, and Robin, have worked together.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anything, so thank you very much, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their rivals could not reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very close in the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything special.
We weren’t looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for good rowing and winning the race, and that’s what we did.
The couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland Replaces Panama Leaked Government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which will be demanded by protesters in the spring following Panama leaks.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the June presidential elections, the criticism of those in power was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has cancelled his latest speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President-elect Barack Obama was the founder of the Islamic State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious and demanded an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink so low to become a commander-in-chief of the army,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of a Muslim-favoured burkini swimsuit on beaches, according to the Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear that exudes religious affiliation may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only blue algae turbidity has been detected at the Pyykösjärvi beach.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the Meriniemi shore, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the waters of Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the intervention limits.
The blue-green algae turbidity observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae bloom, forming blue-green algae mass on the water surface in rafts.
The environmental action follows the situation through increased inspections.
If the blue algae turbidity turns into blue algae blooms, the message board of the bathing area will also be notified.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen from forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s next year’s budget proposal.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal to reduce forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the tax amendment proposal.
The forest gift reduction is proposed to be based on the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income less all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales of wood.
The VM’s proposal starts from that, by making a deduction from the pure capital income of forestry, it prevents the loss of the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model applies only to a small number of forest owners.
The limit for tax deduction linked to the value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It seems to have been pulled too high.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction, he said.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
Forest policy has been taking forest gift reductions for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hail surrounds drivers in Himanga – two cars crashed into a ditch and crashed into each other
Kalajoki Himanga suffered a special rear-end hit on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive cars slipped into a ditch, after which the one at the rear collided with the one at the front.
According to on-call fire chief Harri Pyyhtiä, the fall into the ditch is suspected to have been caused by strong hail.
There were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information on their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku may help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings of the research group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of anticancer treatments by focusing not only on cancer cells, but also on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications, in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’ family home killing continues at court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for second offender
The family home killing of Muhos continues at the court in respect of both sentenced persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family homicide in Muhos.
The other was sentenced to eight years and four months for, among other things, murder as a young person and gross robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of murder was also convicted of serious endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle without rights as a young person.
The judgement of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who had been sentenced more severely.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as the head of the school’s child protection unit in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked the director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The instructor had gotten out of his grip and led the young man to his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind survey, both convicts were in full comprehension at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to leave the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, growing only at the age of 156
The world’s longest living vertebrate is confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
An ice shark that swims in the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female reproduces only at the age of 156.
Ice sharks live longer because they only grow one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists were able to determine the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The eldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although the throw in one direction or the other could be up to 120 years old.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need the rest of the world.
Up to one-third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s proposed change to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced by tax relief, particularly for the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as “revolutionary” when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without it, there would be a huge amount of money, <0x24>1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate now stands at 39.6, after Trump’s reduction of 33 percent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
Urgently decided environmental standards must be re-established and energy deregulation abolished.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "specialists instead of bureaucrats".
“Devastating” trade policy is one of the major causes of U.S. problems.
The Free Trade Agreements will be abolished.
Imports from China will be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and imports from Mexico of 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will oversee the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike Trump, he faithfully read through the speech written by his assistants, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists – including those close to Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program on Friday.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is in a state of turmoil, but a true tsunami strikes in the middle of Madrid's streets - the settlement of the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty.
Almodovar's previous work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a funny satirical comedy, preceded by The Skin I Live in (2011) the top of my career as a Spanish singer.
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama, focusing on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is largely seen as a long retrospective.
Life seems to be the case for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a backlash and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, acquainted with Julieta as a young teacher from the series The Time between Ommelte (2013-2014), will become the second female protagonist.
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a tricky way, but I personally would say that time is crafty and literally a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and Almodóvar films, which are often characterized by such blurring and humour.
It is an evenly acted, restrained, place with good music in some places, and quite sad, with elements of gesture as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is still there, and it starts to catch the eye more slowly as a pure form fact than a working dramatic effect.
The film’s characters suffer from illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface stays the same.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a title person, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same goes for spectacular ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the set-up of the scene, does not improve much.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and somewhat breathless.
Almodóvar has written the script based on three short stories by the Canadian author Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat uniform literary filmization.
The material would have been an emotionally incomparably more robust drama, so many big things – especially the gnawing guilt – are covered in the theme of the film.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's premiere is on 12 August.
Government tries to run elections - People's News
No further cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be massive.
There will be no further cuts.
The <0x24>4 billion saved is enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (coll.) say during the budget debate.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits meeting.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment benefit and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earned unemployment benefits will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Educational cuts continue.
Elections are haunted
Why are the ministers so eagerly insisting that no further cuts will be made on them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the results of the municipal elections in different directions by the governing parties ruin the government’s mood for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the Government Party expects the Finns to lose, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party of Perus received 752 new delegates, most of whom will realise the cost of influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties of approximately equal size depends on the fact that the basic Finns have a strong temper.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s visitation hall have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric of no new cuts, firstly, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out in a drastic manner and, secondly, attempts to soften the blow awaiting the basic Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year’s time, everything will probably be different – if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of breaking down indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will raise 5.9 billion euros next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: indebtedness will not break down or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance in 2018, and then in the parliamentary elections in the spring we will receive what is coming.
With these measures, indebtedness does not stop
It is quite clear that with current measures, indebtedness will not be reversed, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to inspire a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki in the budget’s Awareness Conference are irrefutable proof of this:
The growth forecasts for the global economy have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly recovered since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy conducted at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent during this decade and has increased from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
According to the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left Alliance’s debt bailout was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be approximately EUR 6 billion, which will be covered virtually entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Questionnaire: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four think that the municipality is responsible for organising childcare, youth work and physical activity, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Sector Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also shifts responsibility to a single municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
For the county, it is most obvious that it is responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to delegate to the state any tasks that are the responsibility of the municipalities.
Minor drunk driver runs away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol to Ilomantsinki on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle running without lights, but a young man ran away from the police at a fairly high speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from where to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman ran for the fugitive.
The driver’s breath test showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to traffic safety.
A truck loaded with stones fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stones crashed into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a bend to the left and fell to its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through a door above it together with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the car owner.
A crashed truck spilled hydraulic oil onto the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahdenkylä, in southern Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a slender, slender woman with white hair that reaches under her chin.
Findings and clues about the movements of the missing person are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre hotline 0295440513.
Ingredients of a major disaster in the air - see photo gallery
The flooding of Parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, the chairman of Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get back on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market at the end of Friday evening.
The programme will continue on Saturday with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program is organized as planned.
A surge flow occurs in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a decreasing airflow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm cloud bind heat, and consequently the declining air mass cools and its speed towards the earth accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there will be several surges in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the course of the surge.
A surging current struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5:00.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported to further care, slightly injured.
Air pollution ages Londoners
Research has shown that Londoners’ skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The study was conducted by the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of, say, a peer who lives in rural areas.
Skin ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollutants that originate from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Caci’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk around busy streets on their commute.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man in front of him
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man did not get hit, but the tractor pushed him enough that he was taken to the central hospital for further examinations, seriously injured.
The tractor could not drain further, as it collided with the stones in front of it.
Fast forward with new strength for the coming season
Joensuu Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Champions League, will start the series starting in October from better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
There is certainly a better common tone than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Middleback Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is a passari, while the Brazilian is 198 centimeters.
Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all World Championships since 2003.
The sixth race is now taking place in Tampere, only 2013 missed better than Canada in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was the founder of the national team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, a sport like the stadium bandy was not yet played at the SM level.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later I played ice hockey in Jokipoj in the Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the 1991-92 season of the Finnish Floorball Championships, and spent the next three seasons in Josba.
While playing, he trained the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women’s championship, with a balance of 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen nominated for the national team
Joensuu club Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was chosen to play in the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before this, where she has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from his thighs and is part of the national team’s standard equipment with 117 matches.
Mika Kohonen was nominated for the national team, who was last seen wearing a Finnish shirt at the World Championships last December.
The head coach of the national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach volley championships will be held in Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During the three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs from each series will qualify for the SM Final.
The local colour of the tournament is Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki NMKY, who has been one of the top beach volley players in Finland for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be there this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming up for the pesesistadion.
I haven’t played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu’s spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in NMKY E-Girls.
The main thing in mind is a too big shirt, knee pads rolling around on the ankles, as well as amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasu's beach volley was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior age.
The beach in Kurärälampi has been playing bits since the 1990s.
The action has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors’ SM-tournament competitions, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays alongside Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäkelä in the Finnish Championships.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo is clear.
A realistic goal is a medal.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize drawer, Hasu mysteriously throws.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament in Kisakallio.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, says Hasu.
Falling current knocked down tents at an event for disabled people in Joensuu, a major accident was close

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweating and being energetic.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started their activities as the successor to their home farm almost two years ago.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Becoming a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything at stake.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a garden house, and the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I took part in the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it,” Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have the faith to produce clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Salomon Koli’s goal is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for young food producers of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You will be able to vote for him on the newspaper’s website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero since last year’s October when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Average annual inflation, measured by the Life Cost Index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The life-cost index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the price of the following consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in almost ridiculous ways.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are simple, facial twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized for promoting a blackface mask, or preferring a bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised for some users this week a lens that gave them skewed eyes, skewed teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people -- a "yellow face" or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring controversies could be a sign of the company’s bigger problem with diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for the observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was widely distributed, said in her email that the lens was “at least offensive and uncomfortable.”
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison between an outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects next to each other."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to the extreme of defamation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge audience of racially diverse young people may mean that they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an insulting image, “it’s much harder for these guys to be inconspicuous.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his paper for Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s mainly white male leadership and ended his work with the hashtag <0x23>DeleteSnapchat (<0x23>RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they aren't in positions where they feel safe or can speak out."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and push internal inclusion efforts forward.
For his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "Is it that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
Congress Panel Says Military Officials Falsified ISIS Intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel said the U.S. military headquarters had edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than was justified on the ground.
A mid-term review report by a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House of Representatives’ Defence Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Sub-Committee found “wide-spread dissatisfaction” among headquarters intelligence analysts who said the superiors thumped their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as the Centcom, is the Armed Forces Military Compartment Headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outputs typically endorsed by higher-ranking Centcom executives gave a more positive picture of the US’s counter-terrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground. They were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community contributors,” the report said in a press release.
“The events at Centcom are unacceptable — our fighters in the war suffer when poor analyses are presented to high-level decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts feeling as if Centcom leaders were putting pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters' press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could even begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated intelligence outputs from the headquarters to undermine the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, is followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense Chief Inspector has opened an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's inquiry.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence assessment by ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s chief democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs", worsened the mood among analysts, and did not "give enough room for divergent views."
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into “pre-established or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector-in-chief has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector’s investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential topics of national security.”
The investigation has other repercussions than just the question of whether US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the war activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a controversy over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, the Hooker group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy by building temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at headquarters.
United States wins fourth consecutive women's field hockey match with Britain
The day after having scored three goals when the team defeated Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women’s field hockey team on Thursday when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings."
But here’s what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group’s first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarter-finals, and this game determines who will finish first and who will finish second in their team of six.
The first-placed avoid a strong Dutch, the second-group leader, slightly longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, the Americans have been stirred by their surprising success here, four years after being last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up at Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played at Drexel), joining the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not qualify for the final list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a complete reversal.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half goal with a knockout close to the goal.
India had not won a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then turned to the center and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the tournament's first US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, to score one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good spirits.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good situation now," Parnham said, "but its goodness will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace in the midst of Olympic excitement
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are underway.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be continuous and inevitable, a fierce message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming message stick, transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlet.
It’s impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in line at a cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-timer and future heartbreaker of the Olympics with a smile pit, could well be one of the names that everyone is familiar with in the prime time of the year, and that is backed by sponsorship agreements and good-humor TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since its debut at the Sydney Games in 2000, there has been so little observation of its presence over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realise it was an Olympic sport.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals.
However, the trampoline has a certain underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, I am just a non-flight fan.
There are opportunities for amusement, as can be seen from the vibration of the endless bounces of cartoons, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming, two sports that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a springboard.
The championship seekers jumped on a gigantic trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet, and they must perform spinning movements (turns, folds, and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged on the basis of execution, difficulty and "flight time".
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those wishing for a medal must go further, faster, up and over in search of gold - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are hunting not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television broadcasting, for another ridiculous border: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even make the viewer cry.
But that’s also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest from this.
The trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises again, seeming weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this is not lacking in competition and difficulty, but during the program there will be no furious rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, only a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It’s as close to Zen as you can get at the Olympics.
The women’s qualification competition and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 1 pm (ET), the men’s competition will also be on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon programme starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic thrill, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"A generation of protesters" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable nations, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading into more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Spread, demonstration-recorded videos, which are believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how young people are being beaten with sticks by security officials while they are being forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN’s chief human rights authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopian people in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously, and the capital, Addis Ababa, even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have consistently spoken of repression by the government, the country's opposition has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven to a remote desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to protest, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university professor in Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth is demonstrating.
A generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the power of the ruling coalition.
After the much-criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat held by the opposition and now occupies all seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the upheaval and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of effervescence under the surface, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through location-hidden online proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhars, get along better.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharics, who came from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, thrived in politics and business, taking advantage of the Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The biggest demonstrations have taken place in the Amharic and Oromo regions.
Many Amharics and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors to harm opponents.
"The present government has no such basic instinct," said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in this turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested over elections that, according to analysts, appeared to have been first flogged and then plundered by the government.
In the subsequent repression, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure design, such as the new commuter train, and for significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the internal escalation of disdain for the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigers, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed the base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing act."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Based ISIS Claim as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the controversy over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming he wasn’t serious when he repeatedly urged this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in an awkward position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following an insinuation at a Wednesday night campaign meeting, Trump made the same assertion with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday’s interviews, in which he urged that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that he was sarcastic.
The release was a complete turnaround from the day before when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign on the economy in the midst of declining opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought over the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the issue.
Running back to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, after facing widespread criticism apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "I'm sarcastic, of course."
The approach allows Trump to go to the frontiers of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears out' in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has tracked the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he’s cunning about his statements and knows they’re vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of softening his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been more gallant in recent days as his popularity continues to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump lags behind Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny over the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, put a lot of effort into defending the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, totally wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to tweet an attack on the news media, which is bullying his every word and biased against him.
He mocked the “bad, pathetic” television experts who are trying to figure out him out, saying, “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse as new evidence that he was unfit to be president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a sloppy, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn’t have a wireless network, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the streetside of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals regretted it as the latest loss in a middle-class town to be renovated.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unrefined atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him at the new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought an espresso machine of the same model.
It even used the lights of the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches and covers with, for example, capers and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but they make fresh juices.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady flow of old regular customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers, too," he said.
One Sunday ago, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a cafe.
He says that after the Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verbi's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he’s back to coffee, although that day he ordered a blended chai drink instead of his regular iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He used to go to work there. He always made the same order.
“Every day at fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagels with butter,” he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, for a change, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he has no grudge against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verbi, which would use refrigerated coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we can still seize the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it on a spot soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juicer wants to bottle and sell cold extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it’s enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and he said it was distressing when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home walking in and ordering a coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: Depression Paralyzing Food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods such as goose liver patties and Maryland marsh turtle soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a culinary demonstration of solidarity with the people who are suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman's book 97 Orchard, was about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will release on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some kind of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato puree and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating during the depression.
"The worries were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut nutmeg, liver nutmeg, bean nutmeg.
They were made from an ingredient and some inexpensive ingredient that extended the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make your dinner.
Coe's a grin.
"It must have felt like lead heavy in my stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession, the Americans’ tables, especially in the countryside, were like a eat-as-a-lot-like pick-up table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The book A Square Meal chronicles the way the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes such as scones and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was “a great way to use scraps,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compounds were tried because calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While also conducting research for a book with recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgetizers” and respond to the challenge of transforming lumps like purée spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
The Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s ‘let me eat cake’ attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowa-style country food of his childhood, he dined like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own belly.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only one of Washington's poorest, but also the worst-prepared food."
Many of the depression eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a striking name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged their spoons into the sticky, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe slammed once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for attorney's fees in the hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A U.S. court has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to legal fees in connection with a hepatitis C patient dispute against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from payments of <0x24>200 million for breaking two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's success drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. This exemption followed when an American judge discovered Merck's misconduct, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict filed on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to be exempted from any compensation it had incurred in opposing the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of sofosbuvir, a drug used in Gilead.
U.S.-backed forces say they have taken over Manbij, wholly controlled by ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have completely occupied the northern town of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 sieve hostages held by the fighters, Sharfan from the SDF’s ally Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"We have full control of the city now, but we've begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned <0x24>10.7 million in 2015, paying 34.2 percent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his wife earned <0x24>10.7 million that year, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speech allowances, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received <0x24>3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton published 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
U.S. presidential candidates are required to publish their tax returns even though they are not legally required to do so.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for refusing to publish tax returns.
"It's your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special advisor, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by publishing an online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: publish his tax returns," he said.
The Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little tax in two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax attorneys and accountants on Friday saying the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Clinton would make sure those who earn more than <0x24>1 million a year pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also under review by the tax administration and that Trump is not “fearing” the tax office, but the voters.
Clinton’s campaign has issued tax returns until 2007.
The actual federal tax rate for Clintons living today in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s tax return for 2015 showed that only <0x24>100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment portfolio was an inexpensive, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported <0x24>109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks enhance Tanzania’s elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from migrating to human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, who came up with the idea several years ago in collaboration with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and crops without hurting animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...the tools, we have noticed a change in attitude in these communities, which are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Honeyguide's executive director, in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing an intruding elephant with a flashlight and playing a trumpet.
If it does not stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and fireworks, after which the condom is twisted so that only the ignition wire is visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts and blows up chili powder into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with a Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel’s country code, according to the employee, this is due to “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, exploded his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country code list offered by the hotel in Israel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker brought the matter up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response received from there "wounded him."
The hotel’s prescriber said it was “a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the decision was even more outrageous for the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli area code," Lanzmann said.
Israel’s German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the incident a “great injustice,” the Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
“We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But even more shameful is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident provoked quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “submitted” to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame," said another publication, which noted that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied the allegations and called the incident "negligence" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"The clear order not to include Israel on the shortcut list was never made," Kempinski's spokesman said, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
Students confronted police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students gathered to protest against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to dismantle the student population, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their horror of the plans.
According to São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of São Paulo, just under 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after protesters marched together to support President Dilma Rousseff, who had been suspended from office, while the Senate voted on her indictment.
RT Business: Russia-Iran trade increases by 71%
Since the lifting of the sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, said Levan Dzhagaryan, the Russian ambassador to Iran.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new ones are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling <0x24>856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
“Trade growth was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was for the first time among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia.
"I think it's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will break," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner plunges into the finish line while Britons grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner won the men's team sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night when the British team's trio defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was the anchor in the role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man when he reached the finish line, snatching a favorite win from the New Zealand team.
Britain won a shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly finishing sixth at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held in view of the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set the Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
After his own round, Hindes was a little behind, but Kenny pushed him to lead the team, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included driving Hindes in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "Comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the World Champions.
It was absolutely unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like being in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Given Kenny’s decency, it’s not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s exploit of winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympic Games.
That would mean that the total number of medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny is next to compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this one.
A team competition is always the best.
It will be won with friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the knighthood."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man, four-kilometre team run.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 London World Gold Record is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before qualifying, when officials called him for a length measurement.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavi’s world record time, with the clock stopping at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to rely on its powerful track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympic Games and win a whole series of medals.
After performing a truly exceptional and perfect performance in Beijing and London, expectations have been undermined before the Rio Games.
There has been a drama behind it, not the least of which has been the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and temptation, and the end of the racing career of prominent figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation could once again reach its peak at the perfect moment.
Portland smelter's future is questionable due to cuts in electricity contract
The future of Portland’s Victoria aluminum smelter, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when a power company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the factory’s owners is about to terminate the distribution agreement, so a cut in all distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows a decision by the Victorian administration earlier this year not to extend the subsidies required for the operation of the plant.
The 20-year subsidy period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be endangered, directly or indirectly, by the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the smelter at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter is losing money and under threat of closure.
The measure follows several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which started as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of the factory’s production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to terminate their contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, while the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the meltdown plant's physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called “defense agreements” that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to yield results for the financial year 2017," the power company said.
All possible impacts on AGL from FY2018 onwards are currently limited by strong outlooks for the electricity wholesale futures market.
AGL said it had already "foreseeably" depreciated the value of contracts in its accounts by <0x24>187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter operational or secure the smelter's electricity supply."
The U.S. firm said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the contract was due to come into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been alert to the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both factories leave the market, it will be a significant reduction in market demand.
For us as electricity producers, that would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just a reality TV star from the Kardashians, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the wanted September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model for Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Watching this cover in a room full of people I love made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted reality video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and everyone's favorite entertainment uncle Ryan Seacrest, the Keeping Up producer), forgot their sister's cover, but it ended in a classic turnaround.
It’s the cliché storyline of almost every children’s television show’s “birthday episode” (Seacrest says “I guess you didn’t think we’d forget you” with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny), but Kris had to somehow get her other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered a new Kardashian era with the seat of the September Vogue.
Kendall’s older sister, Kim, may have made the case for Vogue first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite different.
Vogue’s September issue is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles more a coffee book than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, 615 of last year’s 832-page book was advertised).
Its cover star is expected to be revealed so heavily that, for the past two years, pictures of the magazine have leaked before official release.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have actually been more "celebrities acting as models" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior’s ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga’s place of honor.
But if Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "success model" of his generation, hit the first category, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all that).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
This feeling came to the surface again with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But turning around in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's make-up.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she is a reality TV star.
Community legal centres reject 160 000 people each year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable populations are displaced from the European legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its already-extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunity to fight unfair evictions, and the like - are already being turned away in search of free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said in a recent National Association of Community Legal Centres census report that thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“The community legal centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unjustly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their client communities, and the Palaszczuki Government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign’s North Carolina operations chief threatened an employee with a gun in February while driving in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordin, a former state-run software intern, on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip “took out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experiences with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused indignation when he told the public in North Carolina that the “people of the Second Amendment”—which usually includes gun owners and gunmen—could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he was not in favour of violence.
The Bordin challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the request.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.

Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings revival and prosperity to the entire stomach, not just to local communities and around London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we put in a huge effort to ensure that all our people and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Just like before the 2012 London Games, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for a race and that we would be ashamed in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: from the T5, voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, to the T2 built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It’s time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employability that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce for the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in Cat and Mouse Play to Block Advertising
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass an ad-blocking program are a “cat and mouse game,” said one of the companies that make such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on their computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying users could update the program’s filters to block ads again on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code would be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back and forth battle between the open-source ad blocking community and its circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and that it’s possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much grief ad blockers have become for the industry.
Approximately 200 million people worldwide use ad-blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which is nearly four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is on the verge of blocking ads on pages that can be accessed on computers, as mobile blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesman said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider such an action worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preference” tool to give people more control over how ads target them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we’ve instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a motorway in Switzerland, apparently due to suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway early on Thursday in a case that appears to have been a suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the Vaud canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, calling on them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
That will be decided by the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases—both of which had a person walking in the dark on the highway—it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, the police were acquitted of allegations of homicide due to negligence after he was hit and killed by a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court said.
The court found that the police officer, who was responding to the emergency call, drove in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Once Had to Be Inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabited once.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and the atmospheric filling of carbon dioxide could sometimes have been earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s slow rate of rotation is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and still could have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas that were drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30% dimmed sun.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals that side of the day to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s current temperatures.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be inhabited at some time, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomenon - Venus, which we now know as Venus.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to quit Avalanche coach's job
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as Colorado Avalanche’s coach and vice president of ice hockey, claiming he had no influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the information and said the team would begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as Vice President of Ice Hockey Affairs and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
During the summer I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach’s and the Vice President of Hockey Affairs’ views must be fully aligned with the organisation’s views.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We value everything he has done for the organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League in his first season in the Avalanche 2013-14 season.
He led the team to 112 points and a mid-division victory, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to qualify in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the 2015-16 season ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to the Wild, losing the Western Conference wild card playoff position.
The Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks and postpone strike
The labor struggles of the North Sea oil workers for wages will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been randomly arranged on North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT federations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute," the statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh stand on the problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut its North Sea contractors’ fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in contractors in its country in 2014.
The company said further cuts would give the company the necessary leeway to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut its payroll to thousands of people and announced plans to quit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish MEP, Dave Anderson, met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes in a generation in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the country as a whole," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than <0x24>1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around <0x24>7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiadian star cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete list of star rotation speeds in the Pleiadian star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds and how orbital times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiade cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now on top level.
At their peak rotational speed, these mature stars displace large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sun spots.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, the bigger ones making the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiade cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation that embrace both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rotation and so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiades rotational speeds in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
