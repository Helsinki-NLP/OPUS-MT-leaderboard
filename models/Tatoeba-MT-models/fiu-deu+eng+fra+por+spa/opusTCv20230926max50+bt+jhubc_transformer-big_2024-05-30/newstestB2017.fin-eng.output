28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in Shopping Center in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at the Westfield shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Forensics Department.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said the death was a shock to them all.
"We are a small and tight team, like a family, and we miss it a lot," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in hostels, but that he had finally put things in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook food for all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the flow.
“Despite all the injustices that are happening in the world, he was a rough diamond that shone every day,” he says.
Anyone with any knowledge of the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors demand new labour force measures
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly responsible for specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and asked for permission to take new collective action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Commission (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is asking its entire government to support further labour-related measures from early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not resolved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members voted against the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chair of the Junior Medical Committee, tweeted a letter to JDC members in which she said the government “steadfastly silenced” the issues that led to her rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: “In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject the entire new treaty proposal and demands that all of our concerns be re-negotiated formally.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government to authorize progressively expanding industrial action from early September onwards.”
This year, junior doctors have been on strike six times, including the first complete shutdowns in the UK’s public health system.
BMA’s junior medical director Johann Malawana resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms that BMA had recommended.
Malawana told members of the BMA at meetings before the vote that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students participating in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the treaty would come into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands for reconciliation and formally end an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that there was a greater desire for reconciliation in Ankara.
The parties shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin, and there was hardly any warmth from him, even with his own reserved standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I myself did not keep up with the bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
Personally, I perceived his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin bluntly attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The offense was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain real trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media campaigned thoroughly and aggressively against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan’s own family had profited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the allegations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only to get Putin the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia may have won some sort of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after last month's nearly overthrow in a failed coup d'état.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motivation for reconciliation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey heavily, especially the ban on charter flights, as several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will surely sigh of relief when air traffic can finally be resumed.
They put their faith in the late-season rush into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall as Turkish agricultural products are allowed to import again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," the economic journal Vedemost wrote in an article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it thinks the West reacted subtly to the attempted coup.
Without forgetting the old resentment over the snail-moving negotiations for Turkey's EU membership and Putin's interference, Putin, who is keen to take advantage of the cool ties and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own obsessive concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey at their summit, in a gorgeous seaside booth, were able to convey what one analyst described as a "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a self-image as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It tells a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question about the differences between the two countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where to seek consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by Turkey, a member of NATO, when it shot down a Russian fighter plane, it is undoubtedly preferable that, after months of open hostility, the two Heads of State should at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS Bank, the Bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that in the future it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank was forced to retreat when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to put more national brands in the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not be abbreviated RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff presentation in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS is becoming an investment brand and what our staff are working for, because we are now becoming a much more diverse bank of brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Today, our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sponsoring the sport.
“This is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because basically it’s a question of how we can make the bank better for our customers,” said the bank’s president.
“Three years ago, it would have been very sarcastic if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But our work and focus on our customers’ needs rather than our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory at Newmarket and won his 3,000th prize.
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice in the same night on the track of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in smooth-track races.
He has previously been played by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are overwhelming because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night with an audience of 20,000 people.
I am relieved and I feel great humility.”
Dettori receives cheers with Prediclection after winning
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle racing, including champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-times champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of all time, and it’s no surprise that he reached this milestone, which few have ever reached.
She is elegant and strong, but her tactical prowess is what sets her apart.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, and his enthusiasm and pruning has brought fans to the sport for years.”
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn’t raced only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the UK has been victorious for almost 30 years, and it's been great to watch.
He’s a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he’s an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori aired his achievement in a distinctive way by jumping off his horse.
“From flying to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs along the way.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 in the "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and was banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had initial start-up difficulties, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his skeptics and returned to his best.
And he’s not going to end his career for a while yet – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career at least until he’s 50.”
Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov as Chief of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired Sergey Ivanov, his head of government.
Ivanov has been a trusted insider of Putin for several years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin “decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” but the reasons for his dismissal were not disclosed.
Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Chief of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the presidential protocol department and government office, according to the Russian-language website of the Kremlin.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: “I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means drafting legislation and monitoring how the instructions you give are implemented."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both sides said Ivanov would withdraw at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Is the dismissal the result of a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man hailed as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
On the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said to Putin: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complex and to some extent even tricky task for four years.
Now I have been the President’s head of administration for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin served as head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the task went to another of Putin’s close associates, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister and returned to office only three and a half years later.
'Criminal Minds' star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent shooting incident in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced their fires in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologised Thursday before his dismissal.
“We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be announced later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously starring in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
“I was hoping to see the series through to the end, but that’s no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important ones: the best fans the show could have ever hoped for.”
The twelfth season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banff Gardens
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been sucked into the ground by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seafront, published footage of the sight on the Periscope, hoping to get an answer to the emergence of these five-inch fish.
The Queensferry Bridge is now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing Bridge and the land bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "deck leafs" that are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 diagonal ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of State Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the countryside to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing Bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30 000 pieces of concrete and steel used to build this section alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, building a bridge section between the bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge cover is now almost 79% in place, and the rest of the cover is getting its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted in place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: “Completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urine pole in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the top in the field of civil engineering.
After the last part of the road deck had been installed and connected to the road deck of the North Tower, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e., terrestrial) gap.
This was done by pulling the north side of the land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and, at the same time, demanding high-precision operation.
Massive because the bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an angle of approximately 3%.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the working team had to follow were very low – just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department Reveals Three Men's Miracle Rescue
Three men who had been caught off Anglesey’s fishing boat were miraculously rescued.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station alerted Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew spotted an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat going right next to them and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, who drove Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the waters, luckily the strong winds had driven the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted, stuck in a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all taken to a rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men are still alive and in perfect health.
There was an emergency cord in the engine of the boat, but for some reason it had loosened from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky on their way.”
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get out of the couch and move.
Originally, only watching TV took screen time, then came video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor exercise are not mutually exclusive.
Pokémon Go is a game application with characters from a video game created in the 1990s (which later became a cartoon series, game cards, and other related products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this one stopped shortly before the new game was released in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to find Pokémon on their smartphones, tracked by GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (with a screenshot of the phone) or "captured".
The madness has swept the generation that played the video game younger and lifted their asses off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that an “average person” takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the launch of the game, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company does not know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it can only see raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get up from the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
People who move regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic things that support health – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disapproving spoilers.
And yes, someone can walk to the door while playing.
What's the deal?
A breakthrough has been made.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit could have tracked your activity before, they didn’t give you a reason to move on like Pokémon Go does.
The charm of novelty disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, with the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, increasing the physical activity and health of the people going on the hunt.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's multiplayer gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
With effortless boom.
Jaws squeezed with a permafrost.
Brilliant in everything.
Finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of silver "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform in the boom at the Women's Rack Gymnastics Individual Multiplayer Final on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
She became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman to win the multiplayer championship, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his overall final score appeared and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to a whole new dimension and puts him in the same category as other superstars of the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest stand gymnast of all time".
There was still one last race in Brazil, which took place first and foremost between Biles and himself and the burden of overexpectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring for less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States are hugging after winning gold and silver in the Women's Race Gymnastics Individual Multiplayer Final on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for the farewell party of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and is now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, this is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program – which includes a series of volts known as his trump card – has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
Adopted by her grandparents as a child and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother, Boorman has become a power figure. Boorman found the girl while she was on a daycare tour in the gym where Boorman was trained.
He has not lost a single multi-match race since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina reached the small lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a platform where Biles is the defensive world champion.
He regained the lead position after gaining 15,433 points from the boom and crowned the result with 15,933 points from the perm.
Raisman hugged him gently as they waited for the final points – which was a mere formality – and tears began to appear around the glittering red, white, and blue decor of Biles when his dream, once written in his clip book, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for the competition four years ago, when he first won third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-run.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team's "granny", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flying kisses to the public after his permanent program, thus emerging from a defeat position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, the widespread tweet this 19-year-old did earlier in the week now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three serial killers in car listening to music
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest massacre in ten years, while sitting in a car talking and listening to music while they were shot, police said Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Maleah Ellis' daughter were shot in a car parked on the street on June 12.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped in another car.
Police suspect the triple killing was not due to the robbery, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said police were investigating whether the killing was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks that occurred in predominantly Hispanic areas within four months.
"The events have something in common that they have happened in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told KPHO earlier this month, a subsidiary of CBS.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists are reluctant to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
Police also issued a statement that the shooting of an empty van was reported only half an hour before the triple killing, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found shells and recovered a bullet from the car seat and fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: “Things are getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a congenital microcephaly caused by a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, of which he was not aware when pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn’t make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any more of this practice,” says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund got up to sit down and started hitting the bus until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents a sign invented by Edmund, which means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to estimate how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I've been doing it all the time: what happens to us,
What will happen to us.”
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction in a while because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Severe rains and floods lead to massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rainfall and widespread flooding, with more rains expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi are flooding over their ridges and spreading across a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state's authorities were in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance was already on its way to the flooded areas.
According to Mike Steele, spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Response Bureau, the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tangipahoa County has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in force until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service, an additional 76-127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile region.
Over the weekend, Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are projected to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had risen higher than ever before at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among the rescued on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters away from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other son-in-law, who lived nearby, had warned her.
"We got up, and the water came with constant feeding," Hansford says.
"It reached to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford tells him that he and his family members are all injured and that he is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three large military-style trucks and taken them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of a report from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has been wetted heavily since the rains began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to heavy rains and flooding of streets, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council told CBS's subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County director Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been held captive by the flood.
Refugees have been opened for evacuees in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
“They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to draw back,” he says.
In Hammond, nearly twenty streets in Tangipahoa County had to be closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a major flood in March," said Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Council.
“This flood is similar.”
In Mississippi, it continued to rain evenly along the Gulf coast, according to Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy said a handful of flooded houses had been reported on Thursday, but no information had been received so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has been living in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before, and it rains more and more."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that his son was Mahaj Brown.
His grandparents said he had multiple gunshot wounds in his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was hit many times, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station.
"I can't believe this."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is expected to survive.
He was starting first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
One of the 29-year-olds was reported to be in critical condition and the other two were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men was the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossroads between several armed men.
The scene was full of assault gun-type shells, which came from various assault guns.
“It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the pavement.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting," Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department told a television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and it is reported that the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old victim of a shooting in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a misguided bullet while playing outside her home in West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I call the women’s gymnastics Olympic team, and there’s more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is amazing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as surprising and masterful rack gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win the gold medal in the Women's Individual Multiplayer.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but they are not the same in stand gymnastics classes nationwide.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed in the same footsteps as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the final five, as the next rack gymnastics Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly’s final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice mainly in private rack gymnastics clubs run by their parents. Parents pay training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas, which are able to support the activity.
The training of gymnasts takes place in these clubs and represents an expensive and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both been coaching sports enthusiasts since they started rack gymnastics.
We need to provide cheaper and more accessible stand gymnastics training for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have offered free or affordable stand gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we’re expanding to my hometown of Detroit to offer high-quality rack gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has aroused the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start exercising on racks, and that’s amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true “girlpower” you demonstrated when you won the Olympic gold medal and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to settle the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by agreeing to a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors who voted rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force a deal and said the UK’s public health system was “no one’s land” and that any further delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move on to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, made a statement last night, saying: "Junior physicians remain highly reserved about the proposed agreement, with particular concern that it will accelerate the current labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so we need to move forward now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even unresponsive to conversational attempts.
This is despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt promised last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial measures."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strikers in the strike watch.
The ministers hoped to bring the dispute over the changes to an end by renewing the agreement with the staff of the trade union representing British doctors.
Trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
NHS employee director Daniel Mortimer appealed to the junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer says: “Work-related measures achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already extreme teams and services and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the disclosure of malpractices.
Employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returnees from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of curricula, academic freedom and gender pay gaps in care – was a sign of the seriousness with which employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health wanted to stick to the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
Drugs that cost about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a drug that costs about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 per day, when authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer periods of use.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK’s public health system (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), now part of the UK’s public health system (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, one quarter of whom have a recurrence of a heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a fat deposit that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels and produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot to form, which prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is released, it can pass through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor should be given at 90 mg for the next 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg plus aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the NICE, says: “While effective treatments are available to effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke, often with fatal consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation of temporary use of ticagrelor adds treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited data available on efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, when used for more than three years, the Draft Guideline does not recommend the use of a longer treatment period.
Due to the climate of political correctness, voter fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, resulting in a government report
The climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes on widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticized the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to election fraud because of "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Pickles, former Minister of Regional Administration and current anti-corruption figure, intimidating voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity document in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voters only have to give their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be dipped in ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be more protected, says Sir Eric.
He demands that journalists’ access to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and a culture of favour in local governments more broadly," he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the Tower Hamlet polling scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman had “irreligiously distorted” the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to have “based his campaign on the religious obligation of every Muslim to vote for him.”
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or given fraudulently by a person who voted by pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the post-election fraud in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several suggestions to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: 'There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in communities with a Pakistan and Bangladesh background'.
"There was concern that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such actions because of the 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots to prevent “votes from being harvested.”
Theresa May's report under review also calls for stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
Soak your fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition for political activists to process filled-in postal voices and postal voice envelopes.
The police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to bring intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Only allow English in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthening training to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person may enter the polling booth at a time.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without any serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded for many reasons."
He also criticised the ineffective 'rabbing checks' of the municipal offices responsible for electoral rolls.
"The ruling of the Court last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and disguised fraud and denial of elections by some."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgängers in Rio at the Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only championship-fighting athlete with a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the U.S. men’s archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duchess Catherine’s double on the cycling tracks, many people have cited on social media how one archer could be the twin brother of actress Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, the men’s archery team in the United States, caused a storm after tweeting pictures of him reminiscent of the star of the Wolf of Wall Street film.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that he had heard from a child that he was reminiscent of DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the resemblance as great, perhaps except for the beard and the moustache," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the 2012 London Games, the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were haunted by their resemblance, which will undoubtedly be highlighted even more in these games.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor in the movie Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, highlighted by their strong eyebrows and lips, has long been cited.
Swimming silver medalist Yulia Efimova of Russia resembles actress Annalynne McCord, not just for her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while Nathan Adrian of the US team is, according to his fans, an "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
The two iron women, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter-series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in the shape of their faces and eyes.
Not only that: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the pair to look similar.
One tweeter recently expressed his delight that "others on the Internet agree on the resemblance of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American football star and the Dexter-series actor are really strikingly similar in the shape of their faces and eyes.
Many people have also noticed the resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union, the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna Go! star.
CBC’s Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer “dead as a pig”
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4th place in a women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message shocked CBC's direct Olympic record viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian public broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “lost smelling” and “dead as a pig” during the race.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 m freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC narrative team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese dick of yours, baby.
He was too excited, he left in a hurry, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at 1:57.79 in the second part of the message, remaining 1.61 seconds behind the Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to swim in China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly, shocked by the commentator’s tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who slept in the final of the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message, was described as "This little 14-year-old Chinese dick of yours, baby.
Byron MacDonald's criticism of Twitter was quickly overwhelmed with criticism, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis tweeted: "Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and you're making us all sound like a group of racists.
Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologised for MacDonald's speech: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell has been asked to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued his apologies to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald’s speeches.
The television company also issued a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they got on the air.
We promptly apologized to our viewers and apologised to our social media followers.
For the record, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
On Thursday evening, MacDonald expressed his apologies on the broadcast and tried to justify his speech by saying he did not mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message bathing," MacDonald told CBC.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean anything demeaning with my words, and I’m very sorry.”
A woman in Primark in the middle of a store wore her underwear to shock customers
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of the Primark to fit her underwear.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, took them off his legs and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to twist and eventually tried out four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
A Primark chain store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried her underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, said that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman wore clothes and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear from the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but he did it completely shamelessly.
Everyone stared as he took off the underwear he had tested, and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding not to like them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the look – and he didn’t think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old who lives in Kenttown, continues: “How disgusting it is to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has worn and not washed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the store staff tried to remove those items from the sale after the woman left – which is right.
It would be awful to take your new underwear home and find out that someone else has tried them without washing them afterwards," Davidson adds.
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market.”
How to Defend Yourself from Armed Attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga League in New York City and asked for advice on how to cope with a gun-swinging robber or assaulter in close proximity.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your forearm and shoulder, and hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee to the groin, and as he passes through the pain twice, slap him in the face with a gun barrel and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches from the front. You must move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker with your fist into the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound tricky?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Keep in mind, however, that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash – unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
World Traveler Ian Wright licks the Dirtiest Places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and reflexes to the test by licking the dirtiest and most repugnant places in Europe.
Suffolk presenter and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking a euro banknote, a handrail in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button in a train toilet, and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was documented in the documentary Ian Wright – On the Trace of Inner Power, and the results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet flush button on a train can be disgusting, but in fact, there are more germs in the kitchen sink.
While traveling across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening the good bacteria in the gut and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a nasty mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, in which he tested his intestinal endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and miraculous things.
The licking of railway station handrails and toilet flush buttons undoubtedly challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "Ever since I was a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health and put stuff in my mouth, like dirt, worms, and slag."
In the movie, he proved to be worthy of his reputation.
The border was met only in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units from the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The limit was met in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units – the same number for newly washed hands is less than 60.
In the documentary Ian Wright – On the Trail of Inner Power, Wright works with Valio to make the number of bacteria visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don’t lick anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – On the Trace of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, helps to strengthen good bacterial strains and resistance in the gut.
Valio’s category manager for snacks, juices and novelty products, Niko Vuorenmaa, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ia to join us.”
Bowel health has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of bowel health, and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let’s say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to lick some objects, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on the tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents linked lactic acid bacteria especially to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they used products to which lactic acid bacteria were added at least occasionally.
A family of harassers destroyed a town-owned apartment building in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted
The disturber family left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to the city-owned rental house after being evicted for terrorizing the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the rental housing company’s representatives said that the apartment was in repair condition.
There were gaps in the walls, floorboards were ripped off, debris was spread on the floors, and the walls were stamped with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment could no longer be saved.
He says, “This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to become known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as its name suggests.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family’s tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and transmission, and loud screams, quarrels, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an anti-social order.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under threat of demolition.
Drugs had previously been sold in the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
According to neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Department forced the couple out this week after giving them 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We’ve been living next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here unbelievably many times.”
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we are not used to it!
It’s going to be wonderful now that they’ve finally been evicted.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing Office, said the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called on a regular basis.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the apartment building.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and that of his or her family, since eviction is always the last measure Cornwall housing agency is considering.
This case was very difficult because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood to watch.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members, who took part in the work and courageously offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick says the family's three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Housing workers now have to clean out the waste heaps surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been found guilty of possession of Class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the tombstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been told that they have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they are calling for eviction of tenants who violate the lease rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction acted as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they want without prosecution, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," Crow said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying Army Jet Frightens Tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force has plunged to a staggering low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes close to touching the sandy beach of sunbathing tourists in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers got on their feet with understandable concern about the thunder of the jet engines that began to be heard before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who photographed the dramatic bypass and posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would crash on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at an astonishingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant the plane had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke from nearby forest fires interfered with visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Eksote's first half-year result better than expected
In January-June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) achieved a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned.
Eksote’s result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the demolition of institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for action.
The exote covers a previously created deficit with a surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten queues and purchase procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Rangers swore an oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took an oath on Friday.
The military ballot of the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Limit Jäger Course was held at the garrison’s sports field.
70 conscripts took the oath.
Special border ice skaters are trained for demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border guard.
250 of them were invited to the test.
Special boundary ice skaters have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the Frontier Forces during the war participated in the meeting organised in connection with the election ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A bit ahead of the robber - Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had a RTA unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a sergeant stationed in the bay.
Chief of Staff is a Lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilian uniforms.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity,” says Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The creation of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would rarely leave the place of the whistles until they received the alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established, with fewer than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Crime Police in Vantaa, manages the operations nationwide.
As its name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided according to police departments and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiry extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because crime does the same.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar offences through registers, an alert mission database and observations.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools.
Everyone has their own way of working.
The handprint can also be seen in work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the manner in which it is done, the person creates a certain image.
The serialization can be done on the basis of either the method or the person, depending on which police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars upright, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no information on the methods used, either by the criminals themselves or by the criminals themselves, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police attempts to prevent crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the method of marking empty dwellings, reported in early summer, used in house break-ins.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin, or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material shall be public, at least for interested parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest ones will order a report from the district court, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found on the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen of Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola of Eastern Finland Police, Inspector Sami Joutjärv of Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela of the Central Criminal Police have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against the background of a decrease in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage reform of PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
Through national cooperation, information is collected outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
London Schoolgirl Joined by ISIS Killed in Syria
According to the news, one in three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl’s family had heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, was just planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this serves as a warning example and a testament so that people realize that this is a real risk when they go to a war zone - and that will dissuade people from deciding to leave," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other schoolgirls from East London, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had become a widow just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have refused to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect the person to fill the post of the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a teleconference on Thursday, Reid said he predicted Clinton would elect Garland “with a fairly high degree of certainty.”
A Reid spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team wouldn’t want to “swing the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Columbia County.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland’s nomination were Donald Trump’s “commanders” and “adjutants.”
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats, naked calendars belong to both men and women.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s style calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli.
Instead of celebrity secrecy models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, said earlier this year that his nudity-inspiring magazine differs from old-school Playboy magazines, saying, “Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these lady-bodied images without the hassle,” Shaw said in a press release.
"Women are sure to want to participate in this project, because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who want to be a model for the calendar can upload their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: who buys the records?
Lonely middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection in the comment section under the nickname NoAllLonelyMedium-agedMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to research company YouGov, behind the much-discussed re-establishment of vinyl records is not the millennial-generation boom, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but the background is middle-aged nostalgia.
The age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It’s also not just the hobbyists’ desire to collect records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl record buyers are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a television newscast, the camera would follow me as I walk down the bustling Soho Street, wearing a jewelry-free gray jacket. I would vibrate, bend my arms into a cup, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and ruggedness as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have occupied formerly privately owned spaces, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I look very close to the men visiting these stores and try to assess their age and character by observing.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-something woman) is on a meeting trip to London during the afternoon and spends his spare time exploring the shops.
I asked if he was a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill the walls of his living room, as you can see from the picture. (Stuart sent the picture to me by e-mail, I didn’t follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly due to his available income. He is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they first appeared, and re-purchase things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11, or 12, and probably too young to have them," she says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their company, and adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice."
Wez, 25, from Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow that has been affected by the media hype. These people have heard about the vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"Based on my conversations, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyls back,” he says.
This may explain the boom of vinyl worms of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you realize that they provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may confuse some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means perseverance and reminds of the happy days of youth.
“I think sometimes it fills a gap or material possessions are acquired for some kind of comfort,” says Wez.
“I see it as a collector myself, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get your mind off of it.”
"We're like social workers!" cries Wez's co-worker from behind the stack of discs.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album last month had not listened to it yet.
The poll also found that 41% of record buyers have a turntable that they never use, and 7% of vinyl buyers do not have their own turntable at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while doing a stack of bossa nova collections.
The return of vinyl records is also accompanied by a "pokal phenomenon" that Jonny, 42, who sells Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men at the time) has discovered.
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
“The number of such customers is not high, but they are.
Materiality is more important to them than music.
Some of our clients tell us they don't have a turntable yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just starting a hobby.”
The customer base is much more diverse in Foppi, which I will visit next. The store has dedicated a whole layer of vinyl records.
Guests include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Customers are delighted with the variety, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: instead of the jazz buzzing from the speakers, Wild Beasts’ latest sex-inspiring synthesizer pop.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to tell a bite-out psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fop for a few minutes and watched various discs at a discount.
He's more of a watcher than a shopper.
He says his income is low, so it is not possible for him to collect the records.
"They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from the computer or otherwise, but the subtlety of the wine is ...", she lets go of a fond sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they're jumping in jeans shorts, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and a daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the central records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just a decorative element and part so high that you can’t even reach them.
They are made of pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that any way to get attention to these records could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population group most likely to have more time and money than most people is also the group that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl discs.
While my research shows that YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely tied to school or work.
Surely they will not spend their Thursday mornings chessing at Berwick Street record stores, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old television host staring terribly and gazing at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate – video report
Scientists say the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest ice shark ranged from 272 to 512 years.
French court dismisses request for closure of jungle camp
A French court has rejected a request from the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
At the trial this week, the authorities in Calais made claims that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp, which sell different kinds of goods to the residents of the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, and offer haircuts. You can buy tea at temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the prefectural authorities of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy, and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Prefect of Calais "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants in the camp had a much greater significance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
They provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids café, a non-profit café that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, who are in the most vulnerable position.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling for a children’s cafe to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, closing it “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate Friday that since the steep increase in summer arrivals, the jungle camp's population has reached a record high of over 9,000.
Food prices in Finland are declining much faster than the EU average
Food is becoming cheaper in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the displeasure of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries the price of food on average fell by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen the second most in those EU countries that have similar wage levels as in Finland.
Only in the UK has food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on a post by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published in Tieto & Trendit -blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turnaround, after which the food became cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed down by Russian food import bans, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Tightened price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in the EU countries with similar wage levels as in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU level in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the EU average and continue to compete in prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
If you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan sets out the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, the teaching of craftsmanship is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies begin at the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of the students.
It was once thought that the teacher would teach the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It could live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is bypassed only by the Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to monitoring, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon timing.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-cm tall Amazonian fish, were discovered to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks reach sexual maturity only at ages over four meters, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired almost 300 salespeople
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be cut, most of them in the form of redundancies,” Stockmann said in a statement.
It states that the number of store vendors will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of the support functions will be offered a new job as sellers.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations involved about 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need for reductions was estimated at about 380 employees.
The population reduction aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store business continues to suffer losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Vice President and CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second-quarter performance improvement was mainly driven by Lindex’s good success.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, at the same time, the Stockmann Group as a whole had a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, HS meteorologist.
There will also be rainstorms in the central part of the country, but there will be rainstorms in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In rainy areas in the north it is 10-15 degrees Celsius.
Kenya’s Athletics Team Shocked by Doping Scandal – Curious Explanation for Coach’s Rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete for a doping test.
According to the AP, the athlete that Anzrah was trying to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, Kenya’s national team leader, said Anzrah’s identity had been revealed after giving a surprise test sample as Rotich.
Doping officials came to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he “committed a crime against the Kenyan national team.”
He acted as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour,” Kip Keino, the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right away.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth on the way to the World Cup last year and is one of Rio’s favorite winners.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah travelled with an athlete’s accreditation card just to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium 's
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, watching athletics.
The athletics medals contest started in Rio on Friday, but the world’s top figures were allowed to show off their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio’s organisers said on Friday that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets had been sold.
The second one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was cheering with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, rugby, canoeing and horseback riding have seen thousands of empty benches.
When Brazilian medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, they were only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian doubles, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12,000-strong team was only 30 percent full.
At least the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from reaching European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football, explains the bad sales.
However, even the Brazilian football team’s first match failed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, a figure that is much lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, despite the fact that tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have varied from around 9 euros to over 1000 euros during the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have issued 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
In the morning, the stadium was filled with empty seats.
Even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Get the Right to Land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
Individuals, companies and entities can then use money to redeem titles to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder gets a veto on the 187-square-square-square plot, which in practice means that not every holder needs approval if the land is to be changed for a different purpose.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring ownership is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of ownership for his company.
The person who has acquired the management right receives precise location data from the block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The names of the holders of rights are displayed on the Foundation’s website on the same map where the land block data can be found.
Leviäkangas sees as a risk of its nature conservation acquisition only that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is based on the idea of protecting natural areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation purchases land either by buying or by donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of titles, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the most in big cities - see the situation in your home town
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the most in Finland’s major cities.
There have been more bikes stolen this year than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat found out, on the basis of bike theft reported to the police, how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
There's a big difference.
"There are twice as many robberies in some cities in proportion to the population compared to others," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector at the Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the list.
It is very difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much people are riding on wheels and how many wheels there are in the city," says Sergeant Teemu Äikkäs.
The Finnish Police Board Tommi Reen expects that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts largely depends on what the study and cycling cities are.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where the city centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In all of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bike thefts reported to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts every year.
This means 50-60 fillers per day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes per year.
"It's a lot," Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report of bicycle theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police is reported.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be found during other investigations, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bicycles can be found in an apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with the crime itself or a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks in shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically anywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoi is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but many of the stolen bikes end up on the internet, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that there are very few stolen bicycles going abroad," Reen said.
Purchasers of stolen bicycles are ordinary Finns, according to the police.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a second-hand bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of concealment offences or concealment offences.
"The alarm bells should ring if a fit bike is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Special library official Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki every working day.
He has had five bikes, but none of them have been stolen," says Elk. "Never stolen, so a good monk has gone."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, it doesn't necessarily have a hipster value," says Elk from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was busy at a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now, the bike was pushing the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike in something fixed, like a bike rack.
"You have to think a lot about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"You hear from my friends all the time that the bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, such bad-ass jockeys."
A bicycle was stolen from the building a year ago.
The bike had not been locked, so Valve was expecting it to be stolen.
Under 15 years of age for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with US-famous peer-to-peer squads
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer sworn-in team is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The jury intervenes in the first offense committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator may join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other models of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everything is directed in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t go wrong from the first mistake,” says Laitio.
The peer-to-peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person after his first crime does not face an adult panel, but rather reflects on what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu service design agency who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first offences committed by children under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of Migrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want the Party to Stop Financing Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a draft to see it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to go to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking impopularity, threaten to bring Democrats to the polls in this election,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing every day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
Weinstein said the letter came from “people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress” and that it was not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will go well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handout to American labourers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the builders, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
“If a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the tax,” Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published in the Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "favoring only this kind of millionaire."
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cut, Clinton has previously called Trump “a loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded the audience of the small businessmen whose bills Trump has not paid and of the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are the audience figures of Rio: The Games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewer statistics.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a huge audience.
At one time, the Games have glued at best 12 per cent of the population to the screens: 615 000 viewers watched the Tuesday night swimming on Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Championships in athletics one month ago attracted nearly 800,000 spectators at a time and the European Championships in football attracted well over a million.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been cycling on Sunday night and rack gymnastics on the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle Panu Pokkinen, the head of sports, is pleased with the number of spectators and recalls that for the first time at the Olympic Games in Rio, the spectators are divided into several instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the percentage of television viewers who choose the Olympic Games at all.
On the TV side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When it comes to 24 hours a day, with between 20,000 and 500,000 viewers throughout, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s competition broadcasts will be in Finland at night.
Another reason for the diluted interest - if someone now considers it diluted - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is only just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of spectators has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, spectators explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the Apple App Store during the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're already at 200,000 downloads.
"We'll get our online audience figures later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been provided, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio are visible on Yle channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious to Yle ever, but also the last to be watched only on Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be visible on both Upper and Commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a 20 square meter depression in Ristikele, the bottom of which was a diving computer with a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to strengthen the observation by sonar.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess at 100 metres,” says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend over 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sunset.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been thoroughly mapped.
"There could well be unfamiliar depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, Päijänne cannot reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Repair 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: The last paragraph where the deepest lakes of medium depth were wrong was corrected.
Ihalainen: Taxation of pensioners continues to be tightened
Taxation of pensioners is higher than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came to light during the parliamentary elections and pensioners’ taxation was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income cuts that reduced taxation.
The matter warmed the representatives of the opposition in Parliament, who shredded the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb’s election promises.
Buying power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy on tax cuts presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about securing, not increasing, purchasing power, as next year salaries will not be increased.
He says tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is satisfied with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Orpo about their willingness to respect the competitiveness pact, which has been difficult to achieve.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be questioned.
It becomes necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own faith in the future.
Tackling prolonged unemployment in the barn
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget debate, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed in June was approximately 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
If growth does not stop, he says, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The travel season for Finns in Thailand starts at year-end.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy in Thailand has received some comments from Finns on Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out specifically to the Finns in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes the events may be linked to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, there were arrests of people who expressed opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
Previously, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
The city celebrates the Queen’s Birthday and Mother’s Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks would affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police say, according to the AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the last 24 hours as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded last night on holiday island Phuket, a tourist destination popular among Finns, reports the Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist resort of Hua Hin, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military junta, said the attacker had not yet been identified.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
"We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy tourism in the country because all the attacks took place in tourist areas.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the instructions of the Embassy on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims.
We've had a little bit more information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower.
Thai PBS said police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Thani’s bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
According to CNN, two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Thani, which exploded about half an hour apart.
The Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quads
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for rack championships at the Rio Games on the platform, jumping and boom.
Biles has mastered women's gymnastics to a degree in recent years.
He won eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and perm championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the previous year.
In the United States, Biles has won two team world championships.
Weaker World Cup medals at Biles are from jumping and booms.
Thai entrepreneur: “Isku has no impact on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children’s playground on the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more strikes, I don’t think there will be anything more surprising,” estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year the bombing in Bangkok.
If this has not been the case before, then this is not the case either.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. local time and said that it was not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought that the roadblocks had been set because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach had never heard of the attacks.
About half past three o’clock in the afternoon, the traffic in Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
The car was later seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men fit for identification, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately arrested.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thanked those who gave the hints.
Head of Research on Russian Leadership Changes: Clear Displacement
On Friday, the most prominent change of leadership in Russia took place in years, when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is Anton Vaino, a 44-year-old Estonian-born.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that recycling managerial positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov may have been in trouble with other leaders or have made a mistake.
Ivanov's defeat
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
In a tape released by the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace Persecution, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President’s Security Council.
During the Soviet era, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was elected president by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that the more interesting thing than the heir to Ivanov’s place is that Putin changes his close circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters use civilians as human shield when withdrawing from Syria
“They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of Manbij, an Islamic State city.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Correction of previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, civilians were abducted by ISIS fighters while they were fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but it is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Communications Director of the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Final Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time during the high-value races.
He broke his thighs early in the season and was forced to skip the Olympic Qualifiers in Jamaica.
This hasn’t been a perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
"I've practiced well and that's the key thing," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Porina around Bolt underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he was eliminated in the 200 m first round in 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young pledge slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, where he broke the world record and the self-confidence of his competitors in a time of 9.69 in spite of the final celebration.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career.
The Berlin world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200m world record and a 19-second record, but nobody but Bolt himself believes it will be.
Bolt’s biggest challenge is Athens’ 2004 Olympic 100-time winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the high-level finals, if only he could make it.
In Daegu, Bolt missed the <0x24>100 World Cup final in 2011 because of a deceitful departure.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set the final finish line of his career for next year’s World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older and it's harder.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,” Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of prohibited substances in a doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in the women's 100 m butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case before the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said that Xinyi's sample on Sunday showed evidence of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping allegations have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekov has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya has sent a trainer home for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during a test and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich's 800-meter race pass.
Nothing can stop Phelps - historical gold came to show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims in the 200 metres in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic gold medal in the same sport in the fourth consecutive Olympics.
Phelps won 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in mixed swimming before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs in Iltalehti's quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next up is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t stress much if there’s a little noise in the social media or in the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
“Television is a visual media,” he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a shorter dress that certainly has at least enough revealingness - at least to the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, there are no back steps.
It’s important to look good, and small courts are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure to want to cheer you up and maybe even cheer you up, but he insists he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the storm has reached all the way to Finland?
I can’t, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me.
You know what, man?
It’s a buzz out of nowhere if it comes from (the host’s) dressing up.
I'm a little amused if something like this hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said on Thursday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The arrests were made by the police in connection with the security controls.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that police arrested in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees allegedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence were circulated, among others, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
Police blew up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police allowed the public in after they controlledly blew up the package.
This is the third time in the history of the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not get to the stand by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and allowed the public to enter the hall only afterwards.
The drink woke up the Spanish team, which started the race sleepily.
With two defeats, Spain defeated Nigeria with 96 to 87 points.
In the last two races, Spain won the silver medal.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious finding near the road cycling finish line last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria have started their match in front of empty stands in the first round of the Rio Basketball tournament.
Argentine lady shoved Petäjä-Siren - Finnish protester
Tuuli Petäjä-Sireni had a colourful day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a hard time on Thursday.
The Argentine lady kicked Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He was stuck in a car crash and the others ran away, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete had long been protesting.
It was not worth it, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish driver was placed 27th in the race.
The 2012 London Olympic silver medallist is the eighth.
When it comes to the tip, the collision didn't really work.
Friday is an important day when we have to race 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Strange Things That Science Says Will Prolong Life
Science has explored everything between heaven and earth.
These things have been proven to add years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health in a way that prolongs his or her life.
Sometimes, things that a person can’t control can add years to his life.
These include a tendency to be obese or a social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don’t always have to go for it – just getting a can of milk is enough.
The secret of long life has been investigated by various studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all of these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially in the case of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption of one to three daily doses of alcohol may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine-drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of floss can prolong a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the onset of other diseases in other parts of the body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
When protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, many studies show that sex is good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
It will take more years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute slackness.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it’s an Olympic medal-winning athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some scientists suspect that longevity is due to a person’s social status – which, in turn, makes it possible to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 found that a person who shops on a daily basis was more likely to be less likely to be a parent than the one who shops.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to premature death.
Put your credit card down – online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver crashed into a truck.
On Friday evening, a serious cam collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koski, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koski, in the middle of Koskikent and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the car that met him had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained on its lane after the collision, but burned.
The driver was able to extinguish the fire himself.
The car slipped into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman, born in 1972, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of driving intoxicated.
Post sent candy to the wrong city.
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candy, as the post had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught my eye.
Unfortunately, there are product shortcomings in loose cakes, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti delivers the load!
Unless there was traffic in the lawn mowing, the sign said.
The merchant’s flipping sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The lawn cut is on Posti’s offer until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly funny and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the attention generated by this issue is unbelievable, Halt wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his favourites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti Enterprises Transport Services, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The reason is that three of the five stages got lost in the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we didn’t go to Salo with three more stages, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported by Evening-Say.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign, because she found all her loose candy favourites in the selection.
30 pounds lighter Lotta Backlund published a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has lost tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a photo of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and she was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project already in 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and has slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a photo of her performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After picture pair has collected several praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We’re on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, as I travel the same way, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last kilos with the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach normal weight, which was 10 kilograms away at the time.
During the three-month exercise course, the pounds eventually fell to five.
Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembrance of the victim for the police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations to police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed a nursing training there.
Veterinarians remember the woman with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor and fearless of work.
A good friend.
We still can't fully comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The suspect, a 27-year-old man, did not know the woman and did not have any connection with her.
The killer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
Börje survived and is recovering.
District court sentences Posti for violation of equality law
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court judged in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the detained salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only the part of the orientation counsellor’s salary that corresponded to the part of the orientation counsellor’s full-day work.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the organisational decision of the Postal and Logistics Industry Union PAU on the introduction ban.
During last November’s postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees will not introduce temporary agency workers who break the strike.
This was first reported in the People’s News.
Turkey returns to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Centre) in their reply to the Association of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the association asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for the freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression in Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration – replaced by Estonian-origin Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, will replace him.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin’s statement, Ivanov, one of Putin’s close insiders, will take on special tasks in the fields of environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace Persecution, Russia Today said.
Ivanov co-operated with Putin in the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Ivanov was considered by many to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was succeeded by Dmitry Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's Giant Purchase Banned - Not Seen at Premier League Opening
The world record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from England.
Manchester United's outright acquisition of Paul Pogba has been suspended from ManU's opening of the league against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said Friday.
ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million to Juventus, according to British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game because Pogba was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-match ban.
The ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play will be in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, greatness is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions for entertainment have established Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event, starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festival goers have typically expressed themselves in their distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival is styled with artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
Behind the success lies a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in the production of events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 by 70,000 last year.
This year, the festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle steered by huge avenues.
We don't want that.
For 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area, partly decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year the venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that even large visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, in the middle of the 2000s, the activities depended heavily on the support of the City of Helsinki of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, Flow’s limited liability company’s turnover was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "greek things," such as the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in their distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
First and foremost, we want to stand out in content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of the punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival, which combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was bukkake, because this is probably the last time we will see this at a gig in Finland.
We care about everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been making damn good gigs over the last few years.
Bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
Two local time bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted an extensive picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two local time bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon afterwards, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also favored by the Finns.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, the bombings are likely to be carried out by insurgents who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have been keenly engaged in the activities of criminal organizations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are only ordered to fight until several months after they have taken the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Head of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible for combat in a war situation.
According to the Head of Training, the first reservists to be assigned are those in the standby force.
No conscript or reservist will be ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier this summer it appeared that the Finnish Defence Forces will begin training conscripts for immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, the units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation for homestay
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused harmful microbial flora.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to 132,000 euros, which resulted in financial losses for Tola and Waroma of as much as 198,000 euros.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the District Court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47,344 for the couple’s legal and settlement costs.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because some of the need for repair had already been known to the buyers at the time of the purchase.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors in the construction were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
She was looking for a good home.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a fit home because they did not want to take up repair work.
He had the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that the issues mentioned in the health inspection report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and inconveniences of ventilation and the inadequate control of rainwater and melting waters spilling along the rock surface.
However, it was not clear from the discussions that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that the rainwater coming from the cliffs should be managed a little bit within a few years.
The transaction took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which according to witnesses was caused by both the rock’s rainwater and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could also enter indoors through the porch, according to the inspector.
Health-risk-enhancing mold or yeast that exceeded the limit values was found in the scrubbing samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the living room window erker and the basement washroom.
Terraces built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that before the sale, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home issues were a central issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major renovations in the near future.
Tola and Waroma were of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that there was no special reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Scary archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finnish women in the register
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives in Maryland, USA, has microfilmed records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
Documents and registration cards are from the National Race Office in Nazi Germany.
The Breed Office was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women who had to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were undergoing gynecological examinations to find out.
The racial agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by examining church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the family tree of women.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed office handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The breed office wanted guarantees that the women were “child-loving,” “spareful,” and “good National Socialists” who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program stipulated, among other things, that every SS man should have four children, whether in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographics focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between “Aryans” and “non-Aryans” were prohibited by law, the museum’s website says.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, the nerd rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third at the first departure of Finnjollie’s day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained at the top of the team’s tail on the second departure of the day.
He was eighth overall after five runs, but failed in the second run to drop him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures in 17th and 3rd place.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were 23rd in the day’s opening.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Tale was recorded with a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so stubborn"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish artists’ favourites for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää continues to play and is currently in a fierce state of affairs.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Nude, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgenpää’s career rose to full cheer when he won the crown of the tango king at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so stiff!
The bridge in the book.
The recording of a song that became a huge hit would not immediately suggest that it was sung with a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, it was still a good impression.
I learned that you don’t have to be perfect and perfect all the time.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then-partner and the case ended up in the lyrics of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmäinen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making an album that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, it was based on the news in the 7 Days magazine.
In the newspaper news, the reason for Jari’s separation from his ex-lover was said to be excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was bullshit and not true.
According to the book, Jari was furious when he called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually he ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of voters were in favour of the split and 48 per cent would have stayed in the Union, even though polling during the week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged in favour of the divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” flew into the rubbish bin in Britain’s Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked that the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professional answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists’ loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the real British.
Many people also believe that a decline in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it will boost the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly affected by the BBC’s fairness, which gave just as much room for EU-backed economists representing only a few percent of the economist population as for the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic combinations think about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom voters, in their opinion, have no common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming win-win argument in the Brexit vote was immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant congests your hospital, the immigrant exploits you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign employees in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a British doctor if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that due to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues for health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
In Aberdeen, he said, Brexit was prepared in a timely manner by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the EU-pro-exit camp, began to be more prepared a few weeks before the vote, in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we held 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open-to-listed real estate fund on a daily basis that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest rate in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds have closed trade.
When the EU-backed camp won, Europe got confused.
However, the few weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freezed its trades.
Together, they rallied the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position due to the cash raised, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trades for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling the money out in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you do not have to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and the majority withdrew the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite even, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar upheaval in Aberdeen's Continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closure of real estate funds’ trading operations received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about four per cent of UK real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties in its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds to the end of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been pushed downwards, but the situation does not seem to be "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit hits the property market in London
At two o’clock in the morning, things didn’t look so good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word you got.
I realized that this is going to be on the side of plan B," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was still alive in the morning.
TV screens, normally silenced in the office, swirled the news, and usually loud crowds were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened up, the displays flashed all red.
It was a morning you never thought you would be alive, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins with corrections
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the real estate market in the UK and especially in London.
London offices were expected to have up to 20% minuses in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after the other.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the thunderstorm has subsided, but uncertainty is still raging in the air.
It does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will occur and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first reported.
CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London office buildings accounted for 6.1 per cent of the minus, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the similar drops occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared to the collapse of Lehman and the global financial crisis that began in the US real estate market.
In Vanhanen's view, the comparison is not entirely appropriate, as this is the UK's domestic crisis.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has not seen such panic sales at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is found normally.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, a price correction is no wonder to him - it could have been without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started very high.
London prices have risen for four reasons, Vanhanen says.
The British economy has grown strongly, and the population of London has also grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will globalize, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for income in new destinations.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, leverage has now been used much less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was a turnaround, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the UK economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but he says that there is hardly any prospect of an upward spike.
The mood indicates that there is a descending or steady course ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that work can make it out of the pit.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of a victim.
If it has been decentralized, then the risks have been decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S-Group begins to register shopping information more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you’re eating, as the merchant group announced today that it will start collecting even more detailed information about its regular customers’ purchases.
Up to now, when information has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it from the purchased products as well in early May.
S-Group follows Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has already been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and is used for marketing purposes subject to consent.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, says Riitala to Talousanoim.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in S-Group registration.
Kesko categorizes its regular customers in ten groups according to their grocery purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is currently planned.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Loyalty Program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect information on product or product group levels, we remain at the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know which store the purchases were made in and on which day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K Group or S Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is planned to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise to start the registration of product information.
Initially experimenting
So far, SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and addresses, the basic data also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the location, the total amount of purchases and the payment method are stored.
In addition, the data of the S-bonus partners are derived from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodi’s Terroi and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time now, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs’ newest dog reinforcement – the puppy becomes the first dog to detect explosives
The black labrador’s puppy sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It will not be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of fragrant casings of powdered gas was discovered.
Powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now,” says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the exploration of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main place of work in Heila, as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels triggered measures in Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened," said Finnish Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for training an arms and explosives detection dog in Customs’ tasks is postal consignments that pass through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, from online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and postal items.
In the future, it will be of great benefit in ports, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive detection dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila also attend training sessions with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs decides together with other authorities what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include keenness and hunting, as well as serenity, because the dog has to deal with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t get anywhere at home without him, he laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from a one-time lake.
The cameraman loses the camera mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the mic cover that looks like a soft toy immediately from the "untie" command.
Strong competition for working dogs
Heilan’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still exams ahead, next in October, in which it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
You can see Heilan at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio recalls.
The cost of one working dog for Customs is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire under the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dogs are the owners of hard competition in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
The lucky spot was Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but she has years of experience with dogs and controlling tasks at Customs.
Mini-State Receives First Olympic Medal – People Get a Day Off
With less than a million people, Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
Fiji's government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The rugby team of Fiji celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital, Suva, where a screen had been set up at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," said Maikele Seru, a reporter for the Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer faints after a fierce performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at a weight loss of 175 kg after a tough fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During, or immediately after, he has fainted several times.
No one really could say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilograms for pushing and 145 kilograms for sweeping.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to push 175 kilos in the final, as well as the second one.
In the third attempt, the weights were raised, accompanied by fierce roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Itta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men’s football league, has signed a long-term contract with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player with strengths and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players-agents.
Slowly Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS came in need of a new striker when last season's country king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
'Modern Family' star shrugged again: teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as Alex Dunphy in the modern Family comedy series, is once again showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don’t leave much to your imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has been posing in pictures published on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very scarce outfits.
On the eve of adulthood, Winter has recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for most of his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood receives, Palmer says, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has infuriated some of his long-time fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so strong,” a woman said on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look gorgeous!
I don't care what the others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fabulous mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main destinations of Northern Lights tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump card of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season begins early in autumn and continues far into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight two times more fairy-tale, says Anne Lind, Visit Finland’s chief marketing officer.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35 year olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by, for example, online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more distinct and unique sights from Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights has tremendous potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have increased in Finland much more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's champion team won gold
Britain’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was devastatingly interrupted when Fiji won the final at Rio’s Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, with numbers 43–7.
Fiji taught the champions in ball handling, moves, side delusions, support games, running lines, and brutal power, winning gold – if it was the country’s first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat meant silver, which was a bit of a greater consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day, and they can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby 7 tournament, in which the team defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win over the South African Boxes in the 7–5 semifinals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have defeated the British, even if the 15-member team had been in full force.
Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby 7 coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's coaching at the Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Defeat hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji had a great start and presented his tackling skills to the UK as if it were for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had bumped into a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions took the lead 5-0 when Osea Kolinsau plunged into the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal to the right with a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tack prevented Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but that didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, after which the UK lost 17–0.
Nakarawa scored the second goal of the resumption, with more than one minute left in the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the more powerless bats of the British team and plunged over the finish line.
After finishing, the opening period ended in 29–0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British were still in the role of apprentices.
Which is largely true.
The United Kingdom made extensive changes in the half-time and managed to hold the Fijians for a full four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the Fijians' excellent team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the score to 36-7 by scoring a goal for the UK in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelago, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the stage.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s purely joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame finished finishing the Fijian cake by scoring a goal in the last moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won Japan's semi-finals 20–5 and the United Kingdom had slipped past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was settled by a British goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and plunged under the poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson, England's 15-player rugby team, seals the victory and ultimately the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
It couldn’t have been more emotional in these games.
From the first to the last bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 victorious bets into history and found additional meaning for their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two on the oars, the third voice of coach Robin Williams echoed on the boat, encouraging them to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the Women's Doubles, making them the first women in British sports history to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their 39th consecutive victory and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the water like swans to age, does not exactly match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the duo’s achievements, but the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who at the time did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
"I had bladder cancer and the tumor could be removed.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the mindset a bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to have been able to start their treatment outside the high season of the sport in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can say so in circumstances like this.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I walked around compartment 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
The rowing itself is a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory, the duo’s thoughts were on Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "At the emotional level, I've been in ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better coach or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The duo have found an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals have not been able to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very busy in the moment.
Helen used to say, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to get out of the way.”
“We did a great job, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything amazing.
We didn’t go to heaven today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race that we did.”
The two think for a year before deciding on their future.
Next month, Glover will be married to Steve Backshall, who is familiar with nature TV shows.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.”
"It took me about six months after London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time it took me about four minutes to realize.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland Replaces Panama Leaked Government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which will be demanded by protesters in the spring following Panama leaks.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the June presidential elections, the criticism of those in power was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has cancelled his latest speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President-elect Barack Obama was the founder of the Islamic State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious and demanded an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink so low to become a commander-in-chief of the army,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of a Muslim-favoured burkini swimsuit on beaches, according to the Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear that exudes religious affiliation may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only blue algae turbidity has been detected at the Pyykösjärvi beach.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the Meriniemi shore, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the waters of Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the intervention limits.
The blue-green algae turbidity observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae bloom, forming blue-green algae mass on the water surface in rafts.
The environmental action follows the situation through increased inspections.
If the blue algae turbidity turns into blue algae blooms, the message board of the bathing area will also be notified.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen from forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s next year’s budget proposal.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal to reduce forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the tax amendment proposal.
The forest gift reduction is proposed to be based on the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income less all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales of wood.
The VM’s proposal starts from that, by making a deduction from the pure capital income of forestry, it prevents the loss of the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model applies only to a small number of forest owners.
The limit for tax deduction linked to the value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It seems to have been pulled too high.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction, he said.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
Forest policy has been taking forest gift reductions for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hail surrounds drivers in Himanga – two cars crashed into a ditch and crashed into each other
Kalajoki Himanga suffered a special rear-end hit on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive cars slipped into a ditch, after which the one at the rear collided with the one at the front.
According to on-call fire chief Harri Pyyhtiä, the fall into the ditch is suspected to have been caused by strong hail.
There were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information on their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku may help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings of the research group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of anticancer treatments by focusing not only on cancer cells, but also on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications, in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’ family home killing continues at court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for second offender
The family home killing of Muhos continues at the court in respect of both sentenced persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family homicide in Muhos.
The other was sentenced to eight years and four months for, among other things, murder as a young person and gross robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of murder was also convicted of serious endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle without rights as a young person.
The judgement of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who had been sentenced more severely.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as the head of the school’s child protection unit in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked the director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The instructor had gotten out of his grip and led the young man to his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind survey, both convicts were in full comprehension at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to leave the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, growing only at the age of 156
The world’s longest living vertebrate is confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
An ice shark that swims in the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female reproduces only at the age of 156.
Ice sharks live longer because they only grow one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists were able to determine the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The eldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although the throw in one direction or the other could be up to 120 years old.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need the rest of the world.
Up to one-third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s proposed change to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced by tax relief, particularly for the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as “revolutionary” when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without it, there would be a huge amount of money, <0x24>1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate now stands at 39.6, after Trump’s reduction of 33 percent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
Urgently decided environmental standards must be re-established and energy deregulation abolished.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "specialists instead of bureaucrats".
“Devastating” trade policy is one of the major causes of U.S. problems.
The Free Trade Agreements will be abolished.
Imports from China will be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and imports from Mexico of 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will oversee the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike Trump, he faithfully read through the speech written by his assistants, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists – including those close to Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program on Friday.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is in a state of turmoil, but a true tsunami strikes in the middle of Madrid's streets - the settlement of the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty.
Almodovar's previous work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a funny satirical comedy, preceded by The Skin I Live in (2011) the top of my career as a Spanish singer.
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama, focusing on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is largely seen as a long retrospective.
Life seems to be the case for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a backlash and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, acquainted with Julieta as a young teacher from the series The Time between Ommelte (2013-2014), will become the second female protagonist.
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a tricky way, but I personally would say that time is crafty and literally a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and Almodóvar films, which are often characterized by such blurring and humour.
It is an evenly acted, restrained, place with good music in some places, and quite sad, with elements of gesture as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is still there, and it starts to catch the eye more slowly as a pure form fact than a working dramatic effect.
The film’s characters suffer from illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface stays the same.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a title person, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same goes for spectacular ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the set-up of the scene, does not improve much.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and somewhat breathless.
Almodóvar has written the script based on three short stories by the Canadian author Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat uniform literary filmization.
The material would have been an emotionally incomparably more robust drama, so many big things – especially the gnawing guilt – are covered in the theme of the film.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's premiere is on 12 August.
Government tries to run elections - People's News
No further cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be massive.
There will be no further cuts.
The <0x24>4 billion saved is enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (coll.) say during the budget debate.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits meeting.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment benefit and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earned unemployment benefits will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Educational cuts continue.
Elections are haunted
Why are the ministers so eagerly insisting that no further cuts will be made on them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the results of the municipal elections in different directions by the governing parties ruin the government’s mood for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the Government Party expects the Finns to lose, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party of Perus received 752 new delegates, most of whom will realise the cost of influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties of approximately equal size depends on the fact that the basic Finns have a strong temper.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s visitation hall have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric of no new cuts, firstly, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out in a drastic manner and, secondly, attempts to soften the blow awaiting the basic Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year’s time, everything will probably be different – if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of breaking down indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will raise 5.9 billion euros next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: indebtedness will not break down or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance in 2018, and then in the parliamentary elections in the spring we will receive what is coming.
With these measures, indebtedness does not stop
It is quite clear that with current measures, indebtedness will not be reversed, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to inspire a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki in the budget’s Awareness Conference are irrefutable proof of this:
The growth forecasts for the global economy have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly recovered since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy conducted at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent during this decade and has increased from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
According to the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left Alliance’s debt bailout was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be approximately EUR 6 billion, which will be covered virtually entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Questionnaire: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four think that the municipality is responsible for organising childcare, youth work and physical activity, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Sector Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also shifts responsibility to a single municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
For the county, it is most obvious that it is responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to delegate to the state any tasks that are the responsibility of the municipalities.
Minor drunk driver runs away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol to Ilomantsinki on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle running without lights, but a young man ran away from the police at a fairly high speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from where to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman ran for the fugitive.
The driver’s breath test showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to traffic safety.
A truck loaded with stones fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stones crashed into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a bend to the left and fell to its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through a door above it together with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the car owner.
A crashed truck spilled hydraulic oil onto the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahdenkylä, in southern Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a slender, slender woman with white hair that reaches under her chin.
Findings and clues about the movements of the missing person are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre hotline 0295440513.
Ingredients of a major disaster in the air - see photo gallery
The flooding of Parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, the chairman of Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get back on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market at the end of Friday evening.
The programme will continue on Saturday with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program is organized as planned.
A surge flow occurs in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a decreasing airflow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm cloud bind heat, and consequently the declining air mass cools and its speed towards the earth accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there will be several surges in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the course of the surge.
A surging current struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5:00.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported to further care, slightly injured.
Air pollution ages Londoners
Research has shown that Londoners’ skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The study was conducted by the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of, say, a peer who lives in rural areas.
Skin ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollutants that originate from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Caci’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk around busy streets on their commute.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man in front of him
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man did not get hit, but the tractor pushed him enough that he was taken to the central hospital for further examinations, seriously injured.
The tractor could not drain further, as it collided with the stones in front of it.
Fast forward with new strength for the coming season
Joensuu Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Champions League, will start the series starting in October from better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
There is certainly a better common tone than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Middleback Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is a passari, while the Brazilian is 198 centimeters.
Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all World Championships since 2003.
The sixth race is now taking place in Tampere, only 2013 missed better than Canada in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was the founder of the national team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, a sport like the stadium bandy was not yet played at the SM level.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later I played ice hockey in Jokipoj in the Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the 1991-92 season of the Finnish Floorball Championships, and spent the next three seasons in Josba.
While playing, he trained the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women’s championship, with a balance of 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen nominated for the national team
Joensuu club Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was chosen to play in the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before this, where she has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from his thighs and is part of the national team’s standard equipment with 117 matches.
Mika Kohonen was nominated for the national team, who was last seen wearing a Finnish shirt at the World Championships last December.
The head coach of the national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach volley championships will be held in Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During the three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs from each series will qualify for the SM Final.
The local colour of the tournament is Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki NMKY, who has been one of the top beach volley players in Finland for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be there this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming up for the pesesistadion.
I haven’t played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu’s spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in NMKY E-Girls.
The main thing in mind is a too big shirt, knee pads rolling around on the ankles, as well as amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasu's beach volley was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior age.
The beach in Kurärälampi has been playing bits since the 1990s.
The action has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors’ SM-tournament competitions, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays alongside Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäkelä in the Finnish Championships.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo is clear.
A realistic goal is a medal.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize drawer, Hasu mysteriously throws.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament in Kisakallio.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, says Hasu.
Falling current knocked down tents at an event for disabled people in Joensuu, a major accident was close

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweating and being energetic.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started their activities as the successor to their home farm almost two years ago.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Becoming a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything at stake.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a garden house, and the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I took part in the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it,” Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have the faith to produce clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Salomon Koli’s goal is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for young food producers of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You will be able to vote for him on the newspaper’s website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country announced a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
Average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (the 1% in July 2016 compared to the 1% in December 2015) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, prices of the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers say it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approximate absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are unmistakable, feature-deforming tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into oblique, twisted teeth, and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts suggested a bigger problem with the company’s differences.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday, and was reported by online publications such as The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them strongly denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the photos were widely distributed, said in her email that the lens was “at least offensive and embarrassing.”
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the equation of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface," but one that has been taken to a degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
The large audience on Snapchat consists of young people who are more diverse in ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more discreetness.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things like this aren't so easily overlooked as they used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, a product manager and designer working on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview he posted on Medium, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the majority of the company’s white and purely male executives and ended his work with a hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"Either there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, which allows them to make these kinds of decisions, or they have colored people as employees, but they are not in a position to dare to express their opinions directly and easily," Zhu said.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the allegation.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff on the grounds of its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups and inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he’s keeping his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn’t OK.”
Congressional expert group says military officials misrepresented intelligence on ISIS
A congressional expert group published a report on Thursday that officials of the U.S. military, the Central Command, modified intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground suggested.
The Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, a subcommittee on intelligence and defence spending, set up a working group, which made an interim report on the "general dissatisfaction" of intelligence analysts in the U.S. armed forces, analysts said senior military officials outlined their assessments of U.S. actions against ISIS.
The Central Command, also known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence results adopted by senior executives of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the United States’ counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground showed, and were invariably more positive than the analysis of other intelligence services,” the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable — our soldiers suffer when high-level policymakers are presented with the wrong analysis,” said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
“Centcom’s management errors reach to the top level of the organization.”
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems that emerged in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by the Obama administration were falsified, it gives an impression of analysts that Centcom leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements, and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than what actually happened," the report said.
“For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military invasion to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.”
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence leaders in the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated intelligence results to undermine the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.”
The group was set up by the Republicans after they learned of analysts' suspicions that ISIS intelligence had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the investigations are still ongoing.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence’s Chief Inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own results, which were partially in line with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to evaluate intelligence about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic representative of the committee.
According to Schiff, this process “delayed the publication of intelligence findings, offended the morals of analysts” and “insufficiently took into account divergent views.”
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to “predetermined or political official lines.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported on a Pentagon Chief Inspector’s investigation that was launched following lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector’s investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions besides investigating whether U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (more and more defence authorities have argued).
Last year’s allegations, however, cast doubt on President Obama’s confidence in the Central Command and its ability to give honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIS intelligence responds to disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that, despite the protests of many analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported only a small number of troops in Iraq and spent only a short time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency against ISIS.
Last year, Hooker’s team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy by building temporary refineries and thus being able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the findings of the study were not communicated outside the Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had judged the testimony given to the Senate as being too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins fourth duel in women’s field hockey and establishes its position in confrontation with Britain
After scoring three goals in a victorious 6–1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored her first two goals for the U.S. women's national field hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keep track of the goals they score."
But here’s what he knows: The Americans have won four games in their Olympics, lost zero games, and are sharing the first place in their team with Britain, which continued its winning streak by winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which determines which of them will finish first and which of them will finish second in a group of six teams.
The first-place finisher avoids a long-term encounter with a dubious Dutch team that won the second group.
Regardless of how Saturday’s game turns out, the Americans have already stirred up their surprising success in these games, four years after being the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, where he first caught a field hockey bat at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played at Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make it to the final list of players.
This was followed by the 2012 Olympics, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not the way it is now.
We've made a complete turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal count in the first half by striking the ball in close by.
India had entered the game without any tournament wins, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1–0 position until the third season when Bam stepped on the pitch.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, winding into the middle field, hit the ball in the finish line and took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her final goal in the middle of the fourth season.
The game was the first in the tournament where US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal blank. In the first three games, the Americans had one hit in each goal.
Briggs is now experiencing his success.
Same as Bam.
"Our placement is good now," says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic hurricane, the trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the time and place, the Olympics are inevitable.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow a fierce message all the time and everywhere.
As if the Olympic flame itself were a flaming beacon that passes from the archer to the swimmer, from the swimmer to the gymnast, and from the gymnast to the triathlet.
You can’t turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in line at a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Olympic first-timer Dooley is charmed by his smile and might well have a name on everyone’s lips that would be visible and belong to the prime time of viewing and listening, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good mood TV ads if he were only a swimmer, gymnastic or even a fencing player.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Farther from the center, partially shaded are lesser-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has participated in the Olympic trampoline, but has never achieved medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
The men’s trampoline seems to go to the Chinese and Russians, and the women’s side is the Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan are defending gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of an underdog, partly because of its uncivilized ear, sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I admit that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons for the characters’ endless bouncing scenes, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the sports that essentially combine in a trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "pushboard".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline that throws them to an altitude of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic sport is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medal hopes must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal that they pursue in television-reported reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and even enough to make the viewer cry.
But I also find it a bit exhausting just to watch the games.
This trampoline offers a breathing break.
The trampoline is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up like an astronaut without weight, falls down and swings easily back up.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect to the sport, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a rush to the finish line or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as an Olympic competition can get.
Women’s qualifiers and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men’s matches will be held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will start at 2 p.m. local time each day.
In the midst of Olympiamania, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might pass unnoticed in the midst of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive male athletes and objectifying them – as US male gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his breathtaking new fan base.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed demonstrations calling for political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses said several protesters were shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests, which are spreading to wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos of the demonstrations, which are supposedly filmed at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security forces are beating young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN’s chief human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, head of research at the International Crisis Group of the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopian people in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive this much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, with the capital, Addis Ababa, even having a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from being a model country for democracy, with human rights organisations reporting on the repressive policies of the government, the opposition in the country being very limited and dissidents being quickly silenced.
Many people have been exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to protest, they will burst out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“All young people are demonstrating.
A whole generation is protesting.”
There are many reasons for dissatisfaction, from land use to the stranglehold of the government coalition.
Following the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously held by the opposition, and as a result they now control the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising at the border with Eritrea, where the escalating situation killed hundreds of people in a battle in June.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit chaos and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitterness that has been burning under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and the availability of the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people still have access to the Internet through proxy servers that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to protests.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhars.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
The Amharics, mostly from the Christian Highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have taken place in the Oromo and Amharic regions.
Many Amharics and Oromas feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between the opposing parties.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," said conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped in Meles' shoes from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he does not have the trust of security forces controlled by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced similar riots was in 2005, when thousands of people protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, were first screwed up and then stolen by the government.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented internal resentment towards the Ethiopian government from intensifying.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amharic city of Gondar, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses, and hate speech against tigers is on the rise on social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft to monitor neighbouring Somalia, but the base has been recently closed, according to the U.S..
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires a tight balance," Abdi says.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama is the founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to draw back his words in his latest campaign controversy by claiming he wasn’t serious in claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton several times this week as the “founders” of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions on the Republican side of the presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the people of their country.
His supporters also find themselves in an awkward situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made a statement at an election ceremony on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted his speech from the day before when he said in several interviews that he had taken his accusations quite seriously.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest storm of criticism arose when Trump tried to re-focus his campaign on the economy as support fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the issue.
He tweeted that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes and said Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism for seemingly urging the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and draws back his words if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that evoke a response among his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages and then "clears out" in one way or another, depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are vague enough to pass through the various sieves."
Instead of tweaking his statements to the general public, Trump has changed his style even more sharply in recent days as his support rate continues to decline.
A new poll published Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist found that Trump’s support is significantly lower than that of Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while Florida is on a tightly balanced footing.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, strongly defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a reasoned, political speech," Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama mistakenly called ‘the lower league team,’ and that’s why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its actions when it did not resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, accusing them of slandering his speeches and discriminating against him.
He scoffed at "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who were trying to find out about him, but he said they couldn't do it.
Some Democrats scoffed at Trump’s explanation, saying it only made it clearer that he was not fit to be president.
A coffee shop that closed due to excessive rent increases opens in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a somewhat lousy café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment, and where there was no Wi-Fi, but which served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café got priced out of its streetside location on Bedford Avenue when the rent went up unreasonably.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals find this loss of a cafe that had to avoid being middle-classized to be regrettable.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB club no longer exists, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one being created.
Last November Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a kilometer north of its original location.
The new Verb Café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb Café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it even reintroduced the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to try something new, too.
Added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches are available with capers and browned onion rings.
Also on the list are the dark-tailed ones.
You can no longer get beer from the coffee shop, but instead you can get juices made from fresh fruit.
After holding the café for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regular customers began to visit Verbi in a steady stream.
“A lot of our old customers got out of Williamsburg, too,” he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited a cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verb, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he’s drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a listing novelty.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the cafe before work, and he always ordered the same thing.
"I walked into the cafe every day at 5:15 p.m., like a machine, and there they were already making my butter bagels with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez wanted to try something new and added new products to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but from time to time he varies his bagels with bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge that the soap shop took the old place.
Soap Cherie owners even offered to make a special soap using Verb’s own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still be able to take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The Polish people who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with pleasure.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee from the café.
The café may also expand to the adjacent building.
However, for many customers it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the café was closed.
When the new place opened up and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like I was coming home," Whitt says.
"I missed the smell of coffee."
The grim food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office at the White House.
Known as a culinaryist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver pate and the Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a culinary demonstration of solidarity with the people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work, A Square Meal, published on Tuesday by Harper, depicts the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to meet a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiron, which opened in the same year as the Great Stock Exchange Crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich, and Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a discussion about eating during a major depression.
"The worries were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut cereal, liver cereal and bean cereal.
They were made of materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they’re enough for an entire meal.”
Andrew Coe is smiling.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, served as a buffet on the principle of “eat as much as you want”.
Women made food for agricultural workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the way the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as butterflies and stews became the main food, and stews were said to be “a great way to exploit the leftovers” because chefs could cover the less attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been a central part of the American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
We tried strange mixtures, where the most important thing was to fill up with calories and nutritional values rather than taste or even a healthy kitchen sense.
While conducting research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman made onions filled with peanut butter that were used as a dish during the crisis.
"It didn't get popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion are not compatible at all.
This was typical for many household recipes.”
Household specialists, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided people’s eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be careful budget keepers and to respond to the challenge of making tasty dishes like carrot-cream paste.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of government reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on a farm in Iowa, he himself ate, like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," Coe says.
"He ate almost in a gold-clad dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the food served at the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst cooked.”
Many foods during the depression were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition, and how science has been applied to cooking.
While writing the book, the couple says that they have started to understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, including why she couldn’t throw away food.
"She was really afraid that the food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"People even started to get sick of his food," Ziegelman recalls.
"For example, the wind hats."
After emptying the main plates at Eisenberg’s lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe picked up their home-made plum dessert, the same one that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a striking name to unpretentious recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly immersed our spoons in a thick brown mud.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe slammed a second time and a third.
"The walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Full reimbursement of Gilead attorney's fees for patent dispute with Merck over hepatitis C drug
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full reimbursement of its attorneys’ fees for a dispute with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. over a patent on a hepatitis C drug.
In June, Gilead was released from <0x24>200 million in damages for infringing two of Merck's patents for Gilead's success drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. A U.S. judge found that Merck had committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit filed on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to exemption from lawyers’ fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which will dominate the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of people with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other to claim private ownership of sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of the Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed forces have captured the city of Manbij from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have taken possession of the city of Manjib in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, after the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF’s Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that the 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIL militants have been released.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
The Clintons earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that her and her husband’s income at the time was <0x24>10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speech fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly earned <0x24>3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her post in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton have released 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax records.
U.S. presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax records, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed for a tax audit and say it is a reason why Trump has not disclosed his income data.
“The transfer is yours,” Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s tax records.
On Thursday, Mr. Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Mr. Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump’s equity, his donations to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has tackled this issue and posted a video online Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans who are urging Trump to disclose his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not his public tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax attorneys and accountants on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential elections.
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Clinton would make sure those who earn more than <0x24>1 million a year pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose headquarters are in the same location as Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffet said he had also been subject to a tax audit and that Trump was not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32% of actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income was earned on wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a total of <0x24>109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder-filled firearm condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and farms without damaging elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of animals.
"As we have developed the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can be confident that they will be able to keep the elephants out of their fields without damaging them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruding elephant is alarmed by pointing a flashlight and playing a trumpet.
If this doesn't work, let's throw in the chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed in the soil is placed in a condom with a fire extinguisher, after which the end of the condom is twisted so that only the ignition cord remains on the outside.
When the fuse is ignited, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a thrower, which fires a firework, known as a Roman candle, into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab 'call' – RT News
A French film director with Jewish roots gave birth to a media outcry after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention the country code of Israel in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, expressed his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the prefix list offered by the hotel.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely wiped out – as if it didn’t exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The filmmaker asked for an explanation at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist’s reply shocked him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was “a carefully considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the action shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of the Israeli area code."
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, who was interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the incident "a great disgrace."
“The incident shocks and shocks us all.
It's a shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany and that this is the hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” said the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the Internet, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply yielding to alleged demands from Arab customers.
“Shame” was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called the incident a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
"There was never a direct order to exclude Israel from the prefix list," wrote a representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets during protests by Brazilian students
Students confronted police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement officers tried to break up a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, wishing to express their dismay at the government’s plans.
Geraldo Alckmin, governor of São Paulo, has proposed an austerity measure that will close nearly 100 public schools and relocate 300,000 students to new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls to temporarily oppose Michel Temer as president.
The student demonstration took place just days after the streets were filled with protesters in favour of the dismissed President Dilma Rousseff, while the Senate voted on the indictment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the lifting of the sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent, according to Levan Dzhagaryan, the Russian ambassador to Iran.
According to him, Russian companies have become more interested in doing business in Iran since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
“Russian companies will continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies will be ready to enter the market.
Further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, reaching <0x24>856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran increased rapidly by 91.5% to <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian foreign mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries whose citizens travelled to Russia in terms of tourist numbers.
And it’s not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner wins British cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner had a reputation in the men's team sprint on the Rio velodrome last night when the British trio defended the 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow played the role of an anchor he inherited from his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland, who made the legend proud of his race to the finish line and his victory over the team of New Zealand, which he considered to be a favourite.
Four years ago, Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after only finishing sixth at the track cycling World Championships held in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first conductor.
Hindes came out just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to close the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Scotsman Skinner was a man in whom British coaches believed and in whom they saw the potential he has now unleashed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set the Olympic record in qualifying, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was a little behind after his lap, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that the Hindes were driving at a higher speed to slow down the speed, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the speed.
Hoy followed from his seat as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes’ eyes as they stepped on the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, says, "I'm flattered by the equation.
I just try to do my best and succeed.
We set the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to falling on the track on purpose due to a bad start.
He later withdrew, and the British rivals had no means of appeal.
This time there was no such problem with a sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were floating in the audience.
Our team has been united over the past three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that it feels great to win at the Olympics.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of ten race championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the last five months, then five days of successful velodrome are ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it’s not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s achievements and winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean earning six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as for Hoy.
Kenny is next to compete in a sprint that starts today and will be resolved in three days.
Kenny, 28, from Bolton, says, “At the moment, I can only rejoice at this.
A team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the victory with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get the knight's title."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team run.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, which was set in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 10:42 p.m.) will take place today on the second day of the race, and Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition officials before qualifying, when the officials invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie set a world record of 4:13.260.
The UK team can now count on its powerful cycling team to take over the mid-stage of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly extraordinary demonstrations of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas behind it, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, amidst allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the racing careers of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the velodrome races held on the first night show that Britain’s already legendary reputation of climbing to the top at the perfect moment is once again being realized.
Portland smelter's future at stake due to termination of electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of employees are at stake when a power company that supplies electricity to the smelter said that one of the plant’s owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of a decision by the Victorian government earlier this year not to extend the subsidies to keep the plant in operation.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of redundancies.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the smelter at Point Henry, which forced Anglesea to close last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter is losing money and in danger of being forced to close its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the factory, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the factory’s production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelter owners to terminate their contracts.
The majority shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold minority stakes in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that physical electricity demand from the smelter will continue.
AGL explains that the contracts are so-called hedging contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a notice period of 12 months and will therefore expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in FY2017," says the power plant.
The potential profit effects on AGL from FY2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by <0x24>187 million “in anticipation of termination of contracts”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect from November of this year, although it still has to figure out why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the weak financial situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelter in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In a speech to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
As a producer, that would not be good news for us,” says Mikkelsen.
The Kardashians: Kendall as September's Vogue Cover Girl
A model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager, Kris, Kendall Jenner, is 20, posing in the famous September issue of the American Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and performed at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account Thursday.
"Watching the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover photo was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashian-style?) scripted video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar bugs Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashian-producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to have forgotten their sister's cover photo.
The plot is cliché and is used in almost all asten birthday episodes (Seacrest says the words, “Did you think we had forgotten you?” as sincerely as the children’s morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to somehow get his other daughters involved in this publicity.
For the appearance in Vogue’s September issue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister, Kim, may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite different.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling release of the year.
A number that resembles a large picture book in thickness rather than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (Fashion’s fashion site calculated that last year’s 832-page book had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the cover star of the September issue is so much anticipated that in the previous two years the magazine’s images have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previous cover models for September include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured celebrities working as models rather than celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising actress Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was given the honor.
The magazine describes Jenner as the success model of her generation, and even if she prefers to be one of the celebrities working as a model, she is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or modern-day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
You can rightly call them talented women who are more successful in the entertainment industry than anyone else.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has had one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Because of his reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "bitches."
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner’s appearance on the cover of the Vogue came out.
However, the constant stirring of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
She's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks at the Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
She's the advertising face of Estée Lauder.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom he photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he shows on reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres reject 160,000 people each year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the country's most vulnerable are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in budgets will have on centres already at the extreme.
In Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal assistance and legal services are already being dismissed, most of them elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in the budget.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Legal Aid Centre, said in a recent report by the National Organisation of Legal Aid Centres that thousands of people are displaced each year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"The public legal aid centers in Queensland are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away when they seek essential services," Farrell said.
“People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unjustified redundancies – all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of Queensland’s most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to lift these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their customer bases, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump Campaign Prosecuted for Threatening An Employee With A Weapon
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump’s campaign after no action was supposedly taken after its leadership was informed that the campaign’s North Carolina leader had threatened an employee with a gun while driving in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former state-run software trainer, in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before, according to his own words, he realized that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign director Earl Phillip “did pull out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed a barrel into Vincent’s kneecap.”
According to the complaint, following a complaint to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same experience as Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini said in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate infuriated the crowd in North Carolina by saying that “subsidiaries of the Second Amendment” – which is considered to be gun owners and armed men – can take action if her opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets the judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media took his words out of context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for the indifferent leadership and Phillip for the assault, assault, and emotional damage caused by them.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking her to comment.
Phillip was not contacted despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to Phillip’s call to Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also boosts the economy and creates prosperity – not only in the local communities and in London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the thing that most interested me in Heathrow, and like the 2012 Olympics in London, we invested enormously in ensuring that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, thus eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
Like the 2012 London Olympics, there will always be people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he is asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to boost the economy by <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget, including Terminal T5 – voted Best Air Terminal of the Year for two consecutive years – and Terminal T2 built in the middle of two of the world’s busiest runways.
They are now ready to produce a third runway, supported by a <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Secretary of Commerce at the Treasury Department.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Ad Blocking in Cat and Mouse Game
The attempts of companies that make money from online advertising to mislead ad-blocking software have turned into a cat-and-mouse game, says one blocking software company.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad-blocking programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where it said users could update their blocking software filters and thus once again block social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it was changing the ad tag codes on its desktop site to make it more difficult for ad blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock said it had cleared up the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of ball-playing between the open-source ad-blocking community and the misleaders has been going on since the ad-blocking was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be doing its own corrections again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook has 1.03 million active users every day on mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad-blocking programs in its desktop app, as the spokesman says mobile ad-blocking programs do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it is updating its user preferences ad tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters, saying they also blocked some of its regular Facebook posts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
“Ad blockers are clumsy and inefficient, and that’s why we’ve instead invested in developing user preferences like ad tools so people can control ad targeting themselves.”
Woman commits suicide by being hit by cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police have called for eyewitnesses to help in an accident on the highway in the early hours of Thursday, when a woman was deliberately hit by several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate deed by lying on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who clearly attempted suicide, including a truck.
A woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. The police are asking them or other witnesses to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
It remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
Was the collision impossible to avoid?
That will be determined by the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases in which drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, according to the newspaper, the person was walking in the dark on the motorway and the court ruled that motorists can’t wait to bump into a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges brought against him for homicide after colliding with a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drunk a lot of alcohol and had passed out on the road.
The court found that the driving style of the police officer, who was responding to the emergency call, was justified and that the man lying on the road was a “completely exceptional and unforeseen situation”.
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Has Been Viable
NASA’s new climate model estimates that Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model to study Venus’ past using the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus’s conditions were ever similar to those on Earth, even though Venus’ surface is hot and anhydrous, and its atmosphere is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotational rate can be explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus had a thin, Earth-equivalent atmosphere and has nevertheless been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In GISS's modelling, Venus rotates slowly and its day-side is towards the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the heat of the sun.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than Earth’s current temperatures.
The model was used to create a Venus story that corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
During hydrogen karate, all that remained in space was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse effect —Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modelling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his role as coach and vice president of the team's ice hockey operations, citing lack of influence over the team's decision-making.
Colorado Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been acting as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of ice hockey with energetic, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
"During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and the vice president of the hockey business of the club must be in full agreement with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the Year for his first season as head coach of the Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and failed to reach the relegation in the last two years.
The Avalanche scored 39-39-4 points in the 2015–2016 season and was five points away from the Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card position in the Western Conference.
In his career, Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups – two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Start Negotiations and Stop Strike
The chief negotiators say wage strikes for North Sea oil workers will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
There have been strikes against Wood Group, a provider of oil field services, on drilling rigs in the North Sea controlled by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, “Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute.”
From the beginning of next week, we will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will deal with problems from fresh perspectives.
The trade unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, in protest of possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its contractors’ tariffs in the North Sea by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with a 10% reduction in the prices of land-based contractors in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the necessary leeway to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to quit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, aiming to streamline its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
The Scottish MEP, Dave Anderson, met with the working class leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts in a generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
“We need an economy in the North Sea and across the country that benefits many, not just a few,” said Anderson.
In 2016, less than <0x24>1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared to around <0x24>7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiadian star cluster
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian star cluster to date.
Using new data, astronomers will be able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times are related to a planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between star weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech University Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiade cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are about to reach adulthood.
They are now spinning faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of stellar wind eject from the growing stars.
These winds have a restraining effect on the stars as they travel through their magnetic fields.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (corresponding to sun spots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggest that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – bigger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiadians' 'dance' that those who rotate slowly are typically larger, while those who rotate the fastest are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiade cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars in relation to rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides a pillar for theoretical models of both younger and older star rotation," says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation and stop dancing.
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
