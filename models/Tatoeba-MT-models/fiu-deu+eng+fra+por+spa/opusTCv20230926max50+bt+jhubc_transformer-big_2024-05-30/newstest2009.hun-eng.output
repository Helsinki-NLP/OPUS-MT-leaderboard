The Prague Stock Exchange is down at the end of trading
The Prague Stock Exchange has corrected its losses after the crash this morning.
Transactions in shares of the Czech Energy Company (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) have reached almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to fall on Monday from the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the decline in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacted to the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the financial sector stabilisation plan there.
Falling Stocks in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in stocks on Tuesday, although some of the losses were eventually cancelled over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index recorded a depreciation of almost four percent during the trading process, but later cancelled some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market fell by 3.6 percent, according to the Taiwanese index.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the U.S. legislators should immediately reopen negotiations and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will feel the consequences.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which should have been spent <0x24>700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroons).
Legislators have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
On Monday, U.S. stocks went through a bloodbath, and leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by nearly seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar drop was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the bill was not passed in the House of Representatives, the index began to fall free.
Congress Retreats: U.S. Government Could Pump <0x24>700 Billion into Banks
The top leaders of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of <0x24>700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroons).
But there is no victory yet.
Congress will have to complete some of the details of the agreement before they can release the final form of the law and their vote.
The draft financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, the chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee.
Senate sources say the bill will probably be voted on Wednesday.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there is a subsequent "sobering up".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We took a big step.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the form of the market stabilization package should be," said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat for the Bloomberg agency.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give a final form to the government fund.
This should buy off unsellable mortgages from financial corporations, placing financial corporations in serious losses and jeopardising the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to reaching a final agreement on a draft that will work and that should also be effective in the market.
The renovation plan still needs to be continued, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
Sign for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling heavily.
Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid said the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before they start trading on Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress’s decision could be the first to affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the trial could be stopped at the last minute due to a problem.
The lawmakers hope that the bill will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked for aid to the system shall be divided into two parts.
As President Bush has requested, the first <0x24>350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
Congress, however, can block the release of the remaining amount, which is set at an additional <0x24>100 billion, and later at <0x24>350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush appreciates progress in talks
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the core idea of the program remained to acquire funds to buy bad mortgage securities that had lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of Busy Dismissal Compensation
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, taxpayers’ protection from losses, the closure of the concessions, and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called “busy” severance pay for directors participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new instalments for mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed draft is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“It’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government allocate losses to each other,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It’s much more important that Congress decides this week whether it supports the plan and gives its blessings as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at the moment," Marek said.
Duel on edge: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to make phone calls.
It seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons why you should buy a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
You’ll probably find it hard to get a high-end expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl records, but from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, you probably dream of such a turntable.
This is similar to travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to sell eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a twenty-kroon market headset.
There are two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
There's a lot to choose from.
The lifespan of the batteries also counts
Some high-end music players can do much more than just play music, but also what most mobiles don’t do.
No other device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, it can also play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you’ll also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a little wonder, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television can take photos.
There are also disadvantages to multi-functional mobile phones.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more times the display sends you to the charger.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy consumers.
Few mobile devices can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For low-cost mobile phones, you should be aware that they will not be playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you're even on a phone here and there, just get a charger for your workplace - this applies to more expensive appliances.
With MP3 players, you won’t have such a problem, even the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a single charge.
The following issue arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB socket and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobile devices without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPods), you don’t need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most mobiles and players create a music library arranged in order based on the artist, album, genre name, or user rating, for example.
Some devices only depict a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific equipment, ask about the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and of course, the convenience of handling.
If music serves you primarily as a background and you listen to it only for a short period of time on the tram, for example, any MP3-playing mobile will suit you.
Any mobile device can do that.
You don’t even have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player can use.
All of them can cope with MP3, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used, and the vast majority of devices also handle WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and your iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service in itself can be a compelling reason to purchase a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the service providers’ offerings are crappy and are usually limited to annual radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
It is generally assumed, however, that such a way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel your phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player lies at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your earbuds with you or at least your hands-free speakerphones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which almost all mobiles have, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobiles will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 2,000 pounds.
Between <0x24>3,000 and <0x24>4,000, you can get a decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of a traditional earbud output.
The best and most technically equipped phones with conventional 3.5mm hole headphones can cost up to 15,000 crowns.
At the same time, the advantage of the players is, among other things, the ease of operation.
Managing the simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) can really cope with everyone.
Minimal function, the handling similar to a previously standard cassette tape recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of collapsing in the form of accidentally turned on mobile internet, nor in terms of the subsequent huge bill for data transmission.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the right card, it can cost up to 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types support only cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can handle up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivert.
Based on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you don’t have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, which makes the handling more convenient than the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface for walkman-series mobile phones as MP3 players sold separately, is the farthest in the industry.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can offer the same service in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual service provider that forces classical providers to substantially reduce their prices.
Maybe it won't be like this for long.
On the Mobil.cz website we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the latest move by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - for some Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple: there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are keen to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has previously stated on several occasions that there is no room for another service provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees with this.
Perhaps it is true that the classic operator with its own network is probably no longer very likely (however, it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is one more option - the virtual provider.
It was the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that led to a significant price reduction, to which classical service providers had to respond.
In the meantime, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile came to the market, there were sounds similar to ours in Britain.
However, it has been proven that such providers have their place and can be truly successful.
However, we do not need to go too far for example.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, it requires much less customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers around the world therefore tend to show up as low-cost – offering cheap calls and text messages, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
Tesco Mobile in the UK, for example, offers at least 50% cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move to bet on a target group as well.
This service is focused on men.
“Real men choose Mobilking—who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar idea to that in Poland can work for us.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for Vodafone, said: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the talks in the Czech Republic do not seem very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It has indirectly shown that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic do not share this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best to prevent any potential competitors from forming.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in launching a virtual service provider, which aims to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing our customers with not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual service provider will be available by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not think that there is a place for a full-fledged virtual service provider in the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
Until now, we have not been addressed by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," he told Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, from the Press Department of Telefónica 02.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other operators.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in agreement with O2, added: “We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which to build further.”
And he added, “In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it’s unlikely that any virtual service provider will pop up.
At this point, we should have a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term.”
Vodafone is focusing on fulfilling its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most rewarding for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build networks shared for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - in one string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean a rise in competition, a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When service providers have something important, they are able to collaborate, as well, the hustle and bustle around the birth of the U:fon.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was probably around the birth of T-Mobile’s U:fone.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
But right now U:fon is a good argument for why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: “The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the arrival of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be highly demanding."
Given the attitude of mobile operators, however, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is absolutely astonishing.
In the meantime, this is not just about the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
Only the Hungarian Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
However, the agency has a distinctive attitude towards the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure has been concluded.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional service providers," said Kristián Chlapua, of the Foreign Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority, in answer to our question.
Such a statement from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, it is more than odd from an office that should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one can abuse their market position.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in the price of mobile services."
However, pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices is probably not in the interest of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In this case, it is truly shocking the very touching consistency of the reactions of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As with the gas stations, the exact same gas prices are probably the result of coincidence and fierce competition.
"The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. no proportionate greater responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing for the telecom regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leader position is one of the many points of controversy.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator is in a leading position after that.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach – the virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
Therefore, it is necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if this argument were not accepted, it should be at least a warning to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators behave in a remarkably similar way.
In the meantime, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they encounter very similar barriers in negotiations with all service providers.
And shifting the responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a trick that is relatively common in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not carried out, although many experts hoped that the situation would improve.
Representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of fake virtual service provider, many of which are already operating in the Czech mobile networks, goes unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
These are multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the selected ones.
The charm lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the service provider, ordering a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-purchase.
"If there were any cases that you are talking about, there could be a breach of contract that we would address and that could lead to the termination of our cooperation with the company in question," Martina Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that news of such activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, there can be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider can defend itself against such a procedure.
In fact, these companies make no negligible profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns about possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that their phones do not have the SIM card in their name, so they cannot have it fully as the general customers of mobile operators."
At least that’s what I think is weird.
There is also another question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual operator?
It should be added that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong authority to expose such activity and if it does not want to, it should not be satisfied with the service providers’ explanation that they did not suspect any such activity and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable fall in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers tried to prevent them more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was at these very moments in the developed countries that regulators intervened, which in no way defended the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then, through formal measures or informal pressure, they created the first virtual service provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are handing the whole thing over to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the service providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile operator, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS would only find it difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we may not be able to call more expensively than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four adaptations of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented new recordings of the state anthem Where is my homeland? on Czech State Day.
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, choir or instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The anthem was modified by Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He has already told Czech Radio that he has deliberately selected young singers with representative voices that are expressive and popular to sing solo variations.
"From the very beginning, both of them, and later at the band, I tried to make sure that the lyrics were clear, that the lyrics were clear and that they were in harmony," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is My Homeland? was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán’s Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, complemented by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously regarded it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "new" hymn
Prague transport company delivers chip card for first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 is the date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger boards subways, trams and buses with an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket.
The coupon is currently available to around 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30-day, 90-day and annual coupons (valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save on their chip cards in the information centers and branches of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy, Rajská zra.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet can finally forget the publishing windows of the metro stations, where until now they had to stand in long lines for line tickets on a regular basis.
The coupon can be purchased online and saved on the Opencard in one of the 13 accounts of the City Library.
“At these locations, passengers have a counter with trained servers to help those interested to shop online and also save their purchased coupons on their card,” said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, the project’s spokesman.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved on Opencards in self-service vending machines installed in a few lobbies.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of the ticket managers, and the passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The coupon is checked by an automatic instead of the driver
Automated machines starting tomorrow are easy to operate.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So, on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, which are mainly used by residents of the districts of central Bohemia to travel to the capital.
"In Prague integrated trains, the guides were equipped with card readers to check the zone validity of coupons," said Filip Drápal from the Prague Public Transportation Scheduling Ropid.
In the buses around the city, the card readers are installed by the driver at the checkout.
Thus, on boarding, the driver must not only be shown the chip card, but the Opencard must also be placed in a specific position on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, a passenger needs to verify the validity of coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel around the city by bus and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service vending machines that save tickets.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudanese want a referendum with the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded the annexation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States.
This is evident from a letter in the South Bohemian Scientific Library’s collection.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It was with this wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also revealed by a letter from a private archive that is now stored in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans in <0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov are urging the US president not to allow the repatriation of the "Shumava County" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler had taken under the Munich Treaty.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops are coming to German territory in no way as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, "People who care about <0xC5><0xA0>umava's fate."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give the Sudeten Germans, in addition to their knowledge of the Czech national character, only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, no understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over <0xC5><0xA0>umava "now and forever."
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, he would consider this territory to be a foreign country to us, which would oppress and destroy the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter read.
The reason the authors were not allowed to sign was allegedly fear of the revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
So if the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans in <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in <0xC5><0xA0>umava County on whether his residents wish to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little na<0xC3><0xAF>ve with current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe it accurately depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Czech Germans had to have at least suspected that they would be expelled from the country, only a few of them recognized the possibility of such an exodus.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others hoped that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, Chalupa served as a Budejovice German in the Baltic Sea Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and sent to the prison camp in Hol<0xC5><0xA1>tynskó, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they would benefit from the Czech language," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported from the country on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history for road safety.
This would also be a description of the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek hopes this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The <0x24>150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, as well as on flyers.
Drivers should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
It wishes to address the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
What does it show in the advertisements?
Emotions are primarily human stories.
This is also confirmed by the “blood” slogan of the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "you're not thinking" on the license plate is written in capital letters.
And there's the word "you'll pay" in the blood pool.
This should symbolize the fact that one can pay with one’s life for a moment’s inattention.
Advertising spots will continue to frighten viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed on a regular basis.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let it go to the drivers
"The drivers are subject to the 'drag, let go' system.
For them, 'let it go' is when they go through the red light, for example, saving time.
"Pull" is a threat of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why we need an information campaign in the press, first and foremost a negative campaign, the psychologist says.
The driver’s warning signs are less effective.
"If a hazard warning sign is installed, it is likely that it will soon merge with the environment and the drivers will not care about it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the interim Israeli government, spoke of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published Monday by Jediot Achronot.
“We have to make an agreement with the Palestinians, which means we have to give back almost all, if not all, of the territory,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to hand over to the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and first and foremost wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet, as one of my best friends did, must give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the attacks in two cities in July that killed a few people and injured a few dozen.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a “special solution to the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites” in the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he stressed.
Exodus from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his views on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered to be an indispensable precondition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not recommend a peace agreement with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (shiite movement); they must give up their regular support for the terrorism of Hamas (shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," he said.
Questions after an accident: Are stewardesses illegal in buses?
The law does not recognize them, they are not allowed to travel on long-distance buses.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to travel on the bus while on the road.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess' activities would be in contradiction with the Transportation Act," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old steward last week was probably caused by the driver of a truck crossing the road of the bus.
Unfortunately, she was sitting next to the driver at the least safe spot on the bus, although two more seats were available for her.
The bus can crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the steward serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It is important to know if the bus has a parking space according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no standing space; which was confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the company’s director.
“We tried to find a solution with the Ministry and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this was withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats," he said.
The law does not know the stewardess.
“There is no clear legal regulation on the role of the stewardess – no legislation regulates this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," says spokeswoman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department at the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law addresses the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus has a standing seat on its registration certificate.
And that's the end of it," he says.
By their distinction, buses can be urban with standing spaces and limited maximum speeds, as well as between the city with standing spaces and permitted higher speeds, and long distance buses with no standing spaces and authorised maximum speeds with seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, traffic safety expert at BESIP, does not see a fundamental problem with the movement of cabin crews on board the bus.
“As we continue to progress, there aren’t many dangers, and we can compare the situation to service on an airplane.
"I'm not sure when there's turbulence and the stewardess can hit her head."
"But if the bus brakes suddenly, of course the laws of physics will apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be solved by the carrier with internal rules,” he says, and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura ready to terminate services
The Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewardess services.
It employs 200 stewardesses.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be risky.
“As soon as I get the impression that stewardess work is risky, I’m going to end it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers on board.
That would also be a cost savings,” he says.
Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency, justified the lack of stewardesses in his vehicles for safety reasons.
“We have no stewardesses, we have been opposed to this from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in some kind of fatal injury," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
An incredible tragedy happened.
A young steward from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who worked for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably left the stopping lane without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to escape, but the right front of the bus crashed.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the sale of the two spaces reserved for the rest of the flight attendants.
"These seats can't be booked on long-distance flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By compensating the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s verdict, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendments?
In the distant future
A clarification of the movement of flight attendants on board the bus could be provided by the amendment of the law, which has been the subject of a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport working on for more than a year.
“The group did not come to any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the motorway and mobile use while driving," says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, a spokeswoman, concluding that the police and employment authorities are responsible for monitoring the safety of buses.
Düsseldorf's hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB’s Board of Directors to the bank’s staff is not lacking in big words.
The merger of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could create "the central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group," the letter reads.
WestLB would introduce a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could give a decisive impetus to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove its capacity to act in difficult times.
The precarious WestLB bank continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is tight.
For savings bank customers, however, the relationship between Deka-Bank, which is famous for its investment funds, and WestLB has long been a topic of discussion – also from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, announced that the bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a regional bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not see any point in merging.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, which comprises half representatives of the regional banks and half representatives of the savings bank associations, mandated the Board of Directors to negotiate the joint business with WestLB.
The capital market business or certain parts of it may be involved in this process.
Negotiations, however, say financial circles, have only just begun.
With 3,000 employees, the name of Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first to emerge in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a moment that Deka-Bank was merging with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But none of these three alliances became anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba’s interest.
The other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a relationship between Deca-Bank and provincial banks has been raised over and over again.
Recently, however, Helaba’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Günther Merl, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, there is a realisation of the need for convergence between the various banks in the public sector.
The relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is now expected to be the first to follow the Bavarian general elections.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it may run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, he could only be a junior business partner, although he has so far survived the financial crisis much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which had an 85% stake in Helaba, ruled out a merger with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
NordLB will be left without any better.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side of the medal.
On the other hand, the question arises of how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl said in June that the German Savings Bank and Banking Association had not yet answered the decisive question of what business model should be used to secure the future of the regional banks.
Finally, there is the possibility of the dismemberment of WestLB, which is obviously not required there.
So the letter from the board of directors says that they are definitely looking for a "full solution".
How this can be reconciled with the merger of the individual units with the Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, Luca says.
Behind them, next to a five-liter barrel from the Kaiser brand, stands a strong bearded man, who tells about 200 people on their way to the Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can draw out of his throat.
Elena first looks at Luca's face and then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses leave at 23.45 to "destinazione Monaco, fiesta della circa" and arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, while the fourth one is reserved exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were singing alongside their flag, and began to celebrate during the night.
And so loud that it's not for Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long coat with artificial fur and wide silver-styled glasses.
He has been traveling to the Oktoberfest for five years, this year alone he has organized three trips.
At night, during the day at the Oktoberfest, at 10:30 p.m.
Accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and a guided tour in German - Marco completed a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already plunging into the night on the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
All right, they'll still need your strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, many Italian buses take a short break before Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco’s team arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past six o’clock as planned, there are already about 50 other buses arriving from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco gives one final briefing, presenting the plan of war.
First, everyone wears the yellow hat.
On the left side is the inscription "Oktoberfest" in fractured letters, and next to it is the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “When the beer tent doors open, run,” Marco cries into the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupying the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, because we will get stuck, and not all the yellow hats will sit on the same bench, but we will scatter in the tent."
The one-liter jar costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.25, says Marco.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the security guards that you're behaving well.
As you leave your seats, they will be taken."
Third, "You'll be back here at exactly 11:30 tonight." Do you understand?
And now we're headed for Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men ties yellow caps to the trees, boards and even the election poster of one of the great Bavarian People’s Party.
We need to be prepared to retreat.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people who cross the Alps are reported to be rushing through the beer tents, with 10% of all weekend visitors reportedly coming from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, while Italian volunteers assist the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics occupies the first place with about 200 medical care, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British at the bottom of the podium (about 60).
Italians are particularly fond of the Hofbräu beer tent.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Lenders
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word “relatively” and even said that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Daxon-listed Munich-based real estate financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received billions in loans from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that loan subsidies amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes in part from private and in part from public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, which finances the state, has lent money to long-term projects and refinanced itself for them on extremely short-term terms, which is no longer possible due to the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio decreased moderately from 1.6 percent to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net income from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, while revenue from credits on receivables and specific securities, as well as from the liquidation of the loan business provisions, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-Depfa group’s post-clearance costs, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax decree and the transactions made for the companies belonging to the group, was the revenue deficit of approximately 16% relatively moderate.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state financer first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
As the classical state funding could make little money, Depfa plunged more heavily into infrastructure projects, as well as private-public partnerships (PPPs) between private investors and the state, and expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate will now have to make depreciations that have a "significant impact" on the group's profit and loss account, they said in a fairly general manner.
In fact, no dividend payments were made.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financer since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, lending between banks has stalled as banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio of approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for a foreseeable period of time and the company is protected from “the influence of the international financial markets that are currently largely dysfunctional.”
According to other sources, thanks to the funds, refinancing will be secured until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate group would not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now assured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and immeasurable nature of the crisis, they cannot be sure of it.
It is not even inconceivable that funding should not be fully mobilised.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Saturday evening’s late-night news, the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, yet its temporary rescue failed to calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are fairly good.
While the first-ranked debts have hardly changed, the rates of the back-ordered bonds have fallen significantly.
The crisis affects in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, apparently, the maturities beyond 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds used to appear as speculative investment alternatives, their value stability must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as the banking crisis intensified and the financial institution took the crisis almost to the home with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start with the payment of annuities on time.
Or there will be something that almost no one hopes to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports of partial nationalization, the probability of certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to dispose of their investment can cause sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to constitute a reserve for taxes payable on foreign exchange gains over the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself to Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start laughing: The German chick is totally "kavai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - in her new exchange blog, she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and I travel by train for 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, luckily I wasn't lost.
The beginning of teaching in Tachibana does not seem to be taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to squeeze in from 8:00 until a short conversation with the teacher begins at 8:40 a.m., the "home room".
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I wore an old skirt from my hostess, with a blouse, blue knee-strings and black leather shoes.
So in this dress I stood in front of the cathedral and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvana, I am from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, laughed and waved, and I kept hearing the word "kavai."
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide and felt honored to have the exchange student seated next to her.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the bell rang, they rushed in.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they bore a hole in my belly -- and it was quite difficult to understand the Japanese English.
In the break, everyone unpacked their berths.
My host also prepared such a lunch for me - it is completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, a salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat wrapped in tofu.
I have no idea what I eat in Japan.
The dishes look strange and have a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Well, maybe except for the salty plum broth, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bento is not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a bento made with her own hands, which she assembles especially artistically - in the hope that she can get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can see this here.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm simply fascinated."
After all, I’ve been reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of the comics and the culture they describe, I started learning Japanese sometime.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
These are very valuable here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a moth flees in the event of danger, does that mean that he feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge", famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?" in one of its series.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species and dissect the questions of perception, or consciousness in general, we come to a difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave in a similar way, which leads some researchers to infer comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to the animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This wide area is more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are, or being able to plan and make decisions, we can reasonably assume that humans are different even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Because a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may be like in the case of other animals.
If consciousness is not measurable as an internal and subjective thing, and because of special hardware it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my explanations relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals could be studied regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, this hypothesis, which was also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this hypothesis underscores the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What is the consequence of this in terms of emotions?
This is due to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activities.
What we call “fear” is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are specific to primates and especially to humans.
In addition to the linguistic character, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states so that we can describe them to others as well as ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions are derived from simpler activities in the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, as is Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in species-wide emotions.
In purely theoretical terms, I cannot deny this, but I find it unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be fear in both cases: How can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, just a similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
While neural comparisons help further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, cockroaches do not have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in humans, how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm researching the emotional behavior of rats rather than their emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level, as long as we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I don’t research language and consciousness, nor do I research emotions, because I don’t know if they exist.
For others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Ivan Vasyunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees in the UEFA decision in Bordeaux the confidence in Ukraine and the evidence of their belief that Ukraine can organise the European Championship together with Poland," Vasyunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
Both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible to reduce the number of European stadiums from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We need to work at the top speed now," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time."
In Poland, they decided to take a more radical step.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by Independent Inspector Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a “serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
“We assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this would not adversely affect the preparations for the European Championship in 2012.
In the last season only, several first league teams had to be placed in the lower class due to manipulation, and the league reserve had to be postponed as well.
The outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back.
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she has a problem with her ex-husband.
The One Who Strikes - and Strikes Back
The War of the Late Roses with Meg Ryan – Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood actors are fighting a vicious battle seven years after their divorce – in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan said last week for the first time: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain.”
And it wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis had cheated on him.
The psychic stripper is due to a press release on Ryan’s new film, Women, which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid resolutely responded to his exclamation of an unfaithful husband: "It's terrible," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is boringly repeating and spending the story of our relationship."
In addition, it is also "unfortunate" that 16-year-old common boys, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce causes to a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of a pair of twins.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following side clipping: "My life will continue anyway.
I can be happy to have a wonderful family where everything is all right.”
Lower prices of airfares and hotel rooms
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Prices for flights and hotel rooms are once again lower, summarizing the results of a study conducted by American Express, a travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, found a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After many years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
In the period from April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the dollar’s low exchange rate, which has led to “weakened travel habits for American tourists.”
The decline in hotel room prices is more likely to affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices is a European record.
There was also an increasing change in airfare prices in the first quarter.
Due to the higher price of kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1% more than in 2007, and high-fuel long-haul flights were 29.2% more expensive.
Between April and June, the prices of economy class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, prices showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, falling by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The price of domestic flights in Germany has been cut by half, according to the study.
The reason for the price decrease is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company says.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the aviation market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
The tense situation is confirmed by the cancellation of loss-making flights by airlines, and a number of airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
The HSV 1:0 blood of Gladbach
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV came to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep dive for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player got into the game only late and his raise bounced back from the goal.
His well-formulated message was convincingly out of his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the corridor leading to the cabins of the arena in Hamburg.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of the people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying greater authority than some former players.
So his request was heard at the appropriate place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreedly raised his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg manager Martin Jol.
His command could have been similar: Here with the second goal!
The order has not been executed.
"It wasn't always a beautiful sight today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt had a "lazy" idea of it.
The 1:0 (1:0) goal was scored by the Hamburgers due to the head of Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachians could not inflict pain on the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and the chart on the screen, which presented their team as the championship's class number one.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
It suggests that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself thanks to its lately committed acquisitions - Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern - but it is not brilliant yet.
"We need more senses and tricks," Jol insisted.
After the rejection
Wall Street is full of fear.
The Dow Jones fell temporarily by 700 points due to the first news of the failure of the rescue package.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day.
Later, the Dow grew a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was down 5% and stood at 10,579 points.
Nasdaq, who sells technology papers, dropped by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
Dow’s biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a loss of 14%, followed by Bank of America with a loss of 12%.
None of the papers got stronger.
Goldman Sachs's shares have plummeted nearly 10%.
Just a few days earlier, large investor Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage papers.
However, the amount will not be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the State would receive share options vouchers from financial institutions, which could be used if the exchange rates developed properly, reducing the burden on the Treasury.
European and U.S. and Stock Prices in Decline
The billions in aid to European and American banks do not dispel investors’ doubts.
The share price of Hypo Real Estate, a large German bank, is plummeting and taking over Dax.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is declining in spite of the state-planned rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The value of the Munich real estate funder’s shares fell to a quarter despite a rescue effort by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
Dax dropped below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and scored 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets around the world are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges have only known one direction: in London, the FTSE showed a decline of 3.2 percent, while in Paris, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26% to 11,743.61 points.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex scored 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheimer has subscribed for 23 million new shares.
The company said it would not sell its Thomas Cook shares.
Dark matter affects the flight of spacecraft
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew in space for nearly 18 years.
Due to the soon-to-freeze fuel pipelines, he is at risk of frostbite.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly, has been causing confusion among scientists.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational swing maneuver of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of an object such as Earth.
In this way, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, used this physical trick.
But what has amazed scientists for years is that flying objects are not fully behaving as they would be expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, abnormalities occur in the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
This phenomenon is called swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which conceives the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, still firmly believes Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the swing-by anomalies by using so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be very close to the Earth," Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter was discovered by space scientists only ten years ago.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to affect other celestial bodies.
However, matter itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists have calculated that a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt
After spending ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were taken to Egypt are once again free, the Italian foreign minister said.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting that preceded the release of the hostages, six hostages were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens have been abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Over and over again, the Germans are the targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists taken away in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arabic TV and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our compatriots and other hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their health status,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: An Egyptian security official said the hostage-takers had already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," the official said.
"It was all about taking the hostages," "when suddenly there was a surprise."
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot six kidnappers in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two others.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "al-Masri al-Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostages will release the female hostages once the ransom has been paid.
The men are held captive by the kidnappers until a safe escape route is found.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
'Suicide' leads to stepfather violence
In court, a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had abused her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, in Stithians, Cornwall County, spent six years in jail after confessing to eight attempts of sexual assault.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a statement, "I feel responsible for his death."
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in the Plymouth town of Mutley on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and bandaged her eyes before intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and relocated to Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was revealed that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was persecuted by the nightmares of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, was said to be “emotionally dead” and “did not live.”
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a conflict with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his confession in a letter: "I always tied him and bandaged his eyes.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure that was terrible for your victim, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
But even more intriguing is the fact that if it had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice.”
The judge added: "I draw your attention to how Stephanie's parents said the crime you committed had an impact on their daughter over the years.
If that had not happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
The official who lost important data was charged.
According to BBC reports, a government official who forgot top-secret documents on a train in June has been accused of violating official secrecy.
The man was on a mission from the Department of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the mildest accusation of violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional conduct.
Frank Gardner, a correspondent assigned to the BBC’s Department of Defense, said the move surprised many at Whitehall.
“They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the incident as an internal matter,” he said.
An employee who cannot be named has been prosecuted on the basis of section 8.1 of the Act. This section is about the retention of information.
The State Prosecutor's Office has suggested that the charges against the officer should be represented by the Metropolitan Police for the man's rather sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included covert surveys on Al Qaeda and Iraqi military capabilities.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unfamiliar location.
Housing Cooperatives Pay for B&amp;B Account
Housing cooperatives in Britain could expect a bank account of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion on protecting 2.6 million account holders’ deposits at Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors’ money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), said it was “annoying” for companies and their members to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that institutions that have acted prudently ... now have to pay the bills of institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that every company has to pay the amount of deposit it has. Companies share 18% of the cost among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the trade union director for housing companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that institutions that acted prudently during the boom of the housing market have to pay the bills of far less cautious institutions.”
According to BSA, none of the companies have been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“We need to look at this issue in all respects over the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a substantial bill,” Cole said.
Interest payable in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full yearly interest rate, which can be up to twice the current one.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-penny increase in February and following a survey conducted by a consultancy company.
It is up to retailers to decide whether to pass the price increase on to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey’s milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Bangladesh’s former MP’s request to be released
A Bangladeshi court has denied a request by former MP Sheikh Hasina to defend himself, which means he may be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court refused to defend him on the charges of extorting 50 million takas (<0x24>729,700) from a businessman during his tenure as a member of parliament.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina’s former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country's military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was conditionally released to go abroad for medical treatment, the conditions for being released do not make it clear whether he will be able to retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
“The Court of Appeals has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request for bail as it is not necessary because he has already been temporarily released and is undergoing treatment abroad,” said attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal."
His attorneys argue that he needs to defend himself in order to be able to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the military-backed interim government took over, but was released from prison in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia have both denied all charges against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organized polio vaccination program due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban’s pledge that they would not attack or hinder the work of the thousands of personnel carrying out the vaccination.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV has been rejected
BskyB’s appeal against the Competition Committee’s decision to reduce its interest in rival television broadcaster ITV has been rejected.
The Competition Court of Appeals ordered BSkyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission found that BSkyB’s shareholding was an obstacle to competition and gave the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its shareholding in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the acquisition of BSkyB’s shareholding in ITV jeopardised ITV’s independence, urging the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
Virgin’s director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom supervisory board all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV shareholding was a senseless and disproportionate compensation, especially given that BSkyB had stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. Attorney General's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. Attorney Generals in 2006.
The move was followed by a report by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice on the case criticizing the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because the prosecutors were feared to have been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have attempted to lie to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated or cleared," Inspector General Glenn Fine said.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to order witnesses to testify.
The series began in December 2006 when the U.S. Attorney General removed nine prosecutors from office.
At the time, it was said that the prosecutors had been dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed state prosecutors received no worse assessment than many of their other colleagues, which led many to conclude that the dismissals were motivated by political considerations.
Some prosecutors were involved in the criminal prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against Democrats.
U.S. Attorney Generals conduct investigations and court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
At the time, Chief Justice Alberto Gonzales was the target of attacks on the government and eventually resigned.
Several other officials of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In his report, the Chief Inspector criticized Gonzales’ role in the case, saying the Attorney General was “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, “dimitted” from his leadership role, and “remarkably removed himself” from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former assistant to Bush Sr., have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Epic Recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said he felt it was an honor to receive the award.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 popular harvesting album.
Coldplay has received the most nominations for this year’s awards and has been nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song composed by Jim Steinman required a very large sound, and that sound was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an instrumental session of almost two minutes.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the charts for almost nine years, and has sold more than 40 million copies since then.
Meat Loaf -- his real name is Marvin Lee Aday -- has been struggling with health issues lately, including having surgery for arrhythmia in 2003 after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it was discovered that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street, often forgotten and perhaps soon sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards and other side roads, some of which are famous, others are purely practical.
However, many trained taxi drivers and locals who have lived here for a long time would find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it before.
The small street is in East Village and heads north from First Street—without reaching Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long and resembles a dusty alley rather than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find on a standard map.
The street has admirers.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
You want to re-cover the Extra Place, and you want to make sure that you can get to the shops and boutiques of new buildings on a cleaner road.
Among the admirers of the street are the long-time neighbors, who were caught in the shattered street by the fact that it was the only remnant of the area’s past before renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the city’s building conservation and development department, has no interest in insisting on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality’s land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, District Director of the No. 3 Municipal Council.
“There are very few areas already in the city’s possession, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city,” he said.
“We may be talking about proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to ensure that it remains accessible to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to refurbish the small street and provide seats, some of which would be used by a café, which the builder is expected to rent out an area.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first announced at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company would like to use the street, but did not insist on owning it.
"The main point of Avalon Bay is to renovate this degraded alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Bureau, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office’s job was to improve the buildings, not to manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, the Extra Place does not have much historical significance.
Some say it was named "Nobody's Land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his countless children, and the narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
Closed in 2006, the back exit of the CBGB, the punk-rock monument, opened to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most notable for the photograph taken on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes, pieces of barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle-class took over the East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the hands of the community.
Others cite Extra Place as a rarity, a virtually unchanged piece of the city that must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" ("The Book of Lamentations: A bitter nostalgia of the extinction of the city"), posted on his blog a part of the story about Extra Place that appeared in the "City Rumor" section of the weekly newspaper "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end street that is dark even during the day, bordered by rusty, iron storage doors and slatted windows, and where weekly newspapers are carried by the wind in the sewers."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran over at the end of the street, next to the back door that used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a high-priced clothing store built in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-litre beer bottle was lying next to a pile of discarded, fresh newspapers.
Some passers-by have said that they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think it could be renovated.
Fields said some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I have spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies and senior director of education research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why Middle Class Needs School Choice."
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking territories.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is true.
To overcome such performance gaps, Obama’s educational plan explicitly supports, among other things, “temporary bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on non-English school education, will overcome his interest in overcoming the big performance gap.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contract Primary School in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the students at the school are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than one-third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Despite this, 100% of fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Equally impressive is that 93% of fourth graders passed the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved with the instrument that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street director, the school’s educational principle is the “full immersion” of English students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: “We have had a tremendous success in seeing that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn’t notice who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months ago.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set schools such as Sixth Street Prep as examples for other schools that teach a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-students?
The school’s achievements should make the answer clear, but because of its own party’s education policy (National Education Associations have long advocated bilingual education), and because it has consistently advocated bilingual education itself, we can’t be sure of Obama’s reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently disrespected the issue when he said people shouldn’t worry so much about the “exclusive Englishness” of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should be able to make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the gap between the results, he should study seriously the models that work, rather than look down on them and ignore them.
Renewed concerns about the economy led to a sharp fall in oil prices
Oil prices fell steeply on Monday due to concerns that America’s rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
Securities on crude oil fell 7% to <0x24>99.80 this morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than <0x24>20 per barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost <0x24>90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before being again affected by the immeasurable uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again concerned, even after Congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement this weekend on the largest economic rescue operation in history.
The news has been overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As a recent event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate talks over the weekend, “the rescue operation seems to have failed to revive the mood for trading on the stock market.”
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, such as oil, is also expected to decline.
"The future of the stock market, interest rates and currency exchange rates worldwide has become uncertain," an analyst at Deutsche Bank wrote to investors.
"We think the commodity market will not be avoided by the 'epidemic' either.
The biggest question in terms of commodities is the extent to which the U.S. "disease" infects the whole world, especially China.
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, banks’ analysts cut back on their expectations for next year, decreasing their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets’ jersey than anyone else in the past eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, a defensive end player, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals sluggishly played in full harmony with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, which was the perfect prelude to an afternoon where their collaboration developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks in a row fell 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't mind the trouble," Favre said of all the passes given to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We’ve been able to communicate well with each other no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornerback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards, which scored a touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing moment of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the score at 34:0.
That was the best result the Jets have ever achieved in a quarter.
When they asked Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the game's mind-blowing character, he said, "Is it the second or the third quarter?"
When he was told that the Cardinals had scored 21 points in the third quarter without the Jets having scored one, Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short period of time.”
The rested Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie has once again shown why many consider him to be the best medium- and long-distance runner to have ever lived when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run the 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds from his previous 2:04:26 result in Berlin last year.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his career in a wide variety of disciplines, winning world championships or reaching world records in almost every race from the 1500m to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing that air pollution would exacerbate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
Under almost perfect conditions, Gebrselassie won in sunny weather, starting at 9<0xC2><0xB0>C and ending at 13<0xC2><0xB0>C on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since non-marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade since Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had a cramp in his legs and was unable to train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, it was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
He has received some criticism, especially from Kenya, an East African rival of Ethiopia, that he uses too many aids in his races, usually avoids many world-renowned marathon runners, relies on his speed runners as if he were running on a track, and puts world records ahead of the race spirit.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie’s magnificence in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint at 1:02:04 on Sunday with the help of four Kenyan speed runners.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the speed runners got tired.
Just 4.8 kilometers ahead, Gebrselassie overtook Kwambai with a final sprint, finishing second with 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest win, 2:19:19.
The world record is held by British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a 2:24:14 result.
He was unable to attend the Beijing Olympics due to an alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first, he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then pursued them after running about 30 kilometres.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of the blacks
In the Greater Orlando amusement park - a few miles from everything that shines, is loud and mighty - hides a quiet little town where the pride and complexities of the African-American experience of life were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country, which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guayavas, and two school towns without prison."
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival. The Eatonville ceremony is held in honor of Harlem’s most famous female writer, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city he describes and makes a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida Guidebook of the Federal Writers Project of the Crisis Age, is separate from its surroundings.
As independent, dignified, and self-absorbed as it was in the 1930s, Hurston wrote that city blacks in Florida were often unwilling to share their real thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on the race issue, many here are distrustful of outsiders’ glances.
"We are very careful how our story is told," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here her entire life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of blacks’ standpoint, but it is also a community of nearly 2,400 people, where poverty indicators reach twice the national average.
Partly a literary node and partly an example of the sometimes despised, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the people here are both proud and defensive.
The picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (this is how everyone calls Hurston).
In honest, strong dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) he presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, like a drum roller, introduced his readers to Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then explored the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road, we find a modern public school with a white border on a brown background, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which are maintained by Howard Miller, although he can barely read or write."
He mentioned the widow’s new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells all kinds of drinks and whatever may be needed in the temporary accommodation.”
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also illiteracy, remarrying, and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description did not really please everyone.
"Zora said things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who Hurston made immortal by quoting the slippery songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as a living separated man who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a roaring Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes and wearing long pants in a city where people still take pride in their dignified dress.
"Most people were fascinated," Franklin said, "but a lot of people were grumpy."
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair: "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were never re-published.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with much of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she previously lived.
There were no significant commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us," said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, "Wrapped in a Rainbow."
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in community life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the state-connected Interstate 4 highway on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult period in history.
Among other things, forced integration ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles against racial mixing had a taste of hatred with the community.
"At that time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to force integration, stating that Brown v. Board of Education "insults rather than respects my race."
Today, residents say that although the desegregation of schools has been positive in some respects, it has weakened the unity of the people of Eatonville and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
"Black children are accustomed to being hugged," I remember, "the man hugged his teacher both morning and evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the non-profit organization 'Preserving the Community of Eatonville'.
"This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, we had cultural differences," Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rise—black writers, actors, and artists who have transcended prejudice, as she did, with such optimistic self-confidence and lines as, “How can anyone deprive themselves of the enjoyment of my company?
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker pilgrimaged to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the shelves of bookstores and once again made him one of America’s role models.
The road construction project was about to start just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began organizing a Hurston festival to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the celebration every January.
Several years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
"Because of the five-banding of the main road, the community has been revived, turned to full speed, which is a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city’s image of itself.
An increasing number of people outside the city appeared, such as attorney Rachelle Munson, who began attending church here in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, a new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened on the rebuilt and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains the cuckoo egg of Florida: not exactly ten kilometers from downtown Orlando, but sometimes you feel like a suburban side street during summer rain; as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Ninety percent of the population today is black.)
They are still cautiously welcomed by outsiders who come here in search of Eatonville's story and story.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things—such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco painted by a white man and depicted blacks working in the fields—should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many, including confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their separate communities will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown grew.
Young people in particular are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with its problems and everything, neither better nor worse, as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as the other races and ethnic groups in America.
The words of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work for the local government or police that he believes need help.
And the younger ones seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, like the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," Alondra Kenon said on Sunday.
"But if you stop and take some time to get to know your history, this is a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we all speak the language of finance
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the newsstands and the huge TV projectors in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realise that with glass-walled, bee-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who control New York are living through the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers still rammed their metal tea trucks along the sidewalks, delivering trays loaded with muffins for the morning meetings.
There are still Spanish-speaking men crawling among the blocks, carrying like a human mule fifty pairs of ironed shirts hanging over their shoulders in a loop that resembles a yoke.
Office workers are still standing in line for their morning sweet pastries at the food carts on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I did not feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I had deliberately planned to take care of the matter at my local branch of J.P. Morgan Chase during the afternoon's recess, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cashier’s window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy’s store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me, I learned later from Starr, the banker "ordered to me", had the same intention as I had.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate only in one state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of <0x24>327 billion, has been bankrupt, and when New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank bailout with savings of <0x24>440 billion.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes most of the capital injections out of Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at a local Chinese department store on her phone talked about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and his huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she was complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform janitor of my apartment in her 50s, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my groceries, as we used to do.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I have invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I change, I don’t take risks.”
Muslim tombs defamed while Austria tipped to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, at which the organization "Cities Against Islamic Conquest" was introduced.
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed by a red line.
According to the police, far-right extremists are responsible for the abuse of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which occurred on the same weekend when far-right parties made significant advances in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but investigators said they were trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" at the hearing of the grave abuse that occurred shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience check after yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance tipped to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for a strong anti-immigration law by the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, and some of their slogans were branded as xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who received more than 18% of the votes, said he was campaigning against headscarves and burqas and disliked foods allegedly linked to Islam.
At the party’s final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” that would prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyses conducted immediately after the elections that led to the victory of the far right, the change was largely due to the young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a rock star convicted of child rape, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges have decided to suspend Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities that he intends to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after submitting to the court evidence of convictions for rape of children against Glitter.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was not involved in the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning attorneys.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent police filed a petition with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd’s planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't appear in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has notified the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is obliged to do so by the law on the register of sexual offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you can be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they don't want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and his possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: “The Kent Police are doing everything in their power to protect children both within the country and abroad.
“In our opinion, it is easier to control someone by not leaving the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The Kent Police believes that the most important task is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behavior of persons on the register of sexual offenders and residents of the county in order to minimize the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities did not allow him to pass the passport check, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the county police and immigration office insisted on returning to Britain.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the West London court in uxbridge, as he was admitted to the register of sexual offenders under a court order, as requested by Scotland Yard.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a source from the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for the Interior, was reassured and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take photos on stage because I want to present the artist from a personal side.” – Günther Bauer
There's no set, no rollers, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are close to the body, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate, distant moments, when we can observe a personal movement, grasp the depth of a captured gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the idle, yet expressive hand of the artist, who is about to perform on stage.
In the German photographic series Flamenco-people by Günther Bauer, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of masters.
Through the photographs, the iconography of flamenco is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco's Month of Photography, "reflects the flamenco's growing international importance every day," the creator said, adding that Flamenco-people could be "anyone, as the viewer discovers that these images do not depict artists in a typical way.
These people shot on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, cheerfulness to the stage... and captivate the audience.
Stage photography, however, is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personalities of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera.”
At the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997, taking portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
These portraits evoke classical photography thanks to the camera and subject selection.
The use of various stylistic tools, however, breaks with traditional imagery and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's vision of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, however, that changes from day to day and is always fascinating."
It is not dance, not even singing or music in itself, but rather the personality and character of the artist charms the audience.
The guiding motif of the works to be seen in the El Photomata Gallery these days is the search for the encounter with the essence, the artistic varasz, which becomes visible through the way of perception, being and display.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are the names of this collection of photographs that will feature some sixty artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, which will soon be the subject of an album featuring the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraits prompted him to repeat the idea with the "Portraits of Veterans Athletes" series ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: “I like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
You meet people, people you don’t even know, or people who only take a few minutes to take a photo.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realise my ideas.
The exhibition entitled Flamenco-people, selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, can be viewed in the El Photomata Gallery at Calle de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "ready for recklessness"
The location and plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on his new novel, which stars Irish nationalist Roger Caseman, who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled to the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner in Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia admitted that his current work is “ready-to-be-audacious” and “all signs indicate that the novel should not be written.”
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I hope I'll get to the end someday," he concluded with these words at the Aqueduct Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts and Opinions, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of visitors for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he fulfilled his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His performance filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
After the greeting of Félix Romeo, he was received by a devoted audience. For the audience the hour quickly passed, during which the Peruvian writer, with an amazing memory and a great deal of humor, told how he developed his vocation as a writer from the extraordinary adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live life; how he bridged the lack of inspiration with a disciplined writing method, he worked hard.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but he added, “I don’t think literature is just a fun or citrus life experience,” because it affects people and makes them think, so he urged writers not to indulge in the temptation of lightness and take responsibility for their profession.
Pozoblanco's farewell is shorter due to the harsh weather, horse riding bullfights are also cancelled
Traditionally held as the final chord of the Pozoblanco holidays, the equestrian bullfight was cancelled yesterday morning after prospective equestrian toreaders found the arena unfit for the fight.
As a result, the committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
The weather conditions severely damaged the ceremony, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was cancelled due to the rain.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought with the bulls of Castilblanco.
There was a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was lifted up on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won a number of awards and an ear as a trophy with two bulls, but he owed this to the audience rather than his own performance.
However, it was El Juli who made little contribution to the fame of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable walk with the second bull, we managed to get most of the audience out of the commotion.
In Alava, a truck carrying two tons of hashish attempted to escape road control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Territorial Police conducts traffic inspections in the administrative district of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authorities stop a van in which two passengers are traveling, and the passengers try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not noticeable at the same time.
Investigators pursued the passengers and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government's Home Affairs Department said.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place in the municipality of Armiñón, where <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Inspectors conducted traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
He was pursued by investigators, and the vehicle stopped a few kilometers away on the stop lane, with passengers fleeing from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hash bales filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by the police to undergo a more thorough examination and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the inspection proved that the vehicle’s fake license plate does not match the information in the van’s papers, so the arrested person is also being prosecuted for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation with the aim of arresting the other suspect who, as already mentioned, escaped from the highway, and of determining the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was taken to the police station to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, judicial proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
An eyewitness said he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesman for the California traffic control agency told People magazine.
Around 4:30 p.m., the witness said Locklear “pused the gas to the floor, whimpered the engine, tried to leave the parking lot both forward and backward, and repeatedly crossed his sunglasses in reverse.”
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "worried about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed motorway traffic.
"It looked confused," so patrolmen took him to a specialized drug and alcohol testing center.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately ruled out. The spokesman also said that the first impressions of the officers suggest that she was under the influence of the Locklear drug.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug, and was taken to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for his anxiety and depression.
Lamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
IU Secretary-General Gaspar Llamazares, a representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the unit will decide on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, the former Youth and Sports Council of the Municipality of Seville. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to give benefits to his family members.
“In these matters I am largely a federalist, and this is indeed a matter for the Andalusian organization,” Lamazares pointed out the procedure that the party must follow against a former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that "transparency" should be kept in mind when investigating possible irregularities committed by Silva: "At IU has always advocated maximum transparency in such matters."
He added that training includes “a strict code of ethics for civil servants.”
"Blood of May", an epic creation by Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós’ National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who recalls the famous anti-French revolt of Spain in May Blood, the greatest work of his filmography, with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate in his well-known novelist work the human abundance and social analysis that he has always admired. All this was told today at the film premiere in the company of Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría to a large audience of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour May Blood will be shown in theaters on Friday, and later on it will be screened as a miniseries by Telemadrid for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of the literature of Galdós, has made his childhood dream come true with this filming. All this is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned her from the Province of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events of 2 May in Madrid. Garciok they accept the invitation on the condition that Epi's story was based on National
The 15-million-dollar budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and was a special opportunity for Garci to present "the confused Spaniards, who mistakenly stood for the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence had plunged the country into huge backwardness with Ferdinand VII's reign," he said.
The director, however, regretted that he had not been able to count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, which more than doubled the May Blood, and was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, is written with Horacio Valcárcel.
So the director of Restart used his usual way of working, recording the scenes with the actors he had started rehearsals with before the shooting. Casting wasn't because Garci thought it was "humiliating," and because, as he said, "the craft of directing is going to the theatre and cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we work in."
Several May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillen Cuervo, have not stepped in front of their camera for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Oscar, believes that this year’s nominees representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, namely May Blood, the Seven French Billiard Tables and the ultimately selected Blind Sunflowers, do not represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, “where it should be presented,” he said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for posterity, and then you realize that it’s all about success, and then you’re happy to make another movie,” Garci says with nearly 30 years of career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in oriental dance.
Throughout her busy life, she has been a pioneer in the fight for women’s equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against wearing corsets that prevented women from moving freely.
A revolution in dance and aesthetics broke out in wartime Europe, and Isabel Bayón was amazed by her life.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, who recommended Tórtolá to my attention, whose personality really fascinated me."
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell the story of her life, but to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, from the "butterfly dance" to the guajira, or from the "snake dance" to the tango.
"He danced sensually and others say that's what characterizes my style," he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after The Open Door, is now singing again at Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of her former students.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I’m glad that you accepted the invitation, and I’m very honored that you’re performing in my play.”
In addition, the production includes music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; percussionist El Pájaro, violator Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays the real diva as a permanent character constantly besieging her love."
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels across Europe and travels to countries that were still far away at the time, including India, the United States and Italy.
"The reason I wanted to make a memory of him was because his personality had a great impact on his age, but nowadays his work is no longer known and even less appreciated," Bayón said.
The show starts tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "The Diary of a Newly Married Poet" is also published
The premiere of the first illustrated edition of Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The premiere is part of a series of programs titled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) Anniversary of their death.
In this way, the final chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-edition of the work, the re-edition of the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet’s memorial house, and the traveling exhibition “Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Plum Tree for the visit of New York”.
The Cultural Commission of the Andalusian Regional Government obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the journal of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
“God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in The Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness caused by Newman's death in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it was to get an Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
He was known to be ill,
But still everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "being made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the heroes of the cinema and the homeland left in a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people lose their virtues easily, and there are very few people we can look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, he was truly the embodiment of the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won causes, from the drug foundation in memory of his first-born son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his home-made organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had difficulty overcoming its suicidal nutritional culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration spread throughout Hollywood, regardless of nationality or origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said it was not a man, but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few people who are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today: they demand honesty and a serious and private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their role model.
She divorced once, but was faithfully married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years afterwards, although she would have had many occasions to be unfaithful.
"Why should I eat hamburgers elsewhere when I have fried meat at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"None of his performances was as proud of him as the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a devoted philanthropist," he said.
The Olympic Games in Madrid
Indeed, many of us dream of having an Olympics in Madrid, and after the 2012 failed, it might be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really prepared?
Because if we're starting from yesterday's race, I don't think it's at all.
They called it a perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst of many I've ever been to.
It was characterized by a host of misunderstandings, and if it had to be evaluated once and I was the examiner, it would clearly be a failure.
Let's go first and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the numbering, which meant that we had to arrive earlier.
That’s not a problem in itself, but if you’re going sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid queuing later).
That's not what happened.
At first they gave me only the serial number (first nonsense, so go there sooner) and (after standing in the usual line) how surprisingly, it was just an S-shirt (second nonsense, because I'm exactly XL in size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save on material and buy only cheaper, small t-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the awful early time to pick up the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally did it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the waiting for more than 40 minutes even more pleasant, which was accompanied by attempts at popular uprising and stand-attacks.
I think by tomorrow, we're going to have about 500 cases of pneumonia, and some of us, myself included, aren't going to get our placement by the actual time, because I'm assuming that my chip recorded the start incorrectly.
If you ask me about the perfect race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft unveiled a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of – not very intelligent – artificial intelligence that, however, can perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle on the company’s territory) based on the information heard from the conversation.
With the help of a camera and a form and face recognition system, this “reception” can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are – and even remember what clothes they are wearing – and can hear and understand the keywords in their conversations.
In addition, you can group the attendees based on the conversations.
In the video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company that is talking to her, nor is she an employee of the company.
He asks if he has visited someone and assures him that he will come to his aid soon.
All this without the big blue screen.
That's amazing.
This, of course, is the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people have said that Microsoft has changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster -- bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented the whirlwind, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system and the software themselves are becoming increasingly overlooked.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google had taken the first step to becoming a competitor to Windows.
Many have rightly acknowledged that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to count on the "death" of the operating system, not in absolute terms, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to the web browser.
We turn on the computer only to open Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and spend more time browsing than we do in the world of windows.
What is the majority of the applications that come with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online and ultimately be an alternative to Google.
They need all of this, and I’ll give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month in a lounge for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
A poster on the soda machine tells them to use the company's browser, "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010, in fact.
Microsoft is likely to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, mobile phones are becoming more and more like computers.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azul, by Leonardo di Caprio in the Bloody Diamond of Edward Zwick, and by Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, and is also one of the basic costumes of the well-built gay audience.
And while we are talking about the specialties, we can also recall the peacetime figure of the travelling circus’s cuckoo moustache weightlifter.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than a man's -- typically tight and sleeveless -- cotton t-shirt.
That is, the "tank", as the Anglo-Saxons call it, but none of its rivals can compete with the le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First, because of his elegant name, although he is known among friends only as "Marcel", which is due to the sport, legend has it that it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel stands out among its competitors for its outstanding cotton fabric, unisex cut, unique logo and small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most characteristic models carry hidden in the neckline of the shirt.
But the Belgian company does not only make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen pants, navy t-shirts, baby clothes, minishorts - and more - are all among the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is also unfortunate that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is.”
He was very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Nowadays, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling is much more than just a few pretty, pretty girls giving her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as at the ceremony of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It brings warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present the new autumn-winter collection of Mango, designed by my brother Penélope. In addition, we participate in the announcement of the second competition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we took on a lot of things from there.
And then, often, I just go around the city and watch women dress up, change and choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite pastimes.
You're a dancer, an actress, a fashion designer, and you're a versatile woman, right?
I think so too, but after all, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
Even when I was little, I was interested in clothes, and I couldn’t wait to go to my grandmother’s house and look into my aunt’s wardrobes.
Now, that was you on Canaan, almost equal to an amusement park.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and rehearsals to have fun when we look in the mirror.
As an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
See, it's all connected, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you get lethargic?
Oh, no.
I'm feeling better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think that's when women are really mature, they've had enough experience and they make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been doing what I want to do, and that brings me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother, because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don’t want to miss that.
And as for the future father, it doesn't matter who it is.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movies, and last year, you've made a lot of movies that haven't even been shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started out in theatre, am very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I can’t wait to be introduced to The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Oh, no, that's not true.
I didn't go up the runway as a model.
I’ve known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she just invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own Women for a Better World organization. I chose two of her own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned, and the proceeds were donated to Naomi’s NGO.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much to be said about him, I know him, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your work.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do it too.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Relapsing drunk drivers will be forced to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving offences, the Ministry of the Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was drunk or did not blow into the device.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the aim of the project is to return to traffic, the driver will also have to take a repeat course on traffic education.
In addition to the General Public Prosecutor’s Office of Traffic Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Automotive Safety Institute Technology Foundation (FITSA) participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers arrested repeatedly for drunk driving are re-driven.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the connected system determines the level of alcohol in the inhaled air. If it is higher than the permissible level or if the driver has not blown into the appliance at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 U.S. study showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming criminal offences,
On the other hand, it is easier to implement, as the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require a constitutional amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in experimental mode in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which calls for the system to be installed in school buses on a French model.
Mexico in Closed Shoes
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force’s Asturian Prince’s Party aircraft landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal couple coming out of the plane using our hands as blinds.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prominent personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Duke and Duke couple were coming to the city for an official visit.
Well, then there's not gonna be an airport shuttle for a while, so she's from around here or something.
"No, sir, she's Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, I mean...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Princely Couple of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon made by 27 Marines to protect the dignitaries.
The Prince appears smiling in his sea-blue robe, followed by the Princess, with her long hair snapped by the wind, in restrained clothing, but not in the usual toenail-shoes—perhaps they warned Mexico City was under threat of a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, then enter the room where the official reception takes place.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are awaited by a reporter on Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
The most suitable place for a fashion award in the world is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest of today’s fashion designers is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to introduce the young talents of the fashion industry internationally.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first competition, Sandrina Fasoli, saw her own clothes at the Mango window under 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and was almost in tears of emotion.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has recently opened on 1,335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
Amidst the many events and thanks to Valentino for presiding the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango for the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness as a result of the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking ornaments of ELAH. She accompanied Valentine to the main table of his dinner with her son Luis, who was nearly two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, was entertaining the guests, and, like Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they were left without a suit, because they each gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own design pants and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During a night-time opera visit, Gaya Toledo became so enthused with her company in the ballet room that she slipped up to one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but she showed me some pictures of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Oliver Martinez, who would be two metres tall and riding a motorcycle, and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental in Paris, bringing his own sheets and towels, and telling him in advance that he would not ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
There are not 1,000, but 1,000 and one way to turn off chaotic and messy everyday life.
Another good news is that you can find them all in one book, which will arrive in the bookshops on September 30th to bring you peace of mind.
The clock rings almost agonizingly at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how fast-paced the world is making me live every day.
The office is called voltage, and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is a 21st Century Disease.
But there are neither one nor two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and overcome problems at work.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that they like the most and can adapt to their free moments.
The stress-relieving work is called the 1001 relaxation method, and the calmness from it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK publishing house to the bookshops.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
What’s more, it also comes with other ideas that can all help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it’s time to sit back in your armchair, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I’m not talking about those who wake up and tell the story of what happened to them that day, but about those who talk while they’re asleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've told a lot of them he spoke at night.
In terms of its frequency, it can be completely rhabdomyosodical (for example, it occurs only once in a high fever illness) or more regular (daily, weekly or monthly) and usually the child does not remember anything the next day.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single trigger.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night awakenings, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but this is not legal either.
As already mentioned, it can be a condition with a high fever, or even an accompanying condition of stress or increased excitement.
So far, it has been little studied.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, or consist of incoherent words or grunts, but in contrast, it can also take the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination may reveal if there is no underlying problem causing great anxiety and thus may offer a solution.
As already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon and consequently there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by some other treatable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things you can do, and here are a few preventive measures:
Make sure your child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose soothing toys and avoid watching more fear-inspiring or aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who are more nervous or have more difficulty relaxing will be taught some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If you start talking during sleep, try to stay calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and they will remember nothing the next day.
Useful Advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be useless because the child is unconscious, but it would get out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by severe anxiety several times, it is advisable to consult a specialist or to reveal what causes the child to have a high level of anxiety.
If he speaks clearly (this is the rarest case), do not start asking questions to learn anything from him.
It would be superfluous anyway, since during sleep he is not conscious enough to gather his thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and any possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it’s just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaeusern at last.
After a long deep glide, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new momentum and won again at home.
Although there was no big game, the yellow-black players were put in several positions, one of which they were able to use to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot to the goal was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball had just touched the top corner of the goal. Then Ilhaeusern came to the fore, and the shots followed one after the other: Fonderflick tried to defend a distant shot, then Hirn also tried to fly away from the goal.
On the other side, the players defended in a block in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in the shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on Dannemarie’s side. Immediately afterwards, the first goal was scored: after Diebold’s first shot, Marais from Ilhaeusern scored the ball with an excellent position and then passed it to the goal (53 min.).
However, the goalkeeper of the Illhausern did not enjoy the glory for long: he was forced to leave the pitch twelve minutes later, so his teammates had to continue the fight with a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble to the home team, which had just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defenses. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball came very close to the goal.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
A demonstration held by fishermen on Monday paralyzed the traffic in several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to initiate action against the rise in gasoline prices, as the oil price exceeded the average record of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, said the president will “negotiate with fishermen on ways to help companies regain competitiveness and make seafarers’ working conditions and wages safer.”
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic-sensitive demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, resulting in nearly 10 km of congestion.
The traffic at Quiberon's yacht port was also paralyzed, but the roads to Belle-île were not blocked.
On the Quiberon peninsula, roadblocks were laid.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination, and at dawn tyres and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel stores in the ports of Brest, while protests were also taking place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
In Sables d'Olonne, in the province of Vendée, for example, fishermen did not board ships, while in Le Havre, some twenty vessels hindered the traffic of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the département of Loire-Atlantique lifted the blockade of the massive Total oil refinery in Donges in the evening.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, decided to wait for a meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on the next steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to decide on Tuesday on its next move and participation in a planned meeting at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Some Breton fishermen, however, do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Commission, as the Commission did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues,” because “the fishermen refuse to give in to their demands” and “they refuse to travel to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that a boat would only be profitable if the price of diesel fell below <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to the actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its transport plans for 2008
Despite the crisis threatening the global economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, has plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, the company’s president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, said in a statement.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft with seats between 30 and 120.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, restored by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the <0x24>85 billion advance, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times reported.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance business, AIG would be divesting itself from most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to explore sales opportunities.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets that AIG plans to sell include International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
However, according to the newspaper, there is still no final decision on the sale.
AIG needs to get liquid assets quickly in order to repay the US government-approved <0x24>85 billion loan, taking the risk of losing up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders in proportion.
Paris Historical Study on the Morning Meeting’s Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank bailout plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which represents an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points) and the NASDAQ by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points, closing at 10,365.45 points.
The largest ever decline in the index (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.
Based mainly on tech papers, the Nasdaq dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 points, while the expanded index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was already weak when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bank bailout plan to restore the market balance, it began to plunge.
With 228 votes in favour and 205 in favour, MEPs declined to provide the funds requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
The plan was rejected by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
"The market has filtered out bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial analyst, said in a statement.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," he added, expressing concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be 'too late'.
"If the plan is really doomed to death, it will be the Fed and other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will continue to tighten," said Brian Bethune, senior economist at Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza added: "Every day in the past, new financial institutions go bankrupt" in the United States.
After Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy on Friday, authorities have ensured that Wachovia’s banking business is acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market “is not only an American crisis, but a global one,” adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has recovered significantly.
The yield of the 10-year government bond fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday night, and the yield of the 30-year bond fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama wins first television duel
The first debate between the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would win the duel.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaigners claimed victory in a television duel that was watched by one-third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, while John McCain’s performance was respectable, it was not “astonishing enough” to stop the decline in popularity, as evidenced by surveys conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to a poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%, respectively).
Among the most predictive, yet indecisive voters, 39% of those polled say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party partner Joseph Biden’s promising Thursday appearance, Biden’s first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
You have good feelings.”
McCain, who is in his seventies, never fails to put his own undisputedly vast foreign policy experience to the forefront, but underlines his opponent’s “naiveness” on these issues, which were at the heart of his first personal meeting.
“It seems that Senator Obama doesn’t understand...” the attack was repeated.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform that has been exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, however, insisted that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed; he spoke concisely and accurately.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does," a Democratic ad broadcast over the weekend accused the Republican leader of still not assessing the impact of the crisis on the American 'street people'.
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina in the rain.
The turbulent situation in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, whom the Americans consider to be the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could prove to be a turning point," said Senator Charles Schumer, an influential Democrat.
Democratic MP Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had “excellent economic instincts” like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment over the eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois Senator has reaffirmed that despite stock market volatility, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans, adding that his primary goals include achieving the country’s potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as developing a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates cautiously evaded questions about the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bank bailout plan: the extremely unpopular plan was approved by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk’s main square after the polling stations were closed to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: 'Mr. Dictator, resign!'
Some people admit that they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I go? They can do whatever they want with my vote anyway," says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to make itself look good to foreign observers in order to establish relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were judged clean, the sanctions against the country could be lifted, with 40 Belarusian leaders denied visas and some bank accounts frozen.
According to the opposition, the elections did not go smoothly.
"We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to take part in the ballot count," Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition, a group of twelve parties, said in a statement.
"The changes were only nominal," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive power.
If the opposition delegates get into parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to parliament allows them to have a seat on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit bills.
The opposition must therefore take part in political life, because “an initiative must be taken in dialogue with the European Union”.
If our economy, heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are unable to regenerate, we run the risk of falling under Russia’s control.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout seems too high and that the extensive organisation of the preliminary vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) allowed for any kind of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that elections were taking place here?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was the last person to be released from prison in August, where he was held as a political prisoner.
There was no abstention in the polling stations.
There will be no more than five opposition MPs in the parliament, namely the ones most suited to the leadership.
In October, the silence of the night returns.
And on television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are delighted.
Blood is safe again.
Hema-Quebec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday. President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Hema-Quebec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood donor societies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people’s trust, which was severely undermined by the blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply managed by the Red Cross Blood Service in Canada became infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, the Canadian government launched a formal investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, to clarify the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Judge Krever was delayed in submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Commission carried out this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports resulted in the establishment of two blood supply services in Canada: one for Héma-Quebec, which serves Quebec, and the other for all the other provinces and the two territories, the Canadian Blood Society.
"When Héma-Quebec started its operations in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system," says Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we have managed to regain people's trust." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population considered Héma-Quebec to be reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that “trust is an extremely fragile thing.”
Hema-Quebec has been applying the precautionary principle since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
During this period, many cases of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was transmitted through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we should apply exclusionary measures. In this case, we were talking about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes changes in the brain, and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was undoubtedly established that the disease was transmitted through blood.
This incident convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that makes it possible to diagnose HIV more sensitively. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect the virus itself directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies formed against the virus, on which the tests previously used were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with our technical tools, the expert explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk of blood donors unknowingly infecting the blood stock was significantly reduced and this could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million blood products until someone becomes infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such an event to occur and someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that anyone can now accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health, says the No. 1 leader of Hema-Quebec.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You never know what kind of new pathogen is entering the system.
After all, it was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood by a bite of an insect.
Therefore, we must be constantly on guard,” Dr. Décary continued, stressing that in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Quebec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“As the population ages, demands also increase.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population is also affecting the donor population, as the number of people in the network who are able to donate blood accounts for only 3% of the population of Quebec.
However, any healthy person aged at least 18 who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have visited a country that is plagued by malaria are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
“With this 3%, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we run out of supplies.
The number of blood donors, however, must be increased to the extent that the existing ones are getting older, because after a while they can no longer donate blood.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and persuade them to become regular blood donors.
“In today’s rushed world, one has barely an hour to go out and donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Héma-Quebec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are almost exclusively used in severely burned people.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed, and frozen, and placed at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public stem cell bank.
Only the umbilical cord, which was once treated as medical waste, can be used to extract blood that is rich in stem cells, and thus also to treat serious diseases (such as leukemia).
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the inclusion of the thousandth sample of cord blood in our bank, and we plan to collect more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering these for organ transplants,” said Dr. Décary, who said that the umbilical cord blood removal program is very popular nowadays.
“Many mothers are saddened that they don’t have the opportunity to do so,” he said, “because Hema-Quebec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the USL-1 qualifiers by 3:1 and reached the semi-finals with a total score of 4:3. This was the second quarter-final match and the most crucial match for the overall results, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half was without a goal, in the second half the two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found themselves in the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only one from the Sounders who managed to outplay goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Remember that on Friday's first match, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat from the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact plays in the semifinals with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder, who lost 3:1 to Whitecaps in the first game, won 4:3, but Whitecaps reached the semifinals with a 5:4 overall result.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens’ favorite trias are ready for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the three great attacks, and in the end the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers 3:2 penalty shots last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec scored two goals, and Kovalev scored a goal, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored only one shot.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warned.
“It takes one more game to really feel in shape.”
“He tried to get too much out of himself in the first trimester,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“But I think he was happy with the outcome of the game.
He got a huge ovation."
Charest 's
The Prime Minister does not rule out that elections will begin this year.
Just after the Liberal Party meeting had ended, Jean Charest travelled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is pursuing a victory in the interim elections to be held today.
"To push back our last great northern border": this is the ambitious long-term goal Jean Charest stated at yesterday's meeting of the Liberal Party in Lévis, Quebec. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the president tried to focus on the essence.
During the performance, behind his back, they projected sequences of images similar to "Moulin à images".
The three giant projectors were followed by stunning images: hydropower dams, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that elections would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" of the future of Quebec, embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the area beginning at the 49th parallel) was frequently featured in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
The head of state, however, merely explained why he considered the North to be a “treasure mine full of enormous potential”, but he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few potential developments: in particular, hydropower, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of catching-up countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
"Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds are located in the north," Chares said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", is "the territory of our territory, Quebec."
It is found not only in us, but also in us,” the head of state reiterated, stressing that he intends to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec's design work, James Bay...
"This is ours, our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break from looking at the huge map behind him.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed for itself, the Prime Minister said at a press conference.
“This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
“There is a line on which no agreement has been reached for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same position on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, “we also need to rethink our view of the North in the light of climate change,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage that opens every year as the polar ice melts.
In the Prime Minister’s opinion, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
And what about the indigenous peoples, the Indians and the Eskimo?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially to young people.
The two ministers of the different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was an delegate of the Parti Québécois in Ungava) have already begun consultations with some thirty local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role, has also started to work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision is created".
The development of the North would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, structured and at the same time environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as party president on Friday.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“Our couple’s politicians, including Hydro-Quebec’s founder Godbout, Lesage’s silent revolution and the nationwide expansion of hydroelectric power plants, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also cited another - true, conservative - work, namely "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the design of the dam for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, President Charest pointed out that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
"It's between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and a loud storm of applause responded to his statement.
The Prime Minister, who even said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this autumn, which is also allowed by the law.
He stressed, however, that his calendar is already full, as he took on responsibilities at the meeting of the federal council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without hesitation. Here it is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, however, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The Party Québécois leader, Paulina Marois, reintroduced the development policy for northern Québec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn't, "we would have gone much further today," said Ms Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who was nominated for the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The opposition party, ADQ, supports the government's approval of the Northern Plan.
"We would like this to be more than a play," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Vic Toews, Harper Cabinet minister (by the way, “Justice” minister), dared last summer to call Louise Arbour a “shame” for Canada.
To defame a woman who has fought without ceasing for justice and deserves all our admiration says a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which is not the only Western country that has returned its own citizens from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is the government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of.
It is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to suffer in inhumane conditions.
The only government that turns justice into a puppet theater while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also demanding the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to be given fair trial in Canada.
And our government turns a blind eye to the torture: it doesn’t matter to him that a young adult has already been spiritually ruined, and that many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
"Democracy": Harper continues to utter this word, which from his lips sounds like a mere empty word.
So the time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen at the discretion of a leader of a government that has been a minority until now (and what will happen after October 14th...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order; they do not see that this government tramples on the values that have given our country its good name and dignity.
My dear Mr. Toews, the shame is this -- you shouldn't look elsewhere.
Comments on: Barrick Gold Orwell’s Speech
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President and CEO of the Barrick Gold Mine in Canada, appeared in Le Devoir on September 17.
In Orwell's explanation, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a <0x24>6 million libel lawsuit against three authors and a low-money publishing company to initiate a so-called "public debate."
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in defamation lawsuits, are made not on the basis of the truth, but on the basis of the law.
It is not surprising that Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate is to destroy anyone who has a contrary position to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend significant sums of money on defense and combat in an unequal battle with an army of lawyers backed by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry on the other side.
In such an unequal struggle, the tactic is often used to destroy the defendant and to make a friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposite, but even intimidates those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, he should have expressed his views in public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is different, in Canada, the parties to the dispute usually do not stick each other up with sticks, but express their thoughts.
Therefore, the mine would have been enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, and publications, paying independent research groups that could shed light on the question.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to trust the public and sweeps away petitions and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada in one move.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he disregards the opinion of this public?
In the Deputy President’s mind, this word probably refers only to the well-paid lawyers, rather than to the entire population of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus narrowed down.
In a democratic state, even those who despise others have the right to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand, or does not want to understand, that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because they condemn the mill’s rude conduct.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a verdict, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a lawsuit aimed at silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate," Barrick Gold recently urged the authors of Noir Canada in writing to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver’s surrealistic explanations, Barrick Gold’s method openly attacks the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of any democratic society.
As a whole, the procedure denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, subjects that dislike the wealthy corporations of today can only be studied and discussed in litigation, who will dare to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have the right to answer.
In our university community, we have long been able to handle disputes, disagreements and conflicts.
Barrick Gold's reckless course of action shows that, contrary to what he claims, he has no desire to engage in an open debate.
This represents a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures that limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Action: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congressional, Republican and Democratic leaders have finally reached an agreement on an economic rescue operation, the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The <0x24>700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by MEPs; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized for non-payment at a level; and the right of access to the salaries of managers of companies receiving assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, U.S. House of Representatives President Nancy Pelosi and Republican MP Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
"We've made a big step forward towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets," said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
"We did everything to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis that is hitting Wall Street," he said.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in Americans' daily lives," Republican MP Judd Gregg said.
The negotiation was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investor sentiment.
They gave you a deadline for the deal until the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates, who joined the negotiations late, showed willingness to reach an agreement, but nevertheless expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that the situation had escalated to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed the extension of the agreement to elements such as provisions on the preservation of home ownership or the salary of executives of corporations assisted by the state.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps to deal with other people’s irresponsibility, it’s not very welcome.
These steps are necessary," he said on a U.S. television show.
When his opponent John McCain was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
“What I have read in broad terms shows that this is something that we all need to digest and by which we can move forward.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan is to use taxpayers’ money to buy the dubious claims of U.S. financial institutions and some risky, unsellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the burst of the real estate balloon, which first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt (commercial) securities, and finally to the freezing of liquid assets and the turmoil of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was rejected by a group of Republican MPs last week.
We seem to have gotten out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that some of the “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty should be secured by the government rather than purchased.
To ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, the plan includes a provision that if the government has to bear losses under the program for five years, it may impose new taxes to recover its funds.
As part of the new plan, a <0x24>250 billion instalment would be paid out first, followed by an additional <0x24>100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining <0x24>350 billion will have to be approved by Congress.
In return for the aid, Washington acquires a stake in the subsidized companies, through which it receives a dividend from the profits, which it can sell after the crisis has eased.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it will be able to set a maximum amount of wages and severance payments to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan want the plan to be approved by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
There have been repeated statements against the plan by both Republicans and Democrats.
“It’s absolutely clear that Washington won’t hear your voice,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s Finance Committee, told voters.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
There is nothing that benefits the taxpayer.”
Brad Sherman, the Democratic MP who leads the small congressional faction called the "skeptic faction," presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us asking Congress not to rush and to carefully examine which path to take,” Sherman said in a statement.
In Europe, at the same moment, they once again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up a competitor on the brink of bankruptcy after losing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million (<0x24>2.9 billion) as a result of the US secondary mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s top 20 banks and top 10 insurance companies.
“This is not a waste of money,” Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said.
"In return, we will gain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain.”
In the meantime, across the English Channel, the British government seems to be planning to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the total amount of ongoing loans to Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (<0x24>75.5 billion).
Spain’s Santander bank announced yesterday that it will acquire its subsidiaries and clients.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the crisis, after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the actor idol
His beautiful azure eyes were considered by some to be his main trump card, and others to be his main weakness.
Has the American actor ever got rid of his narcissistic mirror?
Yes, and no.
Due to his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far removed from the noisy style that is the essence of the true great monsters of the art world.
But what a great course he has run!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at the age of 83, one of the last icons of American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, who had long been a competitor on the screen; he was more modest and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often leads to extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He didn’t think too much about himself, which only increased his merit.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University, then at Actor's Studio in New York City, before exploding into the theatre, television, and cinema.
In addition to being a frontrunner of civil rights, he won second place in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979 as a racing driver. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know the shadows of the life of this mysterious, isolated, dedicated actor, who hated the glitter of show business, and this remains a mystery forever.
He was an honest man in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his big roles, we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his life’s work, the seventh American art, the cinema has been constantly changing for more than fifty years.
We remember the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in the Tennessee Williams adaptation of "The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
Recently (1990), he is remembered in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his old age, faces the fact that his marriage failed to fulfill his hopes.
Paul Newman has many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's "Someone Upstairs", he played the unforgettable role of the stormy-life criminal-boxer Rocky Graziano, a role originally intended for James Dean and taken over after his death, which started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant film The Big Crash, which won an Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
Robert Rossen played a bitter, revengeful billiard player in The Scam (1961) and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, for which he won an Oscar in 1987 for one of nine nominations.
Changed times, but always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by changes of epochs.
George Roy Hill's "Icebreakers" (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, the unconventional coach of an ice hockey team.
He was featured in the Coen Brothers' "The Big Leap" in 1994.
Sam Mendes' "The Way of Damnation" was the last film to appear as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood for its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier did not see it as a "live refutation of underplay" without any sense of humor: his play was too powerful.
However, the industry has not always been kind to handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time simply lost his roles in the film.
Still, he played less often young and successful characters: rather, he played characters living on the margins of society—nervous, alcoholic, malignant, or hopeless—whose drift and rebellion he was able to reproduce with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a really shy and sensitive man in his heart.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation of the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), he starred with his wife Joanne Woodward in a subtle portrait of a melancholy woman.
In the 1984 film "Harry and his Son", he commemorates his son, Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (who played with him in "The Big Crash" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, sadly, "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production, and criticism of Hollywood’s loose motives are blurred.
We often saw his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with quite a bad taste in the mouth, although at first he thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds of such sales were always transferred to the Foundation for Children with the Disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all the time.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote: “Your father has always been unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all else.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai’s account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other criminal offences, including document forgery, which have caused particularly significant damage in a criminal organisation.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the tender funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often proven by false invoices.
The state and local government funds – in total about 65 million forints – migrated partly into the Young Left’s pockets and partly into the pockets of some individuals.
The method also described by the investigative authority was that the tender funds obtained were collected on the basis of expense accounts that were not supported by actual performance, and the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
For these, the bill blocks were purchased in the market of Józsefváros, and the circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And the names of the companies for which invoice production would take place were decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidék boulevard, to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to look at pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was then modelled on the invoices to be submitted to applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of Budapest, among others.
Most of these were noted by István Lados and his partner András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports needed to receive the grants.
One of the targets of Lados' "study trip" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for the group of 90 people of the Komisz Pont Association.
However, according to the CEO, they would not have been able to enter the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the account for the Foundation for a Better Future, later called Together for the Third Millennium, issued in the summer of 2002 was filled with formal and substantive errors.
A badacsonytomaji pension had only three rooms, no more than ten people could sleep in it in one night, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative filling out of forms went too far even when they marked Pigal Kft., which is also a catering company, whose accounts – according to the information provided to the prosecution authority – did not include documents concerning the Better Future and the name of the Hopá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the head of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and presented him with invoices, he knew immediately that the documents were false.
"Our stamps were incorrectly marked with our business name and tax number."
He added that, besides the formal reasons, the fact that 100 people were accommodated according to the invoice was not correct either, since they have 11 rooms in total, which do not have that many seats.
In addition, the bill was also for catering, while their restaurant hasn't operated for a long time.
The zealous account makers did not follow up on the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked at only arranges trips abroad, so they stubbornly marked travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not in line with the company’s billing practice.
In addition, as revealed during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, even though travel activities to countries outside the European Union were exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Better Future, because the company’s services are not charged with the indicated VAT of 25 percent, but with VAT of 15 percent, in addition, the hotel’s employees only issued machine invoices, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the “exhibitors” ruined their accounts by designating a company’s road freight transport as an activity carried out – it was revealed through the prosecution procedure – which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
In addition, due to formal discrepancies - inadequate account format, not a real stamp - it also failed that the accounts for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Secure Point are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the bills.
For example, the forgers did not pay attention to the fact that the Nyíregyháza HIB Kft. was being liquidated at the time when the group of the Young City Association was eating there, which is why the liquidation commissioner of the company, as far as we know, denied that he had issued the paper.
They were consciously
Another group of account issuers are those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left – Young Socialists, the Chance Budapest Foundation has issued an invoice for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, persuaded the manager of Collab Kft. to issue the fictitious invoice.
Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlage, which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlasz Association and the Vöröspiny<0xC5><0x91> Association with invoices worth roughly five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither does the money move, because the invoices were cancelled afterwards, but the organizations have forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies that issue an invoice are those that can be linked to the accused.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was the delivery agent of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., which is based in Budapest, but is not located there.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
In the course of the investigation, Cubatov admitted that he issued an invoice to Atlas, Hoppa and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation on behalf of Kft.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the request of Iván Kubatov.
In fact, none of the companies worked, which the defendant said was due to the fact that they did not get a job.
At the request of his accused partner Zsolt Szente, who also prepared the documents for the founding of the company, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Zuschlag-related associations: Atlasz and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Cubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office said that 10 percent of the bills and the VAT on Cubatov were in the mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were produced for the competition of the Szígpont.
Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted a tender in January 2006 to the socialist party’s public benefit organization, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the funds were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to reveal this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found during the search of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei’s office at the education ministry.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor’s office, will probably report on the process of producing the invoices.
Interestingly enough, the primary defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to unveil everything.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in the interest of the Socialists to make a deal with him in return for the large part of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the blame.
By the way, he may have been offended today, as his requests to alleviate the conditions of his detention, i.e. to put him under house arrest, were constantly on deaf ears.
While perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater damage and do not compensate for it can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he does not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overspending: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to issue more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuro-economic foundations of this known – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been uncovered by neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to be defeated in a type of competition such as the eBay auction, so they tend to pay too high a price.
The research attempted to map the neurological pattern of this "play" by means of experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers took part in a lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction while examining the active brain areas of the subjects using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction, in which an essential element is the over-bidding of the other party, the subcortical complex called striatum became active intensively when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, among many other functions, plays a role in the “self-rewarding” mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price hike can be explained by avoiding a fierce reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research team also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they were out of the game, they would be rewarded with another <0x24>15.
The third group, on the other hand, received <0x24>15 just before the auction, but members of the group lost that money in the event of a losing auction.
The only difference between the two groups was that they emphasized winning for one and losing for the other.
However, proving the neurologists’ hypothesis, members of the team playing against “loss” were willing to bet higher than the control and “winning” groups.
"These findings cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
Until now, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of winning and risk avoidance.
“Only neuroimaging techniques have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, and we have now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to Seek a Doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected with hepatitis in Hungary is estimated at 100,000, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is a common term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, characterized by hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (for example, infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travelers should be vaccinated against the A and B viruses, but there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After this, jaundice on the skin and the whites of the eyes develops, the stools are light, the urine turns dark, healing can take up to two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die each year from the most serious form of the disease, hepatitis B liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receives medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
In three groups, there are far more than average cases of these diseases: people who had undergone blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
There are currently 200 million people infected with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult a general practitioner if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
By recognizing the disease in time, the virus can be cured and eliminated from the body, thus eliminating infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its purpose is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a painkiller that may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to study how faith in God affects people’s perception of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and the same number of atheists were subjected to electroshock while each was studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Thanks to technology scanning the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a series of research involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparking device to the subject’s left hand, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked participants to look strongly at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the Lady with Hermelin painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state among believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a soothing effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive episodes while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics reported that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as they were “cared for” and “silent, peace filled them.”
While viewing the religious-themed picture, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who participated in the study himself, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even for atheists, just find the right photo.
"We should find a picture of someone they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
“Exercising faith should, and in many cases will, change our personality,” Wright said.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber is shown a picture of a madonna to believers, what effect would that have on their pain control?
Would the sight of the quality of the Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can tell you: it’s in people’s pockets as much as it is in the sky above their heads; he knows where they’ve been on vacation, what special orders they’re going to and what they’re interested in.
That’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s top men.
However, when it comes to skeptics paralleling the Orwellian horror, they do not see the very essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal information about its users, which is necessary to keep up with the original goal of Google’s founders: “Let’s get all the information in the world.”
According to Google, the company is still at the beginning of managing all of the information after 10 years of world-subversive work.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to know how to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what would I really do?”—but until then, software can’t answer the seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search terms are accurately recorded when searching on the Internet, from which IP address they were searched for and to which page they went after the search.
Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own surfing history, look back at what they’ve been looking for, what they’ve clicked on, for example, and in the long run generates more personalized results for them – the same logic that Recommendations uses to offer products and services based on our previously mentioned and fixed preferences.
What if my data is used against me if they look at what I do," users who are worried about Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the feeling of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even the rebellion against power, is what triggers the counter-reactions among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be passed on to a third party, in such cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected by anything.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about the paedophiles on its own social networking site, Orkut.
Internet users concerned about privacy may have sighed back in May when the company, together with the EFF electronic rights organization, successfully proved its case in court against the FBI, saying that Google could not be forced to disclose any information secretly requested by the FBI in any future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms obtained in reference to the ratification of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but it failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and a complete two-month list of website and keywords.)
“Google’s perception is quite contradictory: it is being whipped by those who fear disclosing their personal data because they feel their intimacy and privacy is being compromised by the fact that they start using Google’s services and act against them with the riots that multi-company companies with a conservative image deserve.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists, and users in many countries sees them as the next generation of major corporations, the "cool corporation", unlike Microsoft, a world conqueror for Windows, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google doesn’t ask its users for an identification code, doesn’t ask for money for its applications, and open, free, constantly updated source code and packages seem much more accessible, youthful, cooler than the official software giant’s practice.
However, it can also happen because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy rights and the Internet, which has been brought about by one of the most popular keywords of recent years, Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving tracks and taking advantage of the communication channels available to us, and while the extent of these varies from person to person, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can manage a profile on multiple social networks from Facebook to Xanga, link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing their music habits, and then link them all to tracking systems such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm, or host a blog that automatically displays their latest photo galleries in Flicks.
While there are many exemplary cases out of which it comes to light: a girlfriend can easily find out by seeing the morning photo stream of a common circle of friends that a fraudulent friend has spent the evening with, or she can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion about top management in her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
Those who live online are made up of what they show themselves, so that we can formulate the basic theorem behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least try to circumvent the Google monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google’s search engine but deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, the number of people who do not intentionally register on social networks to prevent them from being found can replace Google’s online apps, from word processors to image processors and newsreaders, with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and that do not create the best profile we have ever had.
The general public doesn’t expect Google to show off its teeth.
With a current value of <0x24>156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten advertising agencies’ revenues, and the increasingly fast-paced introduction of services is a major headache not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, find counterpoints to these concerns: the top management, for example, completely rejected employee protests after doubling the company’s kindergarten fee, found the company’s interest in China to be too expensive, and the company’s interest in making any number of daily meals for employees, according to the terms of the agreement, which violates the company’s arbitrarily many times a day, but all of this is dwarfed by the fact that Google still pushed its head in 2006.
One of the company’s internal rules is that they don’t advertise a new service in advance until it’s ready for use, but it’s clear that the foreseeable problems of the months and years to come could move the world at a new point: while some people believe that we can build a health system with our own, Google’s entire project of scanning and archiving books and magazines is of such size that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court of Health.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can be a good source for the next generation of science fiction writers, according to the popular Cory Doctorow short story Scroogled with Orwellian overtones, a future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly well from Google’s data.
Two juveniles helped the double killer in Ozd to distract
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, and they were suspected to have helped cover up the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the charge and are currently accused of complicity.
The two minors – according to MTI information – two girls are defending themselves.
Criminal complicity can be punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
A 23-year-old local man, suspected of double murder in Ozd, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of committing multiple homicide on a premeditated, profit-seeking basis.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to an establishment in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then the man’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI’s information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, a sign of this is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon at the scene.
The gun and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the assistance of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million - some five billion Czech kroons - to buy the Prague Stock Exchange's 100 percent share package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles in spite of the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
The Polish state holds 99 percent of the shares and plans to sell more than 60 percent of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 is new to know that the Polish bid represents the highest amount that has been offered so far by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have submitted bids so far.
Last week, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the extinction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion kroons.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The Financial Crisis from the Perspective of European Newspapers
The leading European newspapers in their commentary on Tuesday, dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis, already mention "September 11th".
The global financial disaster is due to the US President, La Repubblica in Rome accused, who has not even been able to line up his own party behind a swiftly concocted bill aimed at redressing the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, which billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11.
Some of the Madrid press see the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will then suffer.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, the congressional vote threatens that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states can provide a lifeline to the backing financial institutions and use taxpayers’ money to save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like domino cubes, neither the funds nor any further improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, the Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was given to sick financial institutions, the Vienna Standard recalls, saying concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, need to reach deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis are becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'savers' do not have to blow up hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if it were stated: in which case it makes sense to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
Smart Car Imitates the Flying of the Bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop collision avoidance technologies, if not by imitating obstacle detectors that occur in the natural world?
Bees, for example.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C, a bio-imitation car robot control system, a robotized minicar with bee-like qualities, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that eliminates all collisions.
While flying, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective shell, said Kazuhhiro Doi, technology PR and R&D brand manager at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the complex eye of the uterus, which can see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate the complex function of the eye, the engineers used the idea of laser telemetry.
It identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 metres in a 180-degree field of vision before the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is instantly transformed into a collision avoidance operation.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and the robot immediately changes its direction, imitating the movements of the uterus, by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, the car-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
You need to react in an intuitive and immediate way, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shell, a layer within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility for bees to bypass other bees, only rotational motion and acceleration and slowing down were used as an option available to the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, much less the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and respond with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you will constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be available for mass-produced cars in 10 years.
A further application option is to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It's called the poison-dear kid.
A written version of the <0x24>700 billion bailout bill to buy bad loans from banks has been prepared.
Half of the money will be spent in the first round.
During talks after midnight east coast time on Saturday, congress leaders came to a conclusion in the <0x24>700 billion bailout dispute that has been going on for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” Nancy Pelosi, the U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said in a statement.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Treasury Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will work and be effective, but there is still work to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets at 8:00 p.m. on Sunday (i.e. 2 p.m. CET), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft law, which is called the Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act of 2008, and the Senate will then be the seat of the House.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend <0x24>700 billion on low-quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, for the first time, a maximum of half of the <0x24>700 billion can be spent, with <0x24>250 billion being used immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, of which the Treasury Department will buy loan-backed, poorly rated securities, and the fate of another <0x24>100 billion will depend on the president’s decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will participate.
The other half of the 700 billion will depend on a new resolution by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly, the Ministry’s officials said.
The legislation will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the finance ministry guarantees worrying assets for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it is to buy bad assets on a large scale, to insure them, or to avoid the systemic risk of the collapse of a major financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
But the bosses of banks in distress and waiting for government help can expect their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, to be limited by the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, in addition, the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys through an auction, an additional tax will be levied on the gold parachute unless the levitated bank manager is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that managerial funds are not exaggerated.
The picture also shows that the existing gold parachute contracts remain unchanged and the restriction applies only to the new ones, in order to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, in the participating banks, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can ultimately win the transaction once the economy and, with it, the rescued bank recover.
In the next five years, the president will have to submit a bill to Congress that provides for how to return expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, there were people on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what the American people asked us to do, that is, it doesn’t protect the taxpayer’s dollars, Republican MP Darrell Issa said.
Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the actions were urged by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007, the HCSO reports.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and fell by 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only marginally, by 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices of manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to the 4.6 percent and 2.5 percent monthly increases in the price of bags and belts, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
Prices fell in the oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery and instrument manufacturing (0.9 percent) and, to a minimum, in the wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, the price increase was between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which holds a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry, increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the protracted effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4%) in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing sectors.
In the manufacturing of metalworking products, the price increase was 13.2 per cent, and in the manufacturing of food, beverage and tobacco, which represents the dominant weight, 11 per cent.
The fall in prices occurred in the manufacture of textiles and textile goods (2.5 per cent) and in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In other manufacturing sectors, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
Among the intended groups of sectors, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, and in the sectors producing energy and re-use prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the biggest price increase was observed in energy- and secondary-use sectors (16.8 per cent) compared to the same month of the previous year.
We measured a 6.8 per cent price increase in the consumer goods sectors and a 1.4 per cent decrease in the price of capital goods.
The export sales prices of the industry, measured in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
Our domestic currency weakened in one month by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro and 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, and by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa for the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force around 12 January – the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In his opinion, "now almost everything depends only on the timely implementation of the electronic access control and control system overseas".
At the same time, he pointed out that there will be no travel authorisation in the new system, but tourists will have to register before they leave.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will hold talks in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will hand over the honour with the Star, and will hold discussions with foreign policy advisers from the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support the bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, both expressed their support for the government's <0x24>700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After several days of marathon talks, Congress and administration officials announced on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to defuse the frozen credit market have become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain claim that they are better equipped than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, melting McCain’s advantage after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin nominating him for vice president.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the 700-billion-dollar bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection pass-throughs that he supported.
"We have to act now, with responsibility (...) your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time swallowing this, but doing nothing is simply not a viable way.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the setting up of a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the severance pay of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
The German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp has voters become more self-aware – this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers, analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these very modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process ended, which was almost exactly ten years ago likely: the undisputed hegemony of a state party was ended.
In 1998, the CSU dropped to 47.7%, for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the CSU’s consistent modernization of the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU, secularization, educational achievements, and the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the voters have become more self-aware, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks the classical bourgeois groups have moved away most from the CSU; liberals, craftsmen, high school graduates and graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper’s article “Who, with whom? The party presidents on the coalition issues of the restrained” deals with the confused domestic political situation after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP bans the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to negotiate a coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders barely gave them a clue into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96>-President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - it exists in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current <0xC3><0x96>VP president as vice-chancellor - Faymann left open.
The Schüssel-Molterer course, he said, was rejected.
There is no question of repeating this direction.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party elects the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party for the time being, issues must necessarily be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President Jörg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> has once again shown his openness in all directions.
“To prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities for All began today in Paris and was hosted by France, which represents the EU presidency this year.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz representative of the European People’s Party, called attention to educational segregation in her message to the Plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, it is the most serious obstacle to their success.
The High Level Conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the Fidesz MEP’s press office, warned that apart from the discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma young people do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor basic education, only a minor part of them can obtain a higher education."
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections to the widest extent possible - also between Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; through taxes on income and consumption, they contribute to the national budget.
"Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education through the right of their EU citizenship, and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education must be guaranteed," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the goal and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary to speed up the de-segregation processes in schools immediately, for which the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunities of democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka said.
As part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year’s meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination set at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a temporary period
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the decommissioned Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the ugly election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and at the summits of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber and Günther Beckstein, the prime minister of the province, remain in place, the question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the 17 percent disastrous loss of votes will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized pair felt that they were not clinging to their chairs with all their strength.
In doing so, they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, one day after the "bajor tsunami", demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, the Christian Social Union, led by Edmund Stoiber at its peak, gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has reached only 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "single ruler" of Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
While conservatives continue to count high in the southern province, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced into a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the rearrangement within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, the possible successor of Huber, will also be in the narrow reconnaissance team that is starting negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Electorate along the lines of right-wing values on a possible government coalition in Munich.
It is a strange delusion of fate that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a coup d’état option, is on the list of Free Elections and was brutally treated by the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been twisting the threads in the background, will also play an active role in the transition, calling September 28 the bitterest day in the political career of the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president.
Huber made some bile comments to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel will not be a chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success of 2005, is somehow put on a joint footing.
Merkel, who has found it difficult to conceal her disappointment with the fiasco, said the loss of CSU soil would not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
What is relative, of course: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will last longer.
The SPD achieved the weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 with 18.6%.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110-0
None of the opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country under Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it can be explained by illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the country of 10 million people has been without opposition for a decade, the opposition united before yesterday’s elections called the United Democratic Forces (UDF) had earnest hopes that the constitutional amendment would lead to Lukashenko renewing his presidential mandate for the fourth time in 2006.
The ODSZ also abandoned the pre-considered boycott.
Against the background of the opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which has taken credit for reducing Russian gas imports, which are constantly rising, and has also contributed to the Russian handover of Beltranszgaz, who owns gas pipelines passing through the country – wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where the non-democratic Lukasko has been classified as a Belarusian.
The OSCE’s assessment of the election campaign focused on positive moves rather than on shortcomings, such as banning one-third of the opposition candidates from running.
The OSCE’s quick report on Monday, however, also objected to the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition believes that there is a significant improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is also willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, refusing to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have separated from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich said.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it was desirable that this should remain the case, despite the fact that "the power is afraid of allowing even an opposition member to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest actions in the light of the results, but rather trying to convey its message to the electorate about the need for economic reforms.
“Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, local authorities are creating obstacles to the dissemination, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko’s regime, which sees the creation of adequate social security as its main achievement, is not even the most officially supported pensioners.
“Due to the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time before social security is broken, which evokes the “silence of the cemetery”, Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers denounced the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, the head of the CIS mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti, “people believe not in words but in deeds”, so the absence of opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
Uniquely in the history of the Chigi Palace, rotary doors have been installed to allow workers to enter and out of the building.
From today onwards, this new measure will be in place against the tricksters, to filter out those who block and then go out to have a cup of coffee during working hours.
Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister’s Office, unveiled the news today.
"The swivel gates," Brunetta said, "are designed to work better and more efficiently, reduce absenteeism and increase services."
“There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the Council of Ministers’ buildings.
According to Masi, “the installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
We saw no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In short, breakfast is over during working hours, no more coffee and brioches.
Brunetta smilingly advises: “A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. can do wonders.”
the College of Public Administration of Rome
At the meeting, the minister explained: “in three months, absenteeism in the public sector due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which means sixty thousand more people working in a year.”
He added that the Italian government should be made more efficient.
"whose wage dynamics, according to the minister, have been twice as high as those of the private sector in the last 8 to 10 years and well above the inflation rate," he said.
At the same time, thousands of public servants gathered to join a petition supported by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the Brunetta Regulation.
“While the Minister of Public Administration boasts of data supporting the reduction of absenteeism due to the disease, the number of ‘ tireless scoundrels’ continues to grow,” the Consumer Protection Association wrote.
Thousands of honest and hard-working officials across Italy have assembled to declare war on the illegal provisions of the decree.”
The regional administrative court is challenged, inter alia, against the abolition of supplementary sickness allowance due to illness due to service reasons, the extension of the period of stay at home for workers on sick leave, which means the period during which the patient visitor may appear, and several other aspects provided for in the new provisions prescribed by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
In Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work every day, with 3 deaths and 27 resulting in permanent disability.
According to the occupational accident insurance company, there were nearly 1,200 deaths at the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and which kills almost twice as many people as killings.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is organizing the Day of Victims of Workplace Accidents, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October in every county of Italy, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the mass media to this dramatic problem.
"The alarming data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm that prevention plays an extremely important role in workplace accidents," said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association for Disabled Persons in Accidents at Work.
The head of state sincerely praised the association’s “persevering commitment to preventing accidents at work, protecting the interests of workers affected by accidents, helping the families of the victims and making the public more sensitive.”
“It is natural and frankly shared by everyone that these kinds of tragedies, which have aroused media and public interest in terms of their size, are provoked by outrage, but in reality we are faced with dramatic and repeated incidents every day.”
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly struggling with a shortage of resources, and funding for education and information is crucial.
Intra-school initiatives aimed at direct education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to let the social importance of the issue diminish, and we need more effective legislation, which must be enforced.
The House of Commons’ chairman, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed “the serious social significance of fatal accidents at work, which we all have in our consciences, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible.”
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still amazingly high," Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli said in a statement.
“We don’t want this declining trend to be coupled with declining attention, because it’s when the attention goes down that the greatest tragedies happen.”
"On a general level, we believe that we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex programme of action.
In our opinion, we would need stricter supervision and control, he stressed, as well as stronger intervention in the field of workforce training, starting with school education.”
"We also need to make further efforts to inform and make the public more receptive," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment to deal with a phenomenon that is a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and the "trend of aid towards which the system has been drifting in recent years".
“The aim is therefore to restore the safety of workers by insurance, because the fate of the victims of an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary and distributive measures of the legislators.”
MP3 Players May Cause Hearing Loss
Listening to portable playback devices such as MP3 devices for prolonged periods of time and at high volume may cause permanent hearing loss.
The European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), has published a report on this issue today.
"The study shows that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player for more than one hour a day for five years can have permanent hearing loss," the study said.
"It's worrying that young people who massively and frequently use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing," Kuneva said.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undeniable risk that we urgently need to respond to," the EU Commissioner said.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information widely.
In the light of this advice, we must also review existing control systems to ensure that they are effective and keep up with the latest technologies."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to explore possible measures to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," said the committee member.
The current European safety standard specifies a maximum noise level of 100 dB for portable music players, but growing concern is accompanied by data on hearing loss due to excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution that can significantly reduce these hearing losses.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for users of portable music players who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise pollution exceeds the current maximum level for noise at work.
If a person listens to music for a long time under similar conditions, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects around 5-10% of users of portable devices, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs until March, and results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the operation of the “Future of the Cathedral Capital of Rome” committee, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the spas of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work on Rome’s guidelines.
Following the March closing speech, the study and the plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Municipality Committee, so that in June the City’s strategic plan, officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted.
“This is a completely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented,” Alemanno stressed, “and it is their job to develop proposals for Rome’s development ideas on which political decision-makers, i.e. the Assembly and the Local Government Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where big plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after completing his duties, the committee will be dissolved because it has a temporary mandate.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the committee “The Future of the capital of Rome”, the Mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work superfluous, claiming that its opinion is not binding, Alemanno says: "It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the standards prove to be adequate, as in France with the Attal Commission, which I am sure will be the case with Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in dealing with day-to-day affairs and in dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we are looking further ahead, planning for the longer term, and committed to working for the development and future of Rome.”
The mayor of Rome would like to state that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'waterhead', because it is completely free, will cost no euro to the citizens of Rome, but will serve as an inspiration and aim to involve the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that enables our city to make the leap of quality that it needs so much, thinking in a united spirit about its future.”
As regards the future, which the mayor of Rome stresses, "it will not only be limited to the current framework of self-government, but will look far beyond", we see in it not only the future metropolis and the status of a capital, but also "the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician who claims to be independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
Jimmy Carter was the first to destroy the U.S. economy with his decisions and to maintain close ties (as a private individual does today) with hostile Islam.
As the elections approach, the attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama presumptuously believes he can win the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far had two governors and five senators who are black.”
These attacks are, in fact, nonsensical; of course, they are racist in nature, but they do not answer the voters' question of whether or not he will be a good president.
In this case, too, there are those who listen to their emotions and not their intellect.
In the interior of the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in an editorial: “We know very well that in the polling booth the true American patriot is casting his vote for whom.”
A side of the American way of thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just say what you want, and we'll know where to put the iks on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
In spite of all these arguments, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what mistakes were made during Bush’s term of office? 89% said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was knocked to the bottom by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans did not have to pack.
Iraq was Bush’s weak point.
A huge task awaits the replacement of George W.
USA: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time for austerity in the editorial offices has come. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the print media.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists about their views on the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly state that their concerns about credibility had been reduced.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions imposed on newsrooms, i.e. editorial offices that produce newspapers.
If we do not want traditional journalism to shrink to a minimum in the sense that the public understands it, this problem must be solved, the journalists interviewed say.
Nowadays, American journalism is characterized by a visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in the print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65% of journalists hold senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
Press staff have no difficulty in seeing where the web is headed.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the "murderer" of the print media.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they voted for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the U.S. press, there is a gap between the editorial directors, i.e., the directors, and the correspondents who work for them.
At the national level, 56% of executives are confident that their correspondents share their information with others, while at the local level, the figure is only 23%.
Some associate this with a secure job.
At the national level, 47% of managers fear that they will lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, that is 30%.
In America, the issue of "secure work" is constantly on the agenda at the team level (in the case of our editors, editors).
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
With a huge nation like the United States of 300 million people, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a “must or not must” basis.
Directors usually receive a high salary, and editors can earn up to <0x24>10,000 a month, in addition to their pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third also, until it reaches a maximum of 15 days after a certain period of time.
But American journalists, according to their own admissions, often “get sick” during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME: DANILO COPPOLA IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Justice of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, a real estate professional, who wanted to move from his place of residence, Grottaferrata, to a flat in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into the Unipol-BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings brought against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to a ban on leaving Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate specialist be allowed to visit his apartment in the capital from the small rural town.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor has made a negative proposal) would allow the company to influence its cases and have access to the evidence brought against it.
The Elite in Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the <0x24>700 billion rescue package proposed by the White House: a large part of the American public was more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is corroborated by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has led to a break within the Republican Party, which is showing a growing division between the traditional, restrained approach to the East Coast that supports federal institutions and business circles and the growing new trend in the central and southern states that is anti-Washington and anti-financial world.
This direction was critically expressed in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the ongoing economic transformation is predicting or predicting, not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and perhaps even beyond.
The crisis, both in the US and in Europe, seems to only accelerate the long-standing phenomena that are consolidating in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-update, the return to public awareness of the dual category of state sovereignty, in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects those banking and financial institutions that, although they have close ties with foreign countries, primarily, and on a fairly broad basis, attract people and families who live in a single country, a single state.
This, on the other hand, presents a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are, by the way, also voters.
Thus, although the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially stranded: the European Union is a fine example of this, which is unable to establish a unified political direction between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects intervention from the individual national governments, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but most of all the opening up of funds: because in times of need, only the individual states have economic resources, financial resources that can make things right.
They have the tools and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that are unlikely to be available to any other market or international organisation to such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nation-statehood is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future was increasingly dependent on non-abstract things like water, crops, and oil.
From things that can be transported from one half of the planet to the other, yet they can be connected entirely to a demarcated place, to an area.
Thus, the one who controls the area has far more trump cards than the one who was unfortunately born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
This brings me to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of breaking line.
Whoever says territory, state, government, must also say politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis appears to be producing two mutually compatible phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can handle events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, who have proved to be completely incompetent and have proved that many of the areas ahead of them are still blurred, is a total loss of credit.
Together, the two are of even deeper significance and in a certain sense more disturbing: the feeling of loss of credibility, impatience, incompetence and separation that affects the entire leadership elite in an increasing number of Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that there is a growing belief among the population that the time of the social elite, which has hitherto reached its peak, has passed before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, have been adopted. This is increasingly alienating the social elite from the opinion of the majority.
In a word, the demand for leadership, in a veiled form, is fueling a wide-ranging but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is perhaps manifested in the unanticipated “revolts” of voters against the Italians, or in recent times the sudden changes in public sentiment against the Americans. For example, the rise of the Conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the work
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, its programs and even it could be said that, along with its habits, its press and its renowned intellectuals, it is less and less able to represent what has been going on for some time in the deeper spheres of Western society.
In spite of all this, to speak frankly of “an imminent revolt of the masses” would be exaggerated.
But to keep your eyes open is not bad at all.
We can walk on the wall with super strong glue
Use a super-strong glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several US research centers, and a team of four institutions is close to solving the problem.
With a piece of glue measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to glue and hold a 100-pound body against a vertical wall.
The study, published in the American journal Science, published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists was born from the development of special materials with carbon nanotube structures that already exist.
"The glue's working principle should be imagined as a package of spaghetti-like pipeline systems," says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the gecko’s microscopic folded leg, which gives the animal a perfect grip.
Tests with materials such as glass, teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of these reptiles, but at the same time "it detachs easily from the walls," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe we can walk the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe we can, but the researchers are thinking of a less compelling use, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good at conducting heat and electricity.
You can also find additional applications in the field of space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists have shown a hair-like microfiber adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning when moving on the surface, so it always provides perfect grip.
Medications? Fruit juice is forbidden!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin drinks, which are popular especially in the summer, when they enter the body together with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, thereby increasing or reducing their effect, depending on the case. This can have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, said at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, preventing their beneficial effects and putting them at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already on the bench of the defendants when it was revealed that it was able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rate control and neuropharmaceuticals to levels considered toxic.
RISK MEDICINES - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in an official journal, warning doctors and patients to take the risks of this concomitant consumption seriously and to watch what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam and Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
A long list of active substances that are inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, a professor at the Department of Pharmacy at Milan State University, said: “Such findings are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes who, if necessary, will ensure that the information on the particular drug is changed.
That’s why you should always read the information on the medicine you’re taking, and if something’s not clear, don’t let it influence you, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly.”
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of the territorial relationships between commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman is a professor at Princeton University and a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for U.S. history than the collapse of the twin towers.
This prediction has sparked some debate, it has been repeatedly blamed by the economist, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and a little shocked, how quickly the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom was overcome by public interest," Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “very valuable economist,” but at the same time he spreads his criticisms of the Bush administration’s excessive liberalism in a rather “aggressive manner.”
Open Office, the third edition of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open-source personal productivity suite that targets a wide range of people, from home to office users, from freelancers to administration, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers, the new Open Office comes with a number of new features: in addition to its new welcome screen and redesigned, less Spartan user interface, it also offers a number of important new formats, such as compatibility with Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO Standard ODF (Open Document 1.2).
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so that Open Office can also open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting is the specific feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphics module while maintaining the page layout.
On the same interface, you can also create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or word processing elements.
In-app sharing has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet supports sharing workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other’s work. Each colleague’s post is marked in a different color, which helps to make it easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working on making some of OpenOffice’s features available on the cloud, so the final version is likely to be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been on the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The suite is available for Linux in addition to the standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
Upon request, we can collect the installation CD at home or at work.
Freeness is probably the biggest attraction in terms of the spread of home applications, but the Open Office suite is now trying to get in the business sector as well, as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of educational, consultancy and service services that are ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business horizons.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a Word-compliant word processor; Calc, a spreadsheet designed to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, the most well-known, similar to the Access database manager; and finally Draw, the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but if you consider that with the release of the new version, we are already at 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
During the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl from Austria, who competed for the team Gerolsteiner, again showed a positive pattern and won the bronze medal as well as the best mountaineering jersey.
The news came out on the website of the newspaper Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver, after Italian Riccardo Riccio and Leonardo Piepol, and German Gerolsteiner driver Stefan Schumacher, who gave a positive result in the Cera test, considered the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood samples, similar to the tests carried out in the last few weeks, were examined by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests confirm a positive Cera result, the Austrian loses his third place and is banned from racing for two years.
The news of Kohl’s positive third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and reported to the Associated Press that he reported a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to get on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, and also won the best dotted shirt for mountaineering.
NEW YORK TIMES ASKS THE QUESTION, ITALY'S RASSIST?
Italy has only recently become a popular destination for reluctantly accepted immigrants.
This is the question posed by the New York Times, which, based on the case of young Burkina Faso-based Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case illustrates what the New York Times called the "northern paradox": in the northern regions, "the strongest is integration and the highest employment" while "anti-immigration and support for the Northern League" is also the strongest in the country.
In support of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NOW also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins on immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, were also discussed as examples of a mood change in Italy.
Both the Pope and the President of the Republic highlighted this trend: “Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church should work together to defeat racism.”
Students suffer from expensive rents, it can cost up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 per room
The housing market for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Union of Homeowners, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples and 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such an astonishing scale that, due to the enormous total cost to families, it is excluding a wide range of students from the opportunity to study," explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that there has been a general upheaval against local residents."
In the majority of cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rent limit, with connected rent.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed that would allow for price capping through a review of the tax system.
According to the survey, the cost of a single room in Milan’s Brianza area ranges from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 (around Bande Nere) to an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 (around Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a bed cost 250/280 euros for doubles and 370-500 euros for singles.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are charged for a single bed and 450 euros for a double bed.
Slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburban districts, you can save some: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, the price for a bed is 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The price range is highest around Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
A bed in Bari costs 250/350 euros and a single room costs at least 350 euros.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are also frequently looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, the time of old cinemas in the cities has run out
Traditional cinemas are closing in favor of the multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.”
The pictures, created by director Giuseppe Tornatore, are an impressive representation of what is happening in the Italian metropolitan areas, but also in rural areas.
The displacement of cinemas - the emergence of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and, consequently, the atrophy of single-room cinemas in the city centers - is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time carries all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like going away with a friend, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which twenty years ago won an Oscar and a grand prize at the Cannes Festival, perhaps after the lost of Tornatore, all tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, a yearning.
The data provided by the largest association of operators, Anec, is clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna leads, losing 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41) .
And that the proliferation of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance is no better proof than the fact that these three regions of Italy have the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas: in the last five years, the number of rooms in Lombardy has increased by 195, in Tuscany by 81 and in Emilia-Romagna by the same amount.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec president Paolo Protti. "It's okay to build new facilities, but the survival of the existing ones should also be ensured, because when an urban cinema closes, not everyone who goes there is willing to go into multiplexes.
Not to mention the unreserved funds to support operators: the state’s overdue debt is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It is a disgrace, both ethically and morally, that the government does not abide by the laws in force.
It would require between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year to maintain the market.”
The case of Bologna deserves special attention: it is the first Italian city to have decided to address the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and boost the one-room cinemas in the outer and downtown areas.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators, as well as benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can enter restricted areas and park at a reduced rate in certain parking areas.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, including other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that conventional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the rule of multiplexes, need to improve the sound and image quality, because the audience today is much more demanding.
Preserving traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and adolescence, gave me the spark that made me finally make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I walk the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so as not to see the posters blackened by dust, I turn my head.
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioia Tauro arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromali clan in municipal decisions."
Serious charges have been made against Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, mayors and vice mayors of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, and Carlo Martelli, mayor of Rosarno, who were arrested this morning on charges of outside involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and his nephew, a lawyer of the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like criminal conspiracy, were also handcuffed and paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in damages.
"Ignorance of all legal and moral rules, and even good taste," state prosecutors write. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay a counseling fee to Piromali.
"Then the clan would have officially had access to the town hall, which would have given it additional control and direction of the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the Calabrian region, does not hide that there are “numerous collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld” in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean."
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events in July, when police announced that they had succeeded in decapitating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their responsibility to administer the municipality. The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was dissolved once in 1991, even then due to alleged mergers between organized crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian-Democratic mayor who ruled at the time of the dissolution, took the lead of the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried out for scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He summoned Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minnini and accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but the court said in an arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had dared to demand a change in the A3 project.
The eavesdropping against Dal Torrione reveals, state prosecutors write, that “he was inclined to comply with the demands of an extensive entrepreneur representing a group known to be close to the Piromallmi family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the clan.”
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is only now being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, ocean currents, tides, all of these are renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron have been looking for, and now they're trying to get their hands on it.
For a hundred years, they have been researching how to extract energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research intensified.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of using offshore energy was set aside, but today the demands of environmental protection and the renewed rise in oil prices give the sector a new impetus.
In 2007, the London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be met by installations that use waves in the sea.
This is twice as much as the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy and in 2005 signed an agreement to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolution when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are opting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and is considering working with us," a spokesman for the US oil giant's associate company, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit issued by the US Energy Commission to launch a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a matter of great importance, especially considering the fact that the US is currently extracting oil in Alaska and that President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are also on the path of offshore energy. The amounts invested so far, as far as details are known, show growing interest.
Technology is to be developed.
According to the experts, this is still a rudimentary technology, just because energy from the sea does not dispel any doubts about its environmental impact.
Existing installations, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size, and therefore do not pose a major problem for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a larger scale, however, we need installations with a greater environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected buoy system.
The thrusts generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are transformed into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure turns a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electricity flows over subsea cables to land.
At the moment, there are four similar facilities in the design phase, which are still awaiting federal approval, and some of the energy generated will be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six undersea turbines at the East River Strait in New York.
At tides, the movement of water rotates the blades of the turbines, and this rotational motion feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are just waiting for permissions to use energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, special attention should be paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through tides.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent <0x24>7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the tides, which is expected to increase to <0x24>35 million in 2009.
