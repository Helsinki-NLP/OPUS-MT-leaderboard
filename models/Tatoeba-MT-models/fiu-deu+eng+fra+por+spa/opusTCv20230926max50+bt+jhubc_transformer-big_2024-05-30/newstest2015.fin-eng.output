The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The City Council of Kuopio unanimously approved the union on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal association, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After joining Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of approximately 111,000.
Prime Ministers of Japan and India meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, will meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, on his first major foreign visit since the May election victory.
Modi’s five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economy.
At the top of the discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting at civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to engage in a meaningful political dialogue with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tassi.
He also said pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were shooting at civilians.
“The militia fighters’ goal is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they don’t get the chance to shoot down the residents of the area,” Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was surprising that the crowd arrived early in the evening.
The number of visitors during the two days was as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re still going to be hip-hop festivals, so pop is not allowed,” Kangas says.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law restricting the procurement of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for a permit from the Police Board in order to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as so-called precursors of explosives.
Such substances are hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them, if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but their concentrations do not normally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Nairn and Pitlochry
The defendant of the rape at two hotels is facing trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing in the Glasgow High Court.
She is accused of rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman “when she is unconscious, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision for herself.”
Webster was also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
According to the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place on 17 November in Edinburgh at the High Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shined - Mario got out of the shadows - Premier League - Itta-Saomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is seen as a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, who had been strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived to Tottenham as a guest.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude from Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and baited only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
The fans of the Pool, who have already been favorites of the player, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who traveled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker, alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, Raheem Sterling, a middle-field diamond, glittered the team’s star, pushing a 3-0 win over the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, isn't just brilliant.
An Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli is between the lines of his opponent than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who is racing on the grass at a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irelander explained how Liverpool has systematically developed from a Northwest Londoner at the foot of Wembley into a more holistic player.
Susanna Mälkki was elected as the Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Board of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra starting in autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times newspapers have been asking which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she starts her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the music life of our country for over a hundred years, e.g. by premiering a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he says.
Employee organisations' administrations meet in pension negotiation - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, we are looking for a new impetus for pension negotiations from the social partners’ own meetings.
The administrations of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Among other things, labour market organisations have been stirred up by controversy over linking the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be created during this week.
Confession.
Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team Woman Volley stumbled on Vampula's athletes in the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned a stretched match into a 3-2 win.
The last round of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in defense and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo’s six was so sloppy that 190-centimeter-long American centrist Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
The player was Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play with Johanna Pekkarinen in spite of her thumb span and formed the most fiery combination of WoVo.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, got to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampire was a skilful Russian pass and a liberal Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at 6 pm in an official training game.
On Sunday we will meet again at the sporting school.
Lidl is battling wild figures in Finland
During the financial year ended at the end of February, the company’s net sales in its Finnish stores increased by almost 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and its expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer causes more deaths in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at a higher risk of ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
The researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Australia in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Senior researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas are 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers reviewed women’s health history over a period of seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, past illnesses and socioeconomic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and with a wider spread of cancer at the time of diagnosis, the chances of survival were lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
While the study did not attempt to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their clinics are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While remote treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients who are treated far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, women with ovarian cancer have poor long-term survival rates regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the sled parking operations in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for a town plan for the Friendship Park and its immediate surroundings will be made publicly available at the Osviitta service point.
Opinions on the draft plan will be requested from the Environmental Board and Lapland Ely-keskus.
With the help of the planning change, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobile activities related to tourism in the area.
The plan is to create a park area that includes the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
Between 15 November and 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available.
Refuelling points may also be located in the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed for the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling during winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
The sled parking and schematic change have raised loud opposition.
The residents of neighboring apartment buildings have been both anxious about the noise and about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied and no findings above the guideline values have been found.
Renewed vehicles are also less polluting than the old ones.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers would have to be transported to the departure points of the safaris by buses, which are estimated to have 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and its surroundings are also wide enough for the sledges, better than the places presented as substitute starting points, such as the east side of the boat dock of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is also good for its location, because the activities can be expanded in the future, for example, to the Ounaspaviljonki area.
Establishing parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the city’s objective is, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by allocating sufficiently high-quality areas to logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the sub-plan of the city centre, which has not yet become legally binding.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings can be seen in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially those under the age of 35, could lead to a drop in garden store turnover by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales in terms of age.
According to a report by the Financial Times, home renters spend only 55% of the money they spend on gardening.
The study had also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is shrinking as the front garden is increasingly paved as a parking space. Also, these factors threaten the gardening industry, which is estimated to be worth about <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year.
In the Greater London area, ownership of dwellings has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and it is the country that spends the least money per household on garden products.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), increasing renting of homes or decreasing the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, senior garden advisor at RHS, says that “for example, plants grown in portable growing containers are especially popular among home renters, because such growing containers can be taken with you when you move if necessary.”
According to HTA’s report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period for the gardening sector as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, after the worse weather in March and April last year.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called on the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on spying by the U.S. and Britain in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. embassy's affairs chief and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main target of spying by US and UK intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the report’s significance by saying that all the major states have been spying on each other.
An earlier report of spying on Ankara by the main German intelligence service provoked a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze has been featured in a new Finnish film.
Croze will star in director Mikko Kuparinen’s film 2 nights until morning, whose shooting will start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in The Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Butterfly in the Glass Dome.
Two Nights to Morning starring Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorca’s Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
The allegants presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Council officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Calvià police chief on the Mallorca holiday island has been arrested following allegations of corruption made by shop and bar owners in the Magaluf area for wet celebration.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in pre-trial detention after several shop owners on Punta Ballena, where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located, have filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who reported the incident presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Council officials at the office of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were angry at the bias of the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of newspapers in several countries this summer when an online YouTube video of an 18-year-old British vacationer having oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl was released.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcohol-intensive pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for one year and Carnage, the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl, was jointly fined EUR 55,000.
Especially among young British tourists, the so-called balconing trend has also become popular in the tourist destination Magaluf, which has caused many alcohol-related accidents when people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters as their communities were bombarded by rockets and mortars during the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed communities of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
At the Pashosh kindergarten in the south of Ashdod, workers removed traces of fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after a rocket hit the kindergarten.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city's school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, feels that returning to school after a long time is "a bit strange."
“We’ve had difficult times when we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of people living in Saad-like border communities had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas in Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are sceptical of the return after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than 10 families have not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border, which was the target of heavy Palestinian fires.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of”.
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not resolve a number of key issues, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of the air and sea routes in Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to UN and Palestinian estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, claiming that at least half of them were soldiers, although it had no conclusive evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in more than 100 UN-managed schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still sheltered and the fighting continued, school officials postponed the start of the school last week.
"I hope that school will open soon and that we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, 13-year-old who lives in a sheltered school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used metric, housing prices have risen the most in seven years during the Australian winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures the prices of dwellings in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP’s data on Monday.
As a result, prices increased by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of rising prices.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne last year.
The housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the next busiest; the average increase in prices is between five and six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices only rose by 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in sales of homes to be auctioned, the overall high sales rate and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless said.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and fine arts have attracted record-breaking audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has featured pop art classics by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mänttä Art Week said on Monday that it had set a visitor record after 14,500 visitors to the Hetkinen event this summer.
We are not accustomed to these numbers.
People have been sweeping through doors and windows,” says Pauli Sivonen, Director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to Serlachius museums will be close to 100,000 this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilpula, located between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
It is hoped that the art period in Mänttä will continue long over the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani over the past few days.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken by breaking a window.
The perpetrator had taken a small amount of money with him from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from the tank of a truck.
Between Sunday and Monday, a boat with outboard engines had been stolen from Petäisenlänska’s marina.
The rowing boat was white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside was written "OIVA" on the front.
A couple of suspected thieves have already been caught by police.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into.
A police dog got a mark and a 20-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding under a tree in the forest.
On Monday, police caught another man in Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same robbery.
Missing amphetamine brought murder charges in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge against a man born in Kajaani in 1977.
According to the prosecution, the man entered the apartment with his unmarried partner and another man and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman suspected of being a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed the other man with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car with a party burning clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a rifle was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will give its verdict later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August occurs on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual throughout the country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, “My father never hugged me.
She never said she loved me
Henry was born in Dudley, Midlands, England, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently rehearsing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, partly based on a fictional conversation with his father and developed based on the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at an upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
My dad was very hard to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, “Stop making noise.”
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of beer or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner for me, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, gaining an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better now than they were at the time.
The smelters are a little brighter nowadays, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths with flames, smoke and soot bursting and reminiscent of hell.
My father used to take a bath and lie down in the bathtub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the smelter dirt away from himself.
As I walked around the melting pot, I realized that he had been working on it for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood lacked the intimacy provided by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn’t until my mother started getting sick a little before she died that we began to repeat that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to her mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from excessive weight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full reversal.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce my symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
Nobody enjoys eating carrots.
Henry’s well-known, short beard perhaps describes his transition during his career.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making theatre.
It was followed by the Comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("Fences").
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only a 16-year-old factory worker.
A dish-jockey spotted him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent contest.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For quite some time, I was the only black imitator and comedian of television," he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to make jokes on a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living in the spotlight and on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where the characters appeared as blacks, so Henry ended up a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was strange and reprehensible, I was allowed to work on huge events and learn how to handle the audience.
Yet "the British TV's award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a frenzied parody of black people".
In the 1980s, Henry worked on a second comedy series that both made fun of and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was aired in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his role as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade working on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movies, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len?
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part is about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears tights and has money.
That is why the Shakespeare issue aroused my fear.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You’ll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"That's what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verses, do a little background research.
So the practice process was tough, and I read the play for months before it took place.
The play was ultimately a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it did not quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the British National Theatre and I couldn’t believe it.
At one point, the thought came to me: “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once upon a time there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do it for 10 minutes on your own until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the instructor’s assistant announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem had been resolved.
I walked out of the stage, and a part of me sighed of relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
“You’re part of the play, stay in your role.”
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
This is what Henry says in a different voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: our conversations are constantly interrupted by little humor boys as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from the stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate praise from an unknown audience.
If you are thirsty for it all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo theater when I feel like it, but in general it doesn’t excite me the way it did before.
I'm going to ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It brings me real joy to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the entire journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his rebirth?
Yeah, I think so.

Kenya prepares register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun compiling a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “ghost workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, the salaries of “ghost workers” and other financial abuses cost at least <0x24>1 million per month.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his position as an official, the BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reported from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials must register in the next few weeks at the identification centers to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
Any person who fails to do so without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in their duties. It will also clean up payrolls at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
Seinäjoki’s financial result for the financial year 2015 may be in deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure trends in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparations, the annual margin is about 9.4 million euros.
Potential ways of improving efficiency were to negotiate the scope and level of services, purchases of services, sale of assets and grants, and increases in tax and payment revenues.
The investment reduction target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in central government contributions further undermine the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city council is unanimous in the need to make savings.
The ship must be turned to the target set by the strategy,” says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the submitted proposals to the Executive Board for further preparation.
The proposals of the City Board will be the basis for the budget preparation at the council’s financial seminar in Frami on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds to the City Board and the City Council through the Board.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for “conspiracy” against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “anti-government plots,” local media sources said.
Police did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among the detainees.
Some of the police officers were involved in last December’s corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large criminal squad and tracking phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) said police actions were part of the planned actions of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who works as a leading teacher at the Slaviansky school, where Yatsenyuki's daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally children's embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry from Texas says slanderous tweet was unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry’s verified Twitter account posted a slanderous picture of a Democratic district attorney in the middle of his hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't accept the tweet and I've deleted it," a later publication said.
Perry's backing team did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were posted from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a defamatory cartoon of Travis’ district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for the Lehmberg post after he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was indicted. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The headline of the tweet read: “I don’t always drive drunk, at three times the permissible rate of promille... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury's investigation into Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge to dismiss the accusations and has said that the law on the basis of which the Governor of Texas, who has been in office for the longest time, is being prosecuted is unclear when mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut <0x24>7.5 million in state subsidies to the state's public inviolability unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-wing monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry announced he would end the draw by posting a picture of himself jogging on the lake on Twitter with the message "Here I come, South Carolina!".
Berkeley Says Housing Market Is 'Normal' Again
One of London’s major developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
London’s homes have been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases, while fears of a widespread credit bubble have prompted the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of Berkeley, said Monday that “since the beginning of the financial year, the market and the volume of trades have returned to normal since the 2013 peak,” adding that this has allowed for a “stable operating environment.”
The London housing market went well during the recession, as foreign investors tried to reach the capital in hordes.
According to land registry data, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus well above the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth last year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the increased pound has made London real estate a less attractive destination in recent months – some interest has also been influenced by new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible “manor tax” before the May general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which announced tighter lending regulations, would lead to lower levels of market growth in both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed that the volume of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Hamptons International, a real estate broker, has lowered its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices by 3%, according to which prices will fall as the index measuring homeowners’ opinion on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions in the most expensive London areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter from a year ago, real estate agent WA Ellis said.
The demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased the income from the properties sold to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right-looking product in the best locations has remained stable and thus sales have remained high".
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at the peak before the financial crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent year-on-year by <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Pidgley said on Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s earnings for the year are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the full-year pre-tax profit is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The Berkeley stock was sold on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at a steady price of <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence is attending the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold hundreds of other stars leaked nude photos of Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images were authentic and condemned the hacker for "a blatant invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence’s stolen photos will be charged.
The photos that were originally posted on the 4chan image release page apparently fell into the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple’s iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other hacked stars is alleged to include dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how many of the photos are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
“To those who look at the photos my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorial" series denied the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that "these so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, don't you see?"
Let me put an end to this right from the start.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
Just for us, an extract from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel about love and the "J"
They dissolved, it portrayed what had best happened, gradually loosening from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, laborious, intense, disconnected, and perhaps also a little spiky.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was spiky like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had been an initial relationship, however promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and perhaps even brought some content into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately tender beauty with a heart of joy, from a village in the north that was even rougher and farther from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern presumed to be his aunt. His aunt had inherited a house in a wet but paradise-like valley, appropriately called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the snails had left their marks on the windows, holding the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be announced next week
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailin on a broken terrace chair in the middle of long grass, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to a receiver through which the whole country heard calming music and soothing news, as Ailin’s crossed, sun-brown feet often brought to Kevern’s mind a song that had long been sung by a black man.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not forbidden – nothing was actually forbidden – they were simply no longer played.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word forgot.
Public opinion produced what the law and the decree had not achieved: just as in the literary sphere people chose to read heroes' memoirs, cookbooks, and romances, in music they preferred ballads.
As the day went wild, Kevern started typing a fictional piano and singing a serenade to Ailin’s big feet with a bold, comical voice.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally lifting two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's what her father had always done before the "J" got out of her lips.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let out a word that starts with "J" in your mouth and didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a fun game then, and it wasn't a fun game now.
He knew it was expected of him, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn’t banned, it wasn’t played.
Improvisation was no longer in vogue.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the ingenuity played through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that she did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its members accepted with gratitude—thankful for having been spared by the trade of happiness—the principle that each group did things inherent in it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean pedigrees are best suited for entertaining and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally natives of the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to do things.
Those who remained from the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When what happened, if it happened, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled swiftly to the land, fearing that they would continue to be accused of blazing flames, and fearing that the flames would reach them next, opened restaurants where they were served labhneh law.
Let each one act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for her to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung could ever have been put into music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the bigfoots.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of security.
Not a word would pass through the soundproofing of the leaves of giant cabbage heads.
Ailin didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
Ailin thought he was weird already.
“He thought it was funny,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There is nothing to see in the whole world but Ailin’s huge, crow-black hairline.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailin seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles," he said, trying to correct the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when she wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because she, like her father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her terrace chair, pouring over the receiver and spilling the wine they had just drunk.
Even the wine was made of only backbone, so he could not use it as a cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what makes me so perversely attracted to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both for her own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear she saw in her eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to stand against her.
Did Ailinn think she'd hit me?
He had never told Kevern about life in the cold northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had been basically the same as life here.
The same huge, frosty sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and more devilish after the EVENT than their smuggler and scattering grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suction first – kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounters between men and women; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, because the suction itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him—just as her traveling companion watched Kevern from the window upstairs—a man who was the cause of his difficult life.
When Adam left the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands to attack him.
A man turned his back, bent, shameful, beaten, who had lost all the will to fight—why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember ever having seen it before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Public Opinion Institute in Ofnow, conducted a short study on the persistence of minor to medium-severe violence in areas of the country where a decrease in violence, or even an end, was most likely given the money and energy spent to eradicate it.
“A great deal has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done,” he wrote, “in order to smooth out the inherent aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and who have often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners, where, despite the towers stretching over hedges, human gentleness has been rarely known in the course of time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it produces.
The people weep among sentimental ballads, devour stories of victorious adversities, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural communities and urban shared dwellings in their relentless grip, and there is evidence of a new, more malicious way of fighting even in the streets and at work.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
I have to ask myself, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
You're a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Silence again.
“I don’t ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I oppose atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is entirely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, like the ones you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the Church – and what you call cruelty or evil spirit, others usually call innate energy and physical strength.
Saying THAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it ever happened, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, a flamingo-pink LED light proclaimed a direction that Ofnow had distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
“Speaking is better than silence, and a sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.”
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, confident that her supervisor had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to what happened if it happened.
This time, though, we will not pour out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "describing as 'mistakes' the actions that our grandparents may or may not have done.
You’re also going too far when you say they’ve shed their ‘hate and distrust’.
A person in a position like yours should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group in society can say that they behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done, was done, whether good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it – we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to spread accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what is the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said, indicating that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist riding on the sidewalk, who was described by passers-by as "evil and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning attack; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Officials in the Lesotho army have denied having framed an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they were working against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had besieged his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling them he was threatened with death.
The army spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack, saying that the army was responding to a threat from 'political fanatics', which is said to have attempted to arm the fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics who are ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America.
South African government president Clayson Monyela said the military’s actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"While no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be in every way consistent with the characteristics of a revolutionary attempt," he said.
Officials in the Lesotho army said the soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is leading the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements in the government of the Great Coalition.
He thus denies that he has undermined the power of the government, despite the allegations to the contrary.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft sets up data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, a location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement, Microsoft said it would not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the place of the centre had previously been predicted to be Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will shut down its offices in Oulu, which will take away some 500 jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft’s Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company did not comment on the number of employees employed by the new data center.
Kauppalehti announced the establishment of a data center in Uusimaa on Monday.
Man accused of hitting girl on traffic lights
A 78-year-old man is accused of hitting a three-year-old girl on traffic lights in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of hitting a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, East Neuk.
Prosecutors said Stewart had driven his Audi Q3 unwittingly and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at the hearing of the Dundee Sheriff.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered a trial in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a variety of device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around <0x24>300.
I personally took these photos at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than <0x24> 350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproof.
In addition, set the camera’s shooting settings to match the images or video you’re shooting.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize underwater shooting conditions.
In addition, before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can withstand a depth of only 5 feet, while others can withstand a depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple photos – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and image composition can either succeed or fail.
Take several pictures.
If your camera also allows fork shooting, which means taking multiple photos at the same time with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This also adds more colors to your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you can see.
Try to get close to the subject.
This is an important piece of advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater, because light conditions are scarce.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide viewing angle, i.e. the camera must be close to the subject in order for the subject to fill the entire image, including the frames.
China won’t let Hong Kong elect its leaders – protesters swear by revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament ruled that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 election despite growing unrest that demanded democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district as activists began planning and executing demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The Chinese People’s Congress has decided to give the Communists the power to banish all candidates who disobey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it's still infuriating," Democratic Party chair Emily Lau said.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese administration, saying it would be too "chaotic" to stand as a general candidate for the election of Hong Kong's leader.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom ceded Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the region that it would be able to elect its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to tightly control the electoral process through a nomination committee that is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the region’s largest and most striking protests in years.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the block of business if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and that they would trigger waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considers the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that the centre will be occupied.
Hong Kong officials have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fuelled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has created competition for goods and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement for threatening Hong Kong’s survival —the business world.
"The protest they're talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people participate in it and how long it lasts," said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from us to spread.
That would be a bad idea for investing.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the minions of the Western powers that are stirring up the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on the right to vote, in which 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters – participated.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
U.S. Prom Tradition Strikes British Universities: Private Jets for New Students
We are excited to meet this demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury travel mode for today’s students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the customer’s arrival at the university is as memorable as possible.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the extreme.
Combined with the many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company’s representative, no reservations have been received yet, as the service has just been set up, but added that “students will start placing orders in the next few weeks.”
The company believes there is demand for the service, although most students pay tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Students’ Association criticises the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organisation’s higher education section, “this service plan seems to be a long way from the life of the majority of students.”
Many people starting their studies this month are shocked by the level of cost of living, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants have lagged behind the tremendous rise in basic cost of living. Only then can we begin to think about where to find thousands to use for such a simple thing as arriving on campus.
Ipswich "pighouse" for sale
Real estate agents removed the photo of the house for sale in Suffolk when they noticed that there was a big pig lying in the living room.
The one-bedroom house, at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head to the couch.
Real estate agent Connells says the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the image ended up in the announcement accidentally and has since been removed," the company's representative said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting room as a “unique one-bedroom house.”
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has aroused interest in social media, where questions have been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Spain's Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the substitute stepped in with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea has signed a four-year contract with Loic Remy's neighbouring club, QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.

Bulgarian prison staff holds national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted the old working rules, which were recently amended, back.
Wage increases will also be discussed with interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite a meeting between the Prison Workers' Association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, said Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the Directorate-General for Enforcement of Judgments.
The Prison Workers’ Association’s protest is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior’s trade union.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin almost fainted on the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland’s victory today.
He was able to forget his black U.S. game and beat the blood of Ukraine in the second half with stopping solutions.
But Salin handed over all the credit to the wolf fans, and he did it in style:
I almost fainted at the end of the field, the encouragement was so great.
In his eyes, but blurred, there was nothing he could do.
The noise and the white sea were almost too much for me.
Salin’s moments of power included nine surfaces in rapid pace, ball-playing, plate-playing, and scrambling wherever it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode that all worked out.
They just come from somewhere, now in a ridiculously important place, Sasu glowed.
That's my part.
Doing all that.
It was great to see others catch up.
It caught up with the whole gang.
Salin is the joy pill and the spirit creator of the team, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years break: The previous ones reminded me of an outrageous referee game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men’s national volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as if it were yesterday: it was a fiery match against France in the Premier League.
"In the decision balls of that match, the referee's game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams were already in the back.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that the pashs went even more crazy," Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is back in the world championships, as Poland’s World Cup starts on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
Players’ power values are roughly the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is even faster,” he thought.
What will happen in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the strain can be shared.
I look forward to Finland getting on with the start.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a victorious match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let’s hope we’re in 17th place.
"South Korea and Tunisia should go down," Parkkali said.
The legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö played for Tunisia.
Sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's programme for the 1982 World Cup.

Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the praise"
When Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
During the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said on Facebook that a Cita dog who was with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog could no longer walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a little further, but its legs just didn’t carry it,” Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said there was no help from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passers-by.
By nightfall, the situation was starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway, Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen, and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of a hillside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog,” Antti Soini tells in a message he sent to Ilta-Sanomi.
Soon a German man arrived with a mattress.
From the mattress, Cita was provided with a kind of stretcher to which the injured dog was attached.
A German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried it down the slope for a while, Soini says.
Photo by Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of a mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook so he could thank them once again.
The sounds answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unaccounted for.
“I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes,” Mikkelsen said.
If they hadn't helped me, we probably wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, and I will be forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the sounds were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - I hear Cita is feeling better already!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
A British woman feared death for years because of a misdiagnosis.
For most of her youth, Karin Rodgers thought she had only a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
Actually, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms of motor weakness, such as muscle weakness, inconvenience to walk, and toe dripping.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friederich's ataxia (FA), which had a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would end up in a wheelchair before turning 18 and die before turning 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and everything took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his legs. During the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers, which said he had FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he said.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would end up in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers tells us that by the age of 17, he found that his walking had not gotten as bad as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl, I don’t think you have this disease, otherwise you’d already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT was, I thought I was being postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal car in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal migrants on board a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The passengers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 each to get to Greece, and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800-900 to get to Serbia.
A large number of illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled Syria’s bloody civil war.
The Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop bands Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, the bands will be starring in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scotland's independence will be held on 18 September.
In a statement, Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for the Scots that only happens once in their lives.
In the past, actor Sean Connery has supported independence.
In contrast, British stars such as Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scottish people to remain part of the UK.
In Gallup, the supporters of independence have been defeated.
Difficulties in department stores continued in the middle of the summer - Domestic news - Evening-Sanomat
The downturn in the department store trade continued in July, says the Finnish Grocery Trade Association.

In contrast, the sales of groceries have increased by almost one per cent.
Joan Rivers' family "hopes for the best"

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto reactor 3 to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3.
According to Areva’s announcement, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the fact that the reactor’s automation systems have been applied for approval.
The project has already been delayed for years.
In May, TVO did not give any estimate of the time of completion of reactor 3.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach plot to Bottas - valued at approximately EUR 60,000
The municipal government of Nastola donated to Formula Driving Valtteri Bottas a 1.4-hectare land plot on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi from Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair spirit of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no sounds at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
Bottas' gift plot has farm buildings - seven in total.
The city will take them out this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure apartment on the plot within two years.
We are honored that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has been to primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
Hopefully it will continue, says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the value of the land to be between EUR 40,000 and 60,000.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Throughout the decades, Nastola has managed with varying degrees of success to keep successful sportspeople through gift plots in the municipality.
World champion of spear throwing Aki Parviainen and world champion of aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo got their detached land from the municipality and built fabulous detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola, but sold their property and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved to another place as the life situation changed.
Bottas is a native Nastolian and his situation is different, Syrakki says and believes Bottas will remain in his municipality.
Hull hired the striker with a record amount of Hernandez
Hull placed the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will move to Hull from Palermo for <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo defeated Serie B and entered the Italian league.
For the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In the World Cup last summer, Hernandez came in two matches from the exchange to the field.
“Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time,” Hull’s head coach Steve Bruce said.
On Monday, Hull also announced that he had acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian Space Test Failed: Geckos Deployed for Sex Trip Killed
Five small geckos sent by Russia to proliferate in space have died, the Russian Federation’s space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The geeks travelled on Photon-M4 for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geese in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, it was meant to be serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of geek eggs, for example.
The effects on geckos can be used to anticipate the effects of weightlessness on a person in a state comparable to a longer period of time, New Statesman illustrated in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the cause or causes of death of geeks will be investigated.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers called "sex geeks" were frozen.
The fact that fruit flies traveling on the same Photon-M4 survived the trip and also had offspring is another sign of surprise.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities reported on Sunday.
Authorities tracked him down after he used money to lure a 16-year-old girl into Syria.
She was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
He is said to be from Chechnya, but now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had already tracked the man’s actions.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalizing young people who have been lured into wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French nationals or persons registered in France have travelled to, returned from or are planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning.
The national basketball team’s hopes for a sequel are at stake when Finland faces Ukraine in their second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss for the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe that we have a good chance of winning.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who plays aggressive basketball in Ukraine.
Ukraine's key player is game manager Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against them before and we need to get our standard defenses in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than it did in its defeat to the United States yesterday.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee that we will see a normal herd of wolves on the field, Möttölä said.
Hollywood Stars Spread Their Nudity Images Online – Parts Confirmed to be Genuine
A number of nude images allegedly depicting famous celebrities are circulating on the Internet.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a “sleeping campaign.”
The entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant breach of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are authentic.
She took these photos with her husband years ago.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible effort was made to do this.
I sympathize with everyone who became a victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Actress Victoria Justice has claimed that the images in her name are fake.
There are also real or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka’s goalkeeper criticized his own: “They aren’t working hard enough to get out of here.”
Football club FC Honka is currently in the last place in the Veikkausliiga.
The comments of goalkeeper Walter Viitala after Sunday’s VPS game illustrate the club’s confused current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything,” Viitala said after a 1-2-loss struggle.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the bad defensive game.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been very busy this summer, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a frequent pace.
With the introduction of roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some of them don't work hard enough to get out of here," Viitala said without naming a single player.
Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to the trainings and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," he said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot be expected to be instantly successful when their friends are constantly changing.
There have not been two consecutive matches in this season.
Especially in the defensive, the group has changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After a VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, equal to the second-last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espoo players still have time to avoid falling into the 1st round.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We will certainly not miss out on this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier to make a TV series after decades
Director Lars von Trier is returning to the television series.
The Danish director is preparing a television series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, the producer of Trier’s films, announced the project on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
Production company Zentropa said the series should start shooting in 2016.
Trier is said to be focusing on the series’ script work starting this autumn.
The series is in English.
Trier’s long-time partner Peter Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen, famous for his hard selling talks, also announced the mysterious project.
He said a series like this “has never been seen and will never be seen.”
"Hold your breath," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the TV series Kingdom.

The first stores were opened in 2002.
Ice Bucket Challenger's chin displaced
British Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when she was poured ice-cold water that it damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment after she screamed at the Ice Bucket Challenge so hard that her jawbone was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just yelled, but when I yelled, I felt my jaw start to stiffen," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old who participated in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where her chin was reinstated.
The video has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The perspective of howling wolves (also): How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great day.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 after Finland had played in the European Championship against France in the Marouss ballroom in Athens.
The soft one did not exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the approximately one hundred Finns who were shouting at 20,000 spectators, otherwise in an empty hall of noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine?
In Bilbao, the number of Finnish fans is eighty-fold.
The 1995 European Basketball Championships were the year of Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Centre.
That victory opened the door to European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä to the final team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far wise, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team plunged deep.
At the Olympics in Athens, there were reportedly a little over 100 Finns present.
This included journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can tell the exact number of tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number in between, it is an incomprehensible number.
This is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, businesses are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit our girls and boys to see how they are succeeding in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Physical Sociology.
Surely both in Spain and at the World Volleyball Championships in Poland there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
A shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself has to have attraction.
Itkonen puts sport into popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to a sporting event than to go to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
That’s when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team was lifted to a stand.
The Volleyball team did the same thing a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of their work.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productize their top sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Will the ball sports be able to transfer this massive interest to the home series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played on average for hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and doesn’t necessarily give an answer that promises very good to the species.
The second school believes that interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who does not want a sweet belly full.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series are not of dual interest.
It’s a challenge for people in the middle of a drug addiction.
Bottas plot securing - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach home.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a free-time apartment will be built.
Nastola has been following Bottas’ success since his karting days.
He is considered a good ambassador to promote Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, by Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in the area that will be demolished, six of which will be demolished by the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth podium in the Belgian Formula One race this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastol and lived in Villähde during his childhood.
He currently lives in England, but visits Nastola whenever he is free.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are tested by the ball players on the field, but Marcus Giron, an amateur who is one of the top university players, also wears one.
He says the shirt will help him track his own progress and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, and the information is transmitted to the shirt and then to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The central unit is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given an exact time for the sale of the shirt, nor has it even implied the price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Athos, a Californian, has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothing costs <0x24>100 per piece, and the CPU that they require is the size of a thumb, costing <0x24>200.
Red Orbit also wrote about the techno-clothes.
A smart way to save money in textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds <0x24>1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year, came up with a smart way to save money.
He developed a system whereby later-year students borrowed their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them immediately.
“My math book would normally have cost <0x24>180; I paid <0x24>10 for it for the whole semester, plus a large sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester's book would normally have cost <0x24>430.
Instead, he spent <0x24>120 on them.
According to the University’s Board of Directors, the average student spends more than <0x24>1,200 per year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying significantly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which runs more than 250 on-campus bookshops, the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics in the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops in the spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from on-campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
E-shops
In online stores, you can get a new book for only one-third of what it would cost in a campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler recommend the ninth edition of Calculus for nearly <0x24>290, but Chegg.com sells the book for <0x24>239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn out appearance.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used at Chegg.com for <0x24>93.49.
Brigham Young University’s last year student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End Of The Advertising Business” from Amazon.com for just <0x24>0.42.
The book would have cost <0x24>48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential to education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon book stores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% on the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for an entire semester costs about <0x24>20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as fees for notes, use of the highlighter pen and wear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of ordinary papers may also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented out, paying for the e-book’s license to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store will sell "Calculus" as an e-book for six months for about <0x24>61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing different vendors, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book’s ISBN number to determine the price, as it helps to make sure you’re looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure you have the book in stock, Gault says.
He learned it himself through hardship.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price from a university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year
Fires have killed nearly twice as many people this year as last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), so far 55 people have been killed in 49 fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the organization’s statistics on fire deaths, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other detached houses.
Spek reminds us of the fire safety of the home.
At least all fire alarms in the home should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to deploy.
There must also be an unhindered exit route from all home premises.
Children should also be told what electrical appliances they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who had even arrived from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were lifted to safety after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in Australia’s New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
The families were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o’clock in the evening.
A search squad of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for the young, and the two were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and struck his head.
The police spent the night with the couple and were brought to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital and were in stable condition.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to withdraw.
Ukraine says parachutists have engaged in fierce confrontations with Russian tanks on the ground.
An army spokesman said the rifle was so sharp that the shooter was probably Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel that was hit by artillery in the Azov Sea off the south-east of Ukraine sank this morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Patrol had no idea where the ship was shot.
Separatists reported on social media yesterday that they had fired on the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, insisted that Ukrainian troops must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the talks in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should lead to an immediate unconditional ceasefire.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners," Lavrov said.
Severe rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets in Malmö and Copenhagen were flooded on Sunday when heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic and buried cars under them.
Authorities estimate on Sunday that the flooding may last, even though rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The Swedish authorities were surprised by heavy rains, and no weather warning was given in advance.
Ari Mustala, an on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the rainfall in the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French socialists should “silence and help France,” François Hollande’s main supporter says
Valls urged the deeply divided Left to "show its feelings" for a struggling socialist president whose new government did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay with him," Valls said, applauding him.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister urged the government to leave France’s controversial 35-hour working week alone, despite a controversial proposal earlier this week by the new economic minister Emmanuel Macron that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the socialists to work together with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused dissension by appearing at a meeting of socialist MPs with dissenting views and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
The leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, mocked the socialists’ ongoing dissension and said she did not believe Valls’ new government would last for more than a few months.
François Hollande may have gone to war by phone, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve the Parliament and was confident that his party would win early elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the top of the list in the May European elections.
According to a poll published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party could split into several rival groups before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Po University political scientist Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government did not manage to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to realise quickly that a change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
The Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Sira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda were badly betrayed by Pokka in the recorded part of the program.
The Good Morning Finland programme posted a funny video on its Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the Finnish advertising puff the next day, but the recording does not go exactly right.
Alm-Sira is confused in her words as she tries to pronounce the word budget debate, and her confusedness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their heads over and over again.
And these heroes should be allowed to host live broadcasts even tomorrow, says Morning in Finland’s Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared over 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked for the magazine photo agency, finished third in the series of portraits in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in May 1971 at the Building Masters’ House on Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, we had five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture four or five meters away.
The light and background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir’s face shows that Middle East leaders have had a difficult time before.
At that time, you could do well in the competition with pictures of well-known people or events.
It’s great that you can succeed with other images nowadays as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki evaluated his dissertation on information technology for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the information technology systems of investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Food and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a strange announcement on the wall of a school in Pirkkala caused food uproar on social media, says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes are included in the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old bulletin on the wall of the school.
You can see the picture here.
The image that has spread in social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Services, says to Yle that the note on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there was once such an idea, which has been discussed in time with health care.
Each student gets a meal according to their wishes, he says.
Today, Pirkkala schools offer a vegetarian option for pupils only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse on a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution for Yle on the grounds that young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave nutritional deficiencies and the lack of meat or chicken may cause wonders from the parents of the pupils.
Norwegian Cruise close to <0x24>3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for <0x24>3 billion.
Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of <0x24>6.8 billion, will have access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruises and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations are not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments, and Apollo refused to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships with route maps covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales grew by 13% from 2012 to 2013, when it was <0x24>2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brands, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its revenue in 2013 was <0x24>1.2 billion, which is 6% more than in the previous year.
The <0x24>29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from rising middle classes in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing to become the first choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first stock issue in the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 transaction, which was worth <0x24>850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with the merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested <0x24>1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting held 28 per cent of the company, Apollo 20 per cent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8 per cent of the company as of the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise in North America is 82%, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The City Council of Tampere is discussing this today.
Animalia hopes that the City Council will strongly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the period of dolphinaries in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a growing perception around the world that keeping advanced mammals like dolphins in dolphin aquariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also reach Tampere.
The closure of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of Näsi-dolphin strengthens demands for the closure of dolphinary operations.
The death of Näs is a sad continuation of the dark history of Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the prison for dolphins and begin to find out how the Tampere dolphins could be moved to a demarcated sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter," Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi didn’t have time to experience a return to the dolphin’s original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more than just an unstimulated concrete pool,” Tuomivaara hopes.
Animal Welfare Alliance Animalia aims to ban the use of all wildlife species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act under preparation.
This includes the dolphinariums.
In support of this demand, Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, will take part in a demonstration on 1 September on behalf of dolphins.
A demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or as food.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the region, Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels on an equal footing is in line with his obvious strategy since the beginning of the violence five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya instead of independence, allowing it to move towards your West Russia.
In an interview with the state's Channel 1 television channel, Putin denounced the Ukrainian army's attempts to recapture the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was captured by separatists in March and April following the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula by Moscow on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossiya", "New Russia" – a term similar to the days of glory that preceded the Russian revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks would be an “illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians continue campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people who live there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “statehood” is linked to a broader degree of independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev’s leadership as it attempts to dispel fears of Russian-speaking regions’ cultural and linguistic rights being threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov said.
There can be no talks on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
A Kremlin spokesman’s remark, aimed at correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks, highlighted that the Russian regime handles the separatist insurgency in eastern areas differently than in Crimea, effectively occupying an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to integrate even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian, and because, according to polls before the conflict, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give Ukrainian local governments the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin virtually power over the territory that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed to Russia five months ago, houses the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historic coastal sites.
In the area between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce vital products for the Russian army.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions other than Ukraine’s core region on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin’s latest request to the Kiev government was to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels moved further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area off the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area as far as Crimea.
It has led to the massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel, known as the steel-producing port city of half a million inhabitants, located between the narrow land area leading to Novoazovsky and the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, asking for additional measures to prevent Russia’s future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed further sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaysky region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be surrounded by Russia in Ilovaysk was replaced by 10 Russian parachutists who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
The opening goal for Milan was scored by Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari and Jeremy Menez scored a penalty kick.
Lazio also scored a rank in the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez declined Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In Milan's former striker icon Inzaghi's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half full.
The match was attended by 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has revealed that he is outraged that hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a series of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were posted on the Internet following a massive celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of star Lawrence and other superstars, including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko, living in Melbourne, were also reportedly stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Grecko's petition last month, Mr. Edelsten, told Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal communications and photos should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and spread.
Grecko, in New York City, reportedly commented on the incident in an online newspaper as “shamed” and said the victims “feel dishonored.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer in topless at the edge of the pool.
Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ magazine that “there is a blatant violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publication of stolen images from a mobile phone is no different from selling a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost like at home and won a sensational victory over Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the pictures of fanaticism.
On Monday, Katowice in Poland was white: not red-and-white in Poland, but blue-and-white in Finland.
Finland’s victory in the Spodek arena was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters, according to STT.
It felt like playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game,” Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland lost 0-2 in the game, but won 3-2 in the game.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miraculous rise from six points.
Cuba had already led the 16-10 round, but after that the Finns got excited.
A couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed, however, when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a fast pace in the last few days.
At the World Basketball Championships in Bilbao, Spain, there are more than 8,000 Finnish fans present.
It’s as if every Finnish basketball was a winning basket of the match, with US star Stephen Curry complimenting the Finnish basketball fans after Saturday’s match.
