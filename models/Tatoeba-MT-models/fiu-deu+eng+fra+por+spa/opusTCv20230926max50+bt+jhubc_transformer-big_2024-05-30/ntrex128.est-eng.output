Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear they will look like the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are shocked by the suggestion to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue is rooted in a plan to change the name of the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly, a member of the Labour Party, said that his groupmates were concerned because it rhymed with “Twp and Pwp.”
To explain to readers outside Wales: the Welsh word daft means dumb and pwp means poop.
A member of the board said the group as a whole was "not happy" and had suggested other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said her group was "susceptible" of the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "Muppet".
Explanation: In Welsh, the pronunciation of w is similar to that of u in Yorkshire.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are invited, of course, will be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey of the proposals on the name, which broadly supports the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of Members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the designation "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but in the public survey participants were most in favour of the option "MWP".
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement could be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including rules on the deprivation of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall remain with the members themselves during the legislative debate.
Macedonians to hold referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum will be held with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a demand for this territory and has repeatedly objected to its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum on the name change, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is just the price a country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as the churches in Harlem are struggling
“The older people I’ve spoken to have said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"There's neither of them anymore."
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People communicate differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people stay every day.”
As far as churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that “sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings full of people who do not reach out to the rest of the neighborhood’s churches.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "who are therefore accelerating the arrival of the day when all these churches will close their doors, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who live here will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin’s Church ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which had been worshipping nearby, took over the building’s ownership.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was heavily damaged, but when members of Father Johnson's parish were planning to rebuild the building, they introduced a carillon, or bell torch.
Father Johnson’s son and heir to the Church of St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the carillon “the watches of the poor.”
The expert who played Carillon in July, however, gave it another name: “cultural value” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carnival in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play the larger carnival 18 years ago at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin's Church in recent months has been the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been accompanied by secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
In July, the presidency of the Church, or the governing body of the parish made up of secular leaders, complained in writing to the bishopric that the bishopric “is trying to pass on the expenses”, although the presidency was not even involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members of the Society complained about the lack of transparency of the bishopric’s actions.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old boy who drowned in lobsters.
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark who dived into California for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that he had been diving for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then swam with the others to help pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought the boy expressed his enthusiasm for catching the lobster, but “then I realized that the boy was screaming, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire clavicle was torn bare,” Hammel described the sight he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I called to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
In a life-threatening condition, the boy was taken by plane to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the shark is still unknown.
Rescue officer and Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined that they were not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the hull.
Authorities have closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casablanca to Swami for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-like beauty corridors with expert advisors.
As part of a significant penetration of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion beauty market, which is still on the rise as sales of fashion and home goods continue to decline, wider ranges of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, introducing them to other stores next year if successful.
The reason for investing in beauty products is that supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its range of beauty products to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas such as those currently available in Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-establish its makeup line, Boutique, in which most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is testing exclusive sales licenses at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and switching to buying small amounts of food on a daily basis from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that the outlets are becoming more and more like supermarkets as the chain of supermarkets tries to fight low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats outlets since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and therapeutic products departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury's sold its 281 sons to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skin care products to its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to enhance the surrounding environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained employees who are always ready to advise.
Our range of brands meets every need. The attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty trade destination that can change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby gave up the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Dragons Den’s star Peter Jones left “angry” when TV presenter Holly Willoughby gave up an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is short of time for the home goods and clothing brand Truly.
The pair’s business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
The 37-year-old director of “This Morning” announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones infuriated by stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when the television star admitted at a stressful meeting held Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlows, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to devote to the homewear and clothing brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure his distant future, so she thought she would do it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything completely confused.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to launching the product line.
There's a warehouse at Marlow's headquarters full of goods for sale."
Experts believe that leaving the head of the TV show This Morning, one of the UK’s most well-paid celebrities, could cost the company millions because of the hefty amount of money invested in products ranging from sofa cushions and candles to clothes and household clothes, and may also result in a later launch of the product.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cappi for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin on I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones’ closest sources said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation, “after what we fell in love”
Trump joked about the criticism that was directed at him in the news for a comment that some consider “unworthy of the president” and overly positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his “news-anchor voice”:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “responsive response” to North Korea’s initial disarmament efforts.
Selmet noted that the United States will continue to impose pressure on the country in the future.
Trump's cheering speech was much more lively.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Everything is very well between us now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results: missile tests have been completed, hostages have been released and the repatriation of the remains of American servants has been arranged.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
“Being president is very easy, but instead of having 10,000 people wait outside to get into this stuffed stadium, it’s better to have around 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
When dealing with the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of Lombok’s population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so the stories are a little complicated," she said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the area.
A spokesman for the National Agency for Disasters, Mr Sutopo, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh for the tsunami, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although warnings were given about the tsunami, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren likely increased the number of deaths in the area.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is quite challenging even at the best times.
Natural disasters make the logistics of the area even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which has stopped to treat the victims of the Lombok earthquake, is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, and he has distributed money over roads and railways.
Budgetary deficits, however, threaten Mr Joko's government as new elections are ahead next year.
The tensions in Indonesia are also straining Mr. Joko amongst the separatists, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more anti-religious form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes as a result of fighting on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sets the tie in a game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League by tied in the 89th minute game at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge scored a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate when his team ran 1:0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it in the direction of a pole further away.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the grid.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq are passing the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I made one touch, and I hit him without much thought.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1:0 thanks to a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this game, the Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before he turned around in the middle and shot Liverpool halfway.
Kovacic scored a quick pass in the middle.
Then he created a nice air pass, leading Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard passed the defensive and hit the ball with his left foot in the direction of a pole further away from Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Champions League subgroup on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in a UEFA Euroleague game on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Several people were trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that led to the 18-metre tsunami on Friday, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
With a population of more than 380,000, the city of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation began after a woman's body was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are calling to contact people who may have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is only beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman's alleged friends came to the scene asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police said they are informing the woman’s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear of the incident.
The residents were told that it could take hours to get back into the house.
A police officer reportedly told one man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman was in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, “It’s terrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in a closed area, and the third was right next to it.
A number of police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using the keyword September 30, log 247.
The Cromwell Statue of the Parliament is the last memorial, the cause of the "rewriting of history" controversy
Eliminating it would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style done by his inhuman pious followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as nonsense and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain untouched by the monument in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not pillage pictures of the English Civil War himself, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell man was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas, the ancestor of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historical description of a person whom many people believe should still be honored."
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people were viewed by the end of the 19th rather than today as the defender of Cromwell’s parliament from outside pressure and, in this case, of course, from royalty.
Whether or not this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century controversy has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
Killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, in southwestern China, a farmer was attacked by a pig on a market that killed a man.
The man, who was identified as Yuan, was found dead with a wounded artery and covered in blood near a swine bush in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the Morning Post newspaper in southern China reported Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig keeper in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to vaccinate the pigs in his herd.
He and his cousin came from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, the man’s cousin found him dead and discovered that the neighboring pig hole was open.
He said the pig was a big bloody mouthed hog.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 249.47 kilograms had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and crushed,” Wu, the victim’s cousin, told Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed him was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the man’s death.
Although rare, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where he was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms nailed a Welsh farmer’s tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don’t usually attack, but because of the taste of blood, their heads can get stoned.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious maracas whose purpose is not to injure.
“You just have to respect them,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa’s aftershocks bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves across the northern coast of Mexico to cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa is bringing flooding rains to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 p.m. east coast time on Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a first-category hurricane with 136.78 kilometers per hour, located 619.59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure zone over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form, heading eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in a tropical storm, it begins to direct deep tropical humidity to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will arrive in Mexico, where it will rain up to 25.4 centimeters.
Subsequently, the approaching low-pressure responsive tropical humidity in the southwest of the country will create extensive heavy rainstorms in the coming days.
At times, rainfall of 2.54 to 10.16 centimeters causes dangerous sudden floods, flooding and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation to increase to five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in the regions of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is also expected to range from 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters in certain areas of the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
You should not walk in the desert in the event of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become fast-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by bursts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low-pressure climate at times leads to heavy rainfall in southern California’s coastal areas.
Total rainfall of more than 1.27 centimeters is possible and can lead to smaller floodwaters and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Scattered tropical rainstorms begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, with rainstorms becoming widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Severe rains will reach Four Corner on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations are predicted in the U.S., caused by cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures in the tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
The weather on Sunday is a great example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), reach nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the long summer heat will try to gather itself again.
A large portion of the central and eastern United States is expected to be warm at the beginning of October with extensively warming temperatures ranging around 80 degrees from the southern plain to the northeastern part of the country.
New York City is expected to reach 26.6 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a probability of high average temperatures in the eastern US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s trial was watched by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people on Thursday watched six television channels accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, of alleged sexual violence in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political deadlock continued where broadcasters interrupted the broadcasting of conventional shows to reflect Friday’s last-minute turns: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Legal Affairs Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed her drunk and tried to rip her clothes off at her high school prom.
In his passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people viewed the broadcast on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels displaying it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the number of people who watch transfers in the authorities.
In comparison, the audience is about the same as at the football finals or at the Oscars.
Fox News Channel’s opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, managed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured the man on Friday morning after he had fallen under the slander of protesters, trying to go to the Legal Affairs Committee meeting by elevator.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down when he was accused, and it was broadcast directly on CNN.
"I'm standing right here, right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the Legal Affairs Committee before the lift closed.
The cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate Plenary Assembly for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI is investigating charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by minority democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with his friend Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an effect, as it was obvious that Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without confirmation from the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of playing political games
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister accused those who criticized his plans to leave the European Union of “political play” with Britain’s future and harming the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the cover of a newspaper with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pushed his assault on May’s so-called Brexit agenda, saying the proposal to base Britain and the EU on each other’s tariffs is “completely brainless.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and put in prison on a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge police station said.
Authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, and police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS-owned television channel WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said his bail was set at <0x24>350,000 (<0x24>308,600.30).
An East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that said the death was caused by a bullet wound to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and the people living in the area for their assistance in investigating the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement agencies in the region for “putting care and justice on the ground.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at the LSU.
His previous season's average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team was “killed” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
"That's something you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano erupts ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano as operations resumed in the crater, which resulted in 183 gas and ash discharges being recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of thunders and tremors.
Social media shared images of ash-covered car windshields in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake erupted in September 2017 in central Mexico.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after a clash of independent protesters with riot police. Thousands joined anti-democracy protests to celebrate Catalonia's opposing vote on withdrawal.
A group of disguised separatist fighters, held back by the riot police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The riots also arose later when the police had to use sticks to control the fights.
Several hours of singing “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness,” the independence supporters confronted demonstrators who were in favor of the unity of the country, shouting “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, 14 people who were injured at the demonstration received medical care.
Tensions continue to rise in the region a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum of October 1 illegal, but which was still celebrated by the Catalans who were pro-secessionists.
Voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although voter turnout was low, as those opposed to the withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block the vote in front of polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence supporters had spent the night in front of polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the state police.
The protests took place, but they had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a pro-secession demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia independent.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
“I saw my parents cry for joy about the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have found it difficult to maintain their intentions this year, as a number of prominent leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording a demonstration on her mobile phone to support the police, said the dispute was fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tougher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since last year, announced that he would be taking part in the European elections next year.
"Candidacy for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the pressure from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car rammed house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car rammed a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
You could also shoot a bow at some point in the direction of the car.
Menga strike gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga wins first goal for Livingston
Livingston beat the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games in which he was the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will not win in the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, with eight points down.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
In the meantime, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of losing since Kenny Miler was replaced the month before.
Livingston Loses Opportunity for Stubborn Visitors
Holt's team should have led long before the goal was scored, as their straightforward playing style caused the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts stalled in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to capture Craig Halkett's headshot over the gate.
The hosts quietly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests in certain places.
And this is also how the defining gate was struck.
The Rangers gave up a free kick, and Livingston had the opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson, and Menga, who took the ball and managed it from the center of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers were mostly in possession of the ball, but could not penetrate the defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side was all mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defeated Scott Pittman, and Lithgow shone brightly in Livingston's teamwork again.
Two punches, one for attempting to replace Halkett Glenn Middleton and the other for attempting to touch the ball with his hand, were driven away.
A Phenomenal Achievement from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, fully exceeding the expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their style of play and players have barely changed since returning to excellence, but Holt has to pay tribute to how he has hardened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, arranging a perfectly organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back legs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Despite being at a good level in the meantime under Gerrard’s leadership, this was not enough, as the examples here suggested.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be inadequate: getting home only once, which could act as an alarm bell for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Controversial reception of Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) in Berlin, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been set aside on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police referred to security by forbidding a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up near it to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, most of whom are Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude towards the guest is divided: some Turks living in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise him as a sovereign.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist crashed into a car in London.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeastern of the city, at about 10:15 UTC.
The driver stopped and the ambulance doctors arrived to provide assistance, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision about two kilometers from the scene of the Saturday accident on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the cyclist escaped from the scene.
London police said the authorities were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Traffic at the scene is closed and buses are redirected, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Officers Injured in Unrest
The Prison Administration reported that six prison officers were injured in riots in a highly secured male prison.
The riots broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, and have not yet ended.
Expert riot police officers are involved in dealing with the unrest, which is concentrated in one wing and involves eight prisoners.
Prison officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison workers have been called to solve an ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prisoner had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
Last October, however, the riot police were summoned to prison in order to silence the serious riots during which prison officers were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (a hurricane may be beneficial to drought areas)
Tropical low pressures don’t hit Arizona often, but it’s likely to happen early next week as the crumbling hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwestern United States, bringing with it the threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already arranged to monitor sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa is headed directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area already on Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix State Weather Service tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low-pressure levels in a radius of 321.86 kilometers from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters, which could reach up to 15.24 centimeters in the confined areas of the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
In other desert areas in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Neighborhood, precipitation is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching up to 10.16 centimeters in limited areas.
For areas that can withstand sudden floods, the Rosa rainfall can be a blessing as the area suffers from drought.
While flooding is very worrying, such rainfall is also likely to be beneficial because of drought in Southwest America.
At least 40% of Arizona’s droughts are extreme, the second-largest category of droughts, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California peninsula on Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which was still at hurricane level on Sunday morning with the highest winds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at 19.31 kilometers per hour northward.
The storm is in contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and as a result, it subsides slightly.
So Rosa is expected to reach the mainland of Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of precipitation in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, rainfall can be expected with total rainfall of 7.62 to 15.24 centimeters, reaching at times up to 25.4 centimeters," weather.com said.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico for a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure zone that moves across Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat that follows Rosa or its aftermath is very strong rainstorms in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests linked to attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured at Midsomer Norton in the Excelsior Terrace area at 4 p.m. on Sunday.
The victim was taken to hospital in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered under the guilt and hatred of the Democratic Party”
“Judge Kavanaugh’s support is a voice against the relentless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his encouragement speech at Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered under the guise and hatred of the Democratic Party” during his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that he attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified on his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said, “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality and courage on that day.”
"The vote given for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the most respected lawyers of our time, with an impeccable background in public service," he told a crowd supporting West Virginia.
The President implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, while at the same time speaking of the importance of the Republic's turnout in the mid-term elections.
“We have five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “resist and prevent.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s candidacy in the Senate floor is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior vice president of the Republican Party told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill thousands, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away after the tsunami and earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when at night waves of six meters hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything on the road.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach, not fleeing immediately, becoming victims,” BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with him, wiping everything off the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching shores.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
Air photographs published by the Disaster Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Remains in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
With a population of 2.4 million, the area was hit by a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday after a severe earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city along the long and narrow bay may have increased the intensity of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could be greater in a coastal area 300 km north of Palu called Donggala, which was closer to the center of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the region,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its crew and volunteers are headed to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy that could get worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in the city of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur images on social media show a man on the upper floor of a building warning people panicking down the street of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to confirm the correctness of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power outage, which prevented communications in the Palu area and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft to Jakarta and other cities to provide assistance, authorities said, but evacuators still urgently need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining otherwise closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
That's really bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where they were sheltered in the tents erected in their office yard, they saw devastating sights on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said you saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's really bad.
While the relief forces began operations to mitigate the disaster vigorously, some complained that staff of foreign relief organizations with extensive experience were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, funds, supplies, and reinforcements can only be dispatched from abroad if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This continues to be a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, it's a national disaster,' we can start accepting international aid, but no such state has yet been declared."
When the second night came, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the miraculous cases that alleviate the gloom of natural disasters.
A little boy was taken out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the debris next to her mother’s body for two days.
Indonesian national paraglider team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing paragliders for Asian games that took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior paraglider, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the sliding paratroopers community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the "Please" competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey tick instead of two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages didn’t get through,” he said.
Thieves took <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 while filling the ATM at Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levees, the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
The driver emptied an ATM at the entertainment facility and prepared to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, “another man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the police said in a press release, but did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thieves is asked to contact the Newport Police by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West takes his new name Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Former Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and he also used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change takes place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled her concert "for the sake of feelings," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation for the man’s current performer name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious significance for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is one of the most commonly used words in the Bible, meaning ‘you’,” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, they are us.
I changed my name from Kanyest, which means "this one," to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and evil, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play with his name.
Sean Combs is mostly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used its name with and without thumbnails, capitals and lowercases.
Mexican politician Amlo promises he will not use the military against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador said on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use an army to control Mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people while leftist student movements were securing their heels across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free state universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its funding for research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financer and artificial intelligence researcher who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an overall formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China announced last year its plan to be a leader in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States and we are working towards the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double funding would double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat America's best Othello player. Later, he was a man on the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
"U.S. scientists need to work hard to get government funding," Lee said.
“China is not the one who takes over the intellectuals, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant researchers from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could help the U.S. support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who have received a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similarly to how the National Research Fund and other government agencies allocate funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a united artificial intelligence center, which aims to engage partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the creation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced that it had begun funding the <0x24>2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Research Fund is currently funding more than <0x24>100 million a year for artificial intelligence-related research.
At the same time, no changes have been made to the U.S. legislation aimed at setting up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Change of Country Name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from confirming its applications to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the new name for Macedonia, but nationalist opponents claim that the name would undermine the national identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not intend to participate in the referendum and the campaign of ignorance has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asks: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to secure membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
While the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in the Macedonian capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage in front of the parliament building in Skopje by raising chairs in front of the tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads upright, not through the door of servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and gain Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority is in favour of changing the name because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said that “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A recent survey by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are planning to take part in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
A Macedonian Telma TV poll revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of a referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government’s Western policy since the government took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defense of Brighton for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through the defense of Brighton, ensuring a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the impression that his 65th minute goal was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three of Brighton's defenders before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the border of the Brighton Penalty Area.
He then hit the ball to the left of himself, where was Sterling.
The English striker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by hitting the right side of the grid.
"Aguero has leg problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We told him he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored the goal at that point."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League fight.
The gate was struck in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton Territory.
He sent the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane managed to hit the ball a few times before driving Sterling further away.
The Sky Blues slammed the ball forward into the grid just before it slipped out of line.
Manchester City will play against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the joker against the Rockies
When the Nationals were left out of the final tournament games, there was no good reason for a new start.
Scherzer hopes to destroy the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who leads the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game in the NL West, still have a chance of reaching the final.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies guaranteed at least a joker seat, but the team still wants to secure their first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver with this audience and the other team is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect to play this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals have not yet named a Sunday opening player, but are allegedly inclined towards Scherzer's pass in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, did a warm-up session on Thursday and feed as usual on Sunday.
This right-handed Washington player leads 18-7, has an ERA of 2.53, a field shot of 300, and a favorable chance of 220 2/3 this season.
Trump gives cheering speech in West Virginia
The President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while at the same time speaking about the importance of the Republic's turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It’s a big event that I’m not running for, but I’m actually running for, and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely dreadful extremist group of democrats, you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power by whatever means. You'll see their wickedness and filthy play.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross for power and control. All they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission to “resist and prevent”.
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hateful, mean, vile, and liar."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Legal Committee, who was shouting out loud in the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait, that was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a great association.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour Members to be told that you are not welcome, and all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because of her strong support for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the judges criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are curiously similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of my eight-year local Labour MEP with the Friday evening General Assembly meetings is exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the case for most meetings today, and the promise to be “kinder and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed to determine who is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and a co-worker with whom I thought I had shared similar political views in the past was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I publicly stand up, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by a condemnation on social media, encouraging my removal, ignoring party politics, and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
It is not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my co-workers, because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those collaborators who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views in this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a large association, and with every “distrust” initiative or change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve been given a lot of advice to keep my head down, talk less, and “then everything would be fine.”
But that’s not what I came to do in politics.
Since the moment I joined the Labour Party as a schoolchild 32 years ago, motivated by the Thatcher government’s negligence that had literally left my large school classroom on the brink of collapse, I have tried to speak out for better public services to those most in need, acting both as a member of the local council and as a minister of government.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last elections.
There is no way anyone in Nottingham East could get confused about my political views or areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether or not they belong to the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from working for what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: the invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the final result somewhat, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully fun Tennent First League game.
They are now the only unmatched team in the top ten of the table.
In the end, it was a high level of team protection and better risk-taking that led the home team to victory and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “I respect Ayr, they used their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a lead, but a yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was handed over to the Warriors, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot passed a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty strike just before the end of the half, reaching a 17–5 position in a single event at the end of the half in favor of Ayr.
But Melrose successfully started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, taken over by Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken away on a stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead even further thanks to a test conducted by Stafford McDowall and broadcast by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but once again Melrose player Bruce Colvine paid for failing to pass the test after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing on the home field regained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind the advancing Ayris.
Climo passed the ball on, as he did almost immediately after resuming the game, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong in the box and sent the sideguard Gregor Henry away in the fifth attempt of the home field playing team.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to step into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a recognized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a BBC television series that he writes and plays alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow’s “blooming restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Borderless Bolivia hopes the Court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags are waving above the official buildings.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have a slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it.”
In a completely maritime Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of momentum, unity and calm, and of course the country expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are watching the decision of the International Court on the big screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of intermittent talks to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake with Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, think that the court will probably not vote in favor of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up Chilean territory and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice will be taken just six months after hearing the final statements suggests that the case was not a “complicated one,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And, further away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the past four years may have worsened the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent eloquence has lost all of Chile’s remaining benevolence, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unnecessarily swift.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile” and “ending 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue to express political resentment.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not get rid of nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the pledges that rival leaders made to each other during the Singapore summit.
He comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be re-starting a deadlock nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was an aerial castle, believing that the US’s continued restrictions and refusal to declare an end to the war with Korea would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang seriously intends to give up arms, which the state probably sees as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Bring Viewers a Massive Series of Headgears Bringed to Buyers on Shopping Streets in the Neighbourhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought on stage a series of super-large headgear during their 2019 summer season that dazzled Paris Fashion Week.
Tall and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning creations to the fashion loops.
Valentino’s top work was an over-proposed beige hat covering the heads of the models, decorated with a wide rim resembling the feathers.
Other extremely large items of clothing included watermelon jeweled, a wizarding hat, and even pineapple, but they are not intended to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it exactly at the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had sewn together mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than they did in high fashion.
One part of the work resembled a diving suit with an air tube and glasses, while the other part resembled a melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the giant fashion snaps, you'll be lucky.
Fashion gurus predict that super-large headgear can reach the shopping streets near you.
The super-sized hats come right behind La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide straw hat seen on the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created the largely impractical hat that was thrown into social media sent another great work to the fashion openings – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the bikini model that wears it.
Dark orange raffia bag with raffia fringes and white leather sling was the top piece of the 2019 summer collection by Jacquemus La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for super-large garments.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for the world’s citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence rankings and this continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students studying throughout Scotland, and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best service to their students and their parents.
The purpose of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a sector of education that is able to design and implement a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we see that modern languages continue to be well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will reach his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s recent exam results show that at the top of the tables are the languages with the highest exam pass rate among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students scored A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choices of subjects are included in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17% of respondents found a lack of language skills among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find workers for job vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future jobs.
As more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choices made, acquiring a second language will give a person a real advantage in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens immediately gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage of speakers was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, funding language learning is important for today’s children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
Different languages are taught in every school in Scotland.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the option of choosing between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills to succeed no matter what the future brings.
It can no longer be denied that, in a globalising business environment, languages are crucial for the future of a country, and therefore this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication skills".
Private schools continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Eager fans will no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes of his play is still to be determined.
“It’s over one and under 48,” Walton Lakers said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm up," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Election Campaign Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start his campaign campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first campaign event out of five scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the approval vote will stand until Trump elects whom to appoint to a vacant post at the Supreme Court, he will seek to increase support for the forthcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. East Coast Time.
Trump’s West Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which became tense in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct. At the same time, the Senate’s approval vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
However, the main purpose of the campaign series is to help rekindle the momentum of the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump’s campaign manager said that the goal of these five events next week is “to excite volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Controlling Congress is so important to the president’s agenda that Trump is going to dive into as many states as possible during the fast-paced election campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who did not want to mention his name, told Reuters.
This evening’s campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered in the media in Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
This Saturday is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the rankings based on polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to boost her performance,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is struggling to compete, keeping high hopes ahead of Sunday’s solo games
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday afternoon, the games were probably just what Ryder Cup needed.
Fluctuating the turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one here.
Where do you think the turning point is now?
"They led with six points, which has now become four, so I think I can see that as a small turning point," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, that is clear, because it is controlled by four points and there are 12 more points in play.
"Americans feel they don't have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth has been stunning on both the tie and the grind and sets an example.
These victories from the throat became louder and louder with each turn, shading the decisive putt that would have led to the tie of the fourth match after he and Thomas were down with the two of them.
His putt, who won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cry, indicating his belief that the Americans weren't out of the competition yet.
"You just have to be more focused and worry about your match," Spieth said.
That’s all the players can do.
Eighteen holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas after the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange, but beloved couple is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t beat a bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at nine.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into and out of the noisy crowd reinforces the opinion that the players who will compete on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there will be no better player to confirm a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably in different holes at the same time.
However, talk about the glory of Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero this morning, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the first nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep that they had no hope of getting out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and paired games are extremely engaging to watch from the close due to the interaction between pairs, advice given to each other, missed advice, and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken the lead with a strong lead for the last day, but this Quartet session has shown that the US team has a nerve to fight in which some, especially Americans, are skeptical.
Europe to lead the Ryder Cup 10–6 on the last day
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will take a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday’s four-ball and doubles.
The excellent duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led Tiger Woods in two victories to raise their score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who bet on preserving the lost cup at Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the American side after failing in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the doubles, winning two games, but they could not compensate for the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's half will need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after this dim weekend, they are the second couple in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games.
After destroying four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau even more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now lost his 29 four-balls and 19 doubles, losing seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who had rested as a four-ball in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in a doubles match, defeating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe failed to do so, even though the competition was held in a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Saturday.
They secured a 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter in a four-ball win, returning later and defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in doubles 4-3, having lost two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team come back from a four-point deficit by going to singles, although as owners, Furyk's half only needs a draw to maintain the cup.
Although being in second place for two days, after Sunday’s counterattack, they seem to be failing.
North Korea says “no way” they will not unilaterally disarm themselves because of a lack of trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions exacerbated their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and pledging not to disseminate nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we don’t see the United States responding,” he said.
Without trusting the United States, our country has no security security and, under such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, on the basis of which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes step-by-step steps, in his statement it seemed important that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move towards “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of the stringent international restrictions on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for 'first-ever abandonment of nuclear weapons' and is increasing the pressure of restrictions to achieve their goal by forcing, even opposing, the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The notion that restrictions push us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continued restrictions will exacerbate our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader underlined earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were one of the parties to the nuclear arms issue, and not the United States, the issue of nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s speech drastically differed from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that turning to the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but added that there is still much to be done and that restrictions must remain in place until North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “We must continue enforcing the Security Council’s restrictions vigorously and unsuccessfully until we can fully and definitively confirm the cessation of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to obstruct the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met in Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, after which he condemned North Korea for "gangster-like demands" in just a few hours.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missiles and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that by "appropriate measures" he meant Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course in which students need to sleep more to combat the growing aggressive culture of learning through night-long learning marathons that are rich in caffeine.
Students who love the academicism of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, believes this course is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told about this now, in my last year of school?’
“She said no one ever told her the importance of sleep — it made me feel bad,” she told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced to the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes as well as to improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health at the University, said the university had decided to take a course after it found that students were severely deprived of sleep during the working week.
The one-hour course covers a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, explaining the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance and the importance of the established bedtime practice.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interacting symbols encourages participants to think about their daily established practice.
“We know that this does not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Czeisler added.
According to him, there is still pride in the nocturnal learning marathons, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps against weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain into a hunger regime, making the person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler set up a course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to help create a university-wide course.
As a next step, he would like all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set the alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” generated by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this could damage their daytime rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game result when Dolly Menga, sent by Steven Gerrard from the side, won a 1-0 victory over Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to win their first guest win since February, when they defeated 4-1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, lagging eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' poor readiness was unable to recover.
The Rangers are placed in sixth place, Livingston ascends to third place with only one goal down against Hibernian.
For the Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, as their attacker Calum Spence needed treatment for a head wound after being hit with an apparently thrown object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that led to the Ayr and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, moved on with the same Livi 11, who scored a point on the Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored in the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the quarterback did not take his chance.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free stroke then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arc rear post.
The Rangers gained control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute game, but judge Steven Thomson did not accept the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot or Ovie Ejaria's event.
While Liv’s 34th minute opening strike may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to contain Jacobs' deep hard performance.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher scored the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and chose Menga, who simply completed the plan.
Gerrard acted during the break, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. This trade almost paid off when the wingman split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his place to block.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have advanced his leadership in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow struck a large arc from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again applied for a penalty shot when he drove Jacobs, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and READING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Counter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger's Counter also became the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado's Clocks, where they were starring seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, you can hear the pounding of atoms released from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Don’t say it, it’s just spilling!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to 'See' Cheat Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to 'See' and Kill Cheat Cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cheating cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying these cells in the laboratory
They can then “see” a common protein for many cancers and are injected back
The study’s vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect cheating cells had ovarian cancer gone away for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to allow them to ‘see’ a protein that has spread to various HER2 cancers, and then injected back into them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our findings show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started as a Trump-supporting tribe by wearing a hat on SNL live.
It didn't go very well.
In the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West heard a defamatory whistleblower after his confused speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same position in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great," he began to groan against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, isn’t he a racist?’
“If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrities joked about Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about alleged sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
While the show didn’t air, West’s noisy scenes were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West's post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had quite a hard time with his hat.
“They played me behind the scenes.
They said I wouldn't go in there with a hat on.
They've been teasing me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the drowned place? I’m putting on my Superman cape because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments triggered the anger of viewers at least twice and seemed to embarrass the SNL team. According to Variety, one person published: “The whole studio remained deadly silent.”
West had been introduced to the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande after her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West astonished many with the song “I Love It,” which at the time of its performance looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one brave soul: THANK YOU FOR NOT COMBATING THE MOST PEOPLE.”
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “who he is, and it’s absolutely amazing.”
"But I chose NOT to award (by buying my music or clothing or supporting his 'art') someone who, in my opinion, believes and spreads a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was now "former Kanye West."
She is not the first singer to change her performer name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly departed musical legend Prince, who changed his name into a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Magistrates in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington does not approve of the masculinity of the twig
Kit Harington is known for his blazing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) sets aside the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of fang masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her co-husband Rose Leslie (31) in the Game of Thrones, admitted that she felt “quite strongly” that this problem needed attention.
“I personally feel pretty strongly right now that we’ve gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in the masculinity of the fang, as it shows superman characters.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be exactly what they want to be men.
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something has gone wrong for the kids.”
In the poll, he also admitted that after the end of the series next summer he would never take part in any of the sequels to the Game of Thrones, saying he was "on the side of his battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit participates in Sam Shepard's revival of True West, a story about the filmmaker and his kidnapper brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing about the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen dramatically to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
In some parts of China , HIV was mainly transmitted by blood transfusions .
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly high.
Because of the country’s old-fashioned values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are associated with inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of employee GOP senator’s data, saying it is “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that her employee had posted personal details of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being disseminated by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more despicable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and released membership information for an employee under Waters, Hill said.
"This unfounded statement is a complete and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are compromised by these fraudulent and false claims, are not in any way responsible for this leak.
This unfounded statement is a complete and irrefutable lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial comes from anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has feelings that are inappropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t get angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who will run for Waters in the mid-term election, tweeted.
“It’s important when it comes to truth,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent allegations.”
"We will do everything we can to find out the perpetrators," he continued, "and make them legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Underequipped Rowan Atkinson's Spy Parody
Nowadays, it is customary to search for the meanings of Brexit in all new British films, and this seems particularly appropriate in Johnny English’s parody series – which began with Johnny English in 2003 and succeeded Johnny English Reborn in 2011 – in revival.
Is it humorous to joke about yourself about how obviously stupid we are in the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, punchy-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things once again in his clumsy way — and that this wide-ranging comedy creation is meant for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, he is a secret agent who, despite his oddly pretentious smoothie glamor, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean, and a little character who gave the tone to Chariots of Fire’s theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
It’s also based on the character’s traveler and international mystery Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving nothing but chaos behind.
There are only one or two pleasant moments in this latest JE film.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter as he wore a medieval armor and the helicopter's swings slammed at his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy themselves with confidence.
It seems that this humor is more for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English’s cunning adventures are not as resourceful and focused as Atkinson’s silent movies Beanina.
At the moment, the assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is forever topical.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, exposing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thus making a huge disappointment for a local agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is a festive and troubled character who suffers the burden of political impopularity: Emma Thompson does this teresa-may character perfectly, but there is not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at a fancy institution, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of great places where English offers a School of Rock-like spy school.
English is sent back to Whitehall for emergency information and reunited with his former long-time partner, Bough, who is re-played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraces of Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, meeting the beautiful Femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurõlenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the hands of a dangerously charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve all of Britain’s computer problems: the unhappy Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their grotesque odyssey: hiding as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly restraining the luxury yacht of Volta; and English launches a real mess as she tries to use a virtual reality headset to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as cute and hurried as it is, the whole thing has the taste of children's TV.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I caught myself wondering: does the British film industry really have a role to give Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
Labour denies a plan where British workers work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has been considering a ground-breaking plan that requires British workers to work four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
The party wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings they received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to employees, giving them an additional day off.
That way, employees would have a three-day weekend — but they would get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda, and so it is intended to incline the state to the benefit of the workers.
Thursday’s working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is assumed that a review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“It doesn’t happen overnight, but the Thursday working week is an endeavor that fits in with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of both workers and with the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Greens also promised a Thursday working week during their 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this effort.
A Labour spokesman said: “Fourth-day work week is not party politics and the party does not discuss it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to clarify his vision of a socialist shift in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power from the "faceted managers" and "profit-servants" of utilities.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not get back all of their holdings, as the Labour Party could make “deductions” in relation to perceived misdemeanours.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and set up participatory equity funds to give 10% of private company equity to employees, instead of giving annual bonuses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court candidacy by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could influence the cessation of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, 60 Minutes co-star Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to the interrogation. I said I’ve spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, confident and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be rock-hard.
“I am confident in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and that can only be changed by bomb news,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And not all whom he has named could confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual music event is hosted by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has hugely impressive celebrity participation and the same impressive goal: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now, the seventh Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn area not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers who hope to end poverty by steadily increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an email to some of the world’s leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it’s still 12 years away from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to insist on action, or is it just another click-and-click buzz where people feel like they’re doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters, pursuing a variety of goals.
According to this, these measures have helped global leaders communicate more than <0x24>37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and communications resulting from their activities, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based Investors and Employers Partnership, The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “helping children take full advantage of their potential,” promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a London concert in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK calling for improvements in mother and child nutrition, the government announced a funding project for The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website, which asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s a long and difficult road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers who will perform at this year’s New York event, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy’s “barrier” to prevent Russia’s energy exports
According to Washington Examiner, Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent Russia from hitting the energy market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when called upon by a legitimate government, is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity to use our Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organization that represents the US's "energy consumer voice".
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and fuel replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to push out the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, Trump said, turned Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been backfired by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industries (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president.
At Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the First Lady,” he said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s actions in the Town Hall, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run for office in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "probably" Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of this approach.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38% in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin Cites Track Palin’s PTSD At Donald Trump’s Gathering
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
“What my son is going through, what he’s going to experience when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s gathering in Tulsa, Oktahama.
Palin called the arrest of his son "the elephant in the room" and said in relation to his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back tempered, they come back wondering if there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other military personnel have given to the state."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett said he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference in a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun in a state of drunkenness.
18 states and the Columbia region challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 countries and regions issued a brief statement from court lovers in Washington on Friday to support a challenging policy on asylum seekers, NBC News said.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions suitis, proposed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against Union policy, has not been published.
The woman said her accomplice “and her violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials refused to accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom gangs and domestic violence are a major problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeals for Immigrants, which allowed undocumented migrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “will violate national, Union and international law for decades.”
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle," the court said in a brief statement.
In a brief statement, the lawyers also claimed that banning immigrants from entering the U.S. is damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertaining rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fevered baby boy at the Palu City Evacuation Centre.
“Every minute, new people arrive in the ambulance.
There is not enough clean water.”
The residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out the stuff they had lost and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, struggling with a broken back and upper arm, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a strong earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“I didn’t have time to save myself.
I think I was squeezed against the wall in the ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "harassment with incitement advertisements"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad under the U.S. daily news about the mutual daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited an add-on paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the state's largest newspaper, after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 US Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other’s import tariffs are adjusted.
China’s countermeasures at the outset of the tariff war were designed to target states like Iowa’s exporters because they supported Trump’s Republican parties, experts from China and the US have explained.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor Terry Branstad, China’s largest exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing incitement advertisements in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American freedom of expression and free press practice by putting its paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited votes in the Beijing street kiosk and there are no real differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but did not say what newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans will alienate female voters before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual assaults, analysts have warned they will see a setback during the upcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been on the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move on with the vote.
These things can't be taken back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Science at Syracuse University, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute effort to investigate the FBI was enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for the MoveOn Progressive Group, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated “November is Coming!” at a demonstration in their Senate hallway as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to move on with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic zeal and internal conviction are getting out of schedule,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among suburban female voters and 18- to 29-year-old younger voters who dislike the president and often abstain from voting.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a setback as Republicans asserted to move forward.
"It has become very confusing for the GOP," former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether or not Kavanaugh will be put in office, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated him,” said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided, believing in Ford and Kavanaugh after the testimonies, but a little more in supporting the first.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41% of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him her genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet that will rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend Inrupt is the company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are given access to the information.
In an extraordinary interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "government of the world."
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes this personal online database unique is that the user can choose who gets access to this information.
The company refers to this as “the granting of personal authority through data”.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is for the company to bring resources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-buyed security platform, some developers hired under contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change when all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A memorial stone to a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross was opened in World War I
The Church of England, the only church to have been crucified during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought out his badge of honour on 29 September 1918 in the attacks of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper’s bullet and did not know he had received the highest British military decoration.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "brilliantly symbolic" if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and a bullet from rifles and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and pushed it forward with the "biggest gallant" before he hurried alone to one machine gun and struck three opponents unconscious.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - when there was only a little over a month left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to repeat, but for which I’ll always be grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Bath, placed the wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's English youth band.
Michael Vann said he was “very honored to be a part of this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated.”
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but only saw Pig Peppa
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching the Bellator 206, but you’re not even shown the main event.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six from the main map, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK all night long.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight each other, UK viewers kept their mouths shut because Pig Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not enthusiastic about it, especially those who had stayed awake until early hours to see the fight.
One fan tweeted that the transition to a children's comic book was "something painful."
"It's government regulation that at 6:00 a.m., the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, explained when asked about the transfer.
"Pig Peppa, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they plan to work on their schedule to take more into account UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about the replay now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s Sunday morning at 6:00, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical disruption.
But it wasn’t, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we’re showing five – as we usually do – we tried to offer more to the fans and we just went over time.
This is a difficult situation.”
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Undervalued” About Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality—but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone is like him.”
While attending Lauren Laverne’s Radio 4 on Desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Becoming a parent also changed his attitude to winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You get the usual long-term host Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to her illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up, he felt inferior to others because it wasn't socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls.
He said, “Until today, these feelings of not being worthy and feeling different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” and didn’t disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Bronze Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly-acclaimed LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky enough to be able to live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The triple world champion said falling in love with a man -- U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "hit him in surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much when you’re young—he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later—it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said her father did not agree to die, and one of the last things she asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 — because she wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you can’t sit in the front row, because by then you won’t be there,’” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he had actually stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her first choice of songs -- Heather Small's Proud -- which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was kicked out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for the record 12th time in a biennial event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's doubles and four-ball.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has often been for the U.S., the five-time winner split his day into two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hope of improving it.
Never the most direct hitter, even at the height of his career, a 48-year-old is particularly suited to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long, rough trail constantly punishes missed hits.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinar on Sunday, his ninth race, who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
When the Americans, who are behind the start of the 12 singles with four points, start hot, Mickelson’s race can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but had little else to add.
"He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and has given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but it went that way, and we had to go that way.
He wants to be outside, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record as the most attended Ryder Cup player on Sunday.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has made an additional spiritual contribution to the team.
"He's funny, he's ridiculous, he's funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room," he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going up against him this week and it was great to see that.
They offer more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big lead could soon disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the great leadership of the last day of the Ryder Cup at the start of single games can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane made his public appearance at the 1997 Valderrama, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, he held a five-point lead over the Americans, but when he reached the finish line, it was drastically reduced, winning only 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2: 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You even remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great success in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, that victory came very close," Bjorn said after winning Class of 2018 5:3 on Friday and yesterday's 10:6 at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the scores.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so we focus on that.
“I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who our opponents are – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush things forward.
Tomorrow, there will be completely new obstacles.
Tomorrow it will be personal, and so it will be something else.
It’s nice to be with your opponent when things are going well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you’re leaving your partner, he’s going to have to go and do it himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will personally act better than their opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of Brookline's winning team before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all of their game into the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start hot, like Brookline and like Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle races.
“We will set our team accordingly and put the boys on the pitch in a way that we feel will be a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race and he is best off against Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the race.
"I put my boys in that order because I think that's how we're properly covered," Bjorn said.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest high-speed sailboat of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing obsolete warships during the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, local media said.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate pilot vessel, the new high-speed sailing vessel of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class high-speed sailboats.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as radar, infrared and audible signal reduction.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods – the latest fast sailboats should be able to be dispatched from the home port for up to two years.
Constant delays mean, however, that state-of-the-art warships - which promise to strengthen Germany's power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The failed F125 sailboat appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware shortcomings" that rendered the warship unusable if it had been used on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships were managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce of the older Bremen-class high-speed sailors.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the navy's ability to incorporate future innovations.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, weighing 7,000 tons, is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including training the team, becomes a problem.
It is said to amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the newer high-speed sailboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy had actually run out of "ready-to-remove ships".
The official said that this topic has grown like a snowball over time because old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the high-speed sailors of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
A study by Scots National Trust scientists tracks conventional and soprano chicks in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field studies using handheld sensors.
A competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bat calls and the activity of the species.
A map and report of habitats is then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS nature conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, bat populations have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and the chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But due to their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo positioning techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only special bat reserve in the Threave area in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species in Scotland live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is an ideal territory for them.
"In Threave, we have a large area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there’s still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we’re doing here and in other areas will help us better understand what they need.”
He stresses the importance of bat control before starting maintenance activities on the property, as the unintended destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and their killing, disturbing or destroying is illegal.
Scottish Officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Leather Mouse Conservation Association has encouraged the public to help.
He said, “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers seek to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “would like to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>330,643.10 to the woman to keep her out of the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
On Instagram, Ronaldo (33) reported that his 142 million followers were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and I'm fine," the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for “an unacceptable suspicion of privacy.”
Christian Schertz, an attorney at law, said the player was seeking compensation for “moral damage that is proportionate to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he allegedly was raped, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was “99 percent a good man,” of whom “one percent fails.”
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple’s sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she feared “retribution” and was concerned about “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman now says she is now trying to refute the solution as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with the giant Juve.
Brexit: UK may regret car manufacturers leaving forever
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's automotive industry leader after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at a plant near Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border crossing stalls without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces vehicles in Toyota Auris and Avens, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also feared leaving the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit deal.
Toyota’s production line operates as needed, with spare parts coming from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border that, according to industry, could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, and production would have to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that allows us to do what we want and not only take advantage of the current success, but of the full opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Evidence not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Unite union spokesman Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from experience that if jobs disappear, they won’t come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the fight against the highest ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference in the Russian elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wiretap tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein did not confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House to announce his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave hours.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Rosenstein said: “This date hasn’t been set yet, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account everything that’s going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and I’ll keep the press informed, as always.”
Some journalists would contest this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not caused by deliberately disappointing TV journalists, although he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," he said, without adding any evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
Questioning hours continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do a lot of that, and you’ve seen how we’ve done it in the last couple of weeks, so it’s going to be during a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated, perhaps, why, having been freelance and sometimes odd-looking before gathering in front of journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working for Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wishing them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter after less than six months left before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of its established status for EU citizens employed in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Negotiations on the resignation between the UK and the EU have continued this summer, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury and defeat on Saturday 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He fell to his side and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while on the side before he was placed on a stretcher and moved away from the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV – Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie’s operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there were no details about the type/scope of the injury yet, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Red-shirted second-year student Abercrombie spent her first season in Tennessee State after crossing Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreigners must pay higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreigners are required to pay higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This move disarms Corbyn’s aspiration to attract young voters
The stamp duty applies to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreigners will have to pay a higher temple tax rate when they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to defuse Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp duty tax is imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, directing additional money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The surcharge – which is in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on the second home and on-lease purchases – can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this movement to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the property purchased in London belongs to non-U.K. residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when buying housing.
Many of the country’s wealthy regions – especially the capital – have become “ghost cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and urged May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to rectify Britain’s “housing-related shame.”
Corbyn has announced eye-catching housing reforms, including rent control and an end to the harassment of innocent people.
It also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, I promised that as Prime Minister I would commit to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as it is for companies abroad to buy homes, as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too distant and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderlan leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish (42) welcomes the challenge of reviving North-East, which is currently third in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached a B-class and that was the end of it," Ross told the BBC Scotland show Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my dad watching Scotland in Hampden and it’s always something that’s pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I manage the club successfully.”
Ross’s predecessors as Sunderland managers have been Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear of such great and well-known names, having previously endured in both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment is if I can bring this club to the Champions League.”
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I see myself as successful only if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for just three years, previously serving as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months as Head of Hearts.
He then helped Alloale recover from falling to the third level and made St Mirren's lowest position the next championship winner.
And Ross says he’s feeling more comfortable now than he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic during his career.
"It was a real crossroads," he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
“I really thought that driving was better for me than playing.
It feels weird because I did it, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some of the highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I’m still experiencing this in the light of the stress and pressure of my work, but the management just feels more right.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I do. I feel more comfortable now than I've ever felt in adulthood."

According to a study, the best time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of British struggling pubs, but greater pressure has arisen on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a spokesman for CGA, said: “The continuing sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, when pubs’ revenues grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
Restaurant trade, which decreased by 1.8% in June, deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully, and restaurants trying to please the poorest.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, while food sales fell by three percent.”
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
A long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve experienced in August will provide some of the necessary relief.”
The total growth in pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand-related agencies.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found growth of “false Insta” leaves
News Increases Fear of Posting Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students said they have a “master account” to show their parents
The study found that one in five children, some of them only 11 years old, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasts found a noticeable increase in “false Insta” accounts (link to photo sharing page Instagram).
The news heightened the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “master account” that was designed to show parents as well as made acceptable to themselves.
One discoverer of a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager inviting others to rape her.
The Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s annoying to see so many teenagers tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to Become Scottish Athletics Board Speaker
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors’ Annual Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from being invited to his leadership," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesman for the athletes and I hope to be able to make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
The American who won four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200m and 400m, and now frequently shares his opinion on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transitory ischaemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover, and if so, to what extent.
I’ve done a lot of hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising comparing women to cows divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has divided the internet into two camps with advertising that compares a nursing mother to dairy cows.
According to reports, to mark the presentation of “the world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer-oriented technology company Elvie released a similar ad to an ironic music video to showcase the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who want to live.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows and sing, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see my tail,” and “If you didn’t notice, they’re not udders, they’re my breasts.”
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, advertising on the company’s Facebook page has sparked dissent on the Internet.
Viewers of the video with 77,000 views and thousands of comments disagree. Many of them say it illuminates the dairy industry behind the tent.
“Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that their babies are stolen days after birth.”

Another commentator said: “It is understandably traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who can keep babies?"
Somebody added: "Completely inconceivable advertising."
Some of them are in favor of advertising, but one woman said the story was super fun.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I still breastfed.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement (often at work or in the bathroom) for mothers pumping and feeling like cows.
This advertisement does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all been stabbed in dancing bra with not striking pumps.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the saying that many women pumping breast milk feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and does not stand out as a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold children, and even walk outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating introduction.
By comparing female expression with dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children with designer Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on the stage.
Thousands of Children of Migrants Silently Go to Tent Camp at Texas Border
The number of children of migrants arrested has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administrator have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are documented immigrants and have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country by claiming custody of the child.
The threat increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, admitted to Congress last week that the agency had arrested a dozen people who had requested financial support for minors who were not accompanying them.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of sponsors or members of the sponsor household are illegally staying in the country, and a large number of them have criminal backgrounds.
So we will continue to pursue them,” Mr. Albence said.
To deal more quickly with children, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested. Previously, the shelter, according to employees, was 60 days away.
Many defend their legal content in front of the immigration judge by videoconferencing, rather than coming.
Those who are unfit for release will be promptly expelled from the country.
According to asylum workers, and according to system reports published in recent months, the longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent protests or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulties may be overlooked due to size.
They added that moving children to tent towns without leaving enough time to get used to feelings or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, with which many are already struggling.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulayem called on Syrian refugees to return home after eight years of war.
According to Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism, and they are being dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Moualem claimed that Syria’s “war on terror is almost over” and that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any foreign force illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugees of war, Moualem said the conditions for their return were appropriate, and he blamed the spread of unreasonable fears that prevented the arrival of refugees in some Western countries.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that’s just a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which sets up the Idlib buffer zone as the last rebel base, has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale raid by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement contains “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action will hit jihadist fighters, including those of the Nusra Front, who are “destroyed”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convince a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections in the near future.
Moualem called for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warning against interference.
Why Trump is Elected to a Second Legislature
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the dismissal and scandal have not previously terminated his presidency, as liberal viewers probably want.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most exciting ending of the presidency!”
At the moment, viewers do not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled, reaching over 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the peak hour. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has increased. The 3.5 million cable viewers on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” have held its rating high during the main evening news.
"It's the tension we're involved in because we don't understand it," the head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor said about the secretary of government who will become president if the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers the 2016 pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The leader told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He said he was making me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said to me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington’s rumors could be fatal to Roe v. Wade’s future and to the immigrant families and the global economy that want to reunite.
Avoiding the subject is only a luxury for viewers in a privileged position.
But a six-hour expert talk show that talks about Bob Woodward’s “in-depth background check” for his book Fear and Paul Manafort’s 13,225,73<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> ostrich-skinned citizen Bomber jacket (the Washington Post said it was a “excessively self-confidence-inspiring garment”) and Stormy Daniels’ backthoughts.
I will never watch Super Mario again with the same feeling.
"One of his actions, which may seem like a reality show, is that he shares something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series, with the alternating actors of Trump's performance and the pyramids of the day's schedule (a quarrel with the NFL, praise to Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single moment or you're out of time.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees Celsius at his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he had sneaked into the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't help but watch Brett Kavanaugh face the Senate's Justice Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember how we used to do all kinds of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Elsewhere, cash flow moves to the fiercest mid-term election in the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is making a cash flow thanks to the reorganization of the congress area, bringing two incumbents to the same spot.
As a result, Conor Lamb of the Democratic Republic of Pittsburgh, who won a seat in the second district in the extraordinary elections last spring, was re-elected.
Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous Pennsylvania District 12, which largely coincides with the new 17.
The maps were changed following a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, which is why the old districts were divided into unconstitutional electoral districts, favoring Republicans.
The new 17th elections have triggered a campaign where the finance departments of the largest political parties trump themselves with money - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a short victory in the much-regarded March 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania emergency elections.
The Republican has been doing this for decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then withdrawn
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned the Panama Hotel until the partners kicked out the Trump company’s administration team.
Foreign Ministry officials in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama have decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission, after ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had recently ceased to support Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was to be punished, which in 2017 received <0x24>140 million in American aid, including for drug surveillance, development and economic stimulus.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment rate and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity to organise a follow-up to a similar meeting last year seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and end the discussion on any El Salvador sanctions.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now being criticized for speaking at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the government's positions.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further harsh announcements or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on a request for anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the demand for anonymity.
Educational history
Next, special prosecutor Robert Mueller may publish a report on Trump’s possible administration of justice, for which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to report back to this institution as if he were going to talk to voters and perhaps even his peer judges again.
There are many, however, and I do not want to point out that the removal of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all need to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented and supported Czechoslovakia at Münich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-year massacres.
History runs around such turning points, and the ruthless march of democracy comes closer or is delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he made a secret recording proposal for the president last year and speculated about his unfitness for the post.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to react if the FBI’s newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the central elections if Trump should be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz who once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me the light of the candles of the Sabbath on a table with a sledgehammer.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over Australia, following an impressive tie earlier this month against Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the European League G-Group.
The knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before a game that ended with a 2-fold against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarrea has a strong opponent,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
"Hopefully we'll get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of the people, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, because of that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling inside.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the workout is good.
Hopefully we can now move on, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women are unable to sleep due to fears related to pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
That, however, should be the starting point.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for caring if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of cost.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options in relation to long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance – as long as you have the money you need.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the sprouts.
Get yourself a health service proxy to determine a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your request at a time when you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider a trustee in relation to your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write these things down so that you are ready when needed.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin explained.
What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?

In his 40s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting as an incident at around 2:30 p.m.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths continues to rise.
Because of the disconnection, rescuers have received no information from the Donggala Regent north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located along a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regents is an area stretching over 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is an administrative district under the authority of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, mainly concentrated in Morowal, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is sismically located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck the southernmost inhabited island of Java in Indonesia, creating a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An area near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, was hit by a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatra - the island of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regent in Aceh, sowing devastation and panic, reminding people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami devastation.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report related to domestic violence, and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when the woman tried to report the alleged crimes to the police, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su’s criminal investigation facility and is being held under <0x24>500 unsecured bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “not guilty under any circumstances,” the news network said.
Palin faces three grade A misdemeanours, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanour, which is punishable by one day imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police.
The case is currently being discussed in the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of home assault, interference with domestic violence reports and possession of a gun, all in a state of drunkenness.
His girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami after earthquake: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu.
NYC Federal Prosecutors Request Rare Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of being involved in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This rare sentence has not been executed for federal crime committed since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a cycling road along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the Death Penalty Notice filed in the south of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious bodily injuries.
Both cases are potentially subject to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included eight murder charges along with blackmail, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “intensive planning and deliberation,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s actions as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last death of the New York Southern District Court.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed was in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in New York in 1953, when a couple were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he had told investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos viewed from his phone.
Police said he also wanted the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
On the 22-point charge, he has not pledged himself guilty.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s national defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the ruling.
“In our view, the decision to apply for the death penalty extends the trauma of all concerned, instead of a life imprisonment without the possibility of acquittal,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MEP said Nigel Farage should be appointed to lead Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army” during today’s protest at the Tory Conference.
A former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics because one of Theresa May’s own parliamentarians suggested she lead the negotiations with the EU.
During a march in Birmingham, Conservative House of Commons member Peter Bone said the UK "would have been out by now" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
However, Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling her deeply divided ranks, highlighted by the Conservatives in favor of staying, joining the city in their anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track in the midst of Brexit supporters, ice-breakers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite a retaliation and force Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and “chaos.”
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihul that he wanted “to abandon the Chequers plan.”
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“We’d be outside by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: “I stand out for Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan.”
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory’s Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I’ll just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers’ plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s unpopular with our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and elect us.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians at the summit had to be “hot” if they were to betray the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let that happen.”
He added: “I want you to make our political class, who are on the brink of Brexit betrayal, uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory over Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the ice marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering in the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved the slogans of “Tories Against Brexit” after the group was formed this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues that came to their party’s application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can get the IT systems in place and bring all the technology to Canada and more, smooth border crossing, cross-border trade without restrictions to Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the next election in November against GOP National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump’s deputy chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that he may be opposed to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the Town Hall after Trump took office.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, that is, the First Lady,” Warren said.
The shooting of LSU Sims was arrested.
LA police in Baton Rouge on Saturday said the suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims had been arrested.
Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference around 11 a.m.
They released a video of Friday’s shooting, asking for help in identifying the man they saw in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told a news outlet on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident at East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which were in the initial league, an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and took 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team counting gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday in front of Lewis Hamilton that Mercedes team rankings play a major role in racing.
Bottas had a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position for the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the booth stops and left the back of the Hamilton team in heavy traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the booth stop later in the ring and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to drive after being side by side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left him free to pass the inner side after an attempt to defend it by a double move on the third bend.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round for his 21-year-old birthday.
He then headed the race most of the time, driving to the finish with the tires rolling and passed Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He eventually drove to the pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to increase his speed in the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a hard day because Valtteri did a good job all week and was a real gentleman bypassing me.
“The team has done a great job to have one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday gathering over the incident that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford’s testimony directly to the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate, which showed that people were “evil, disgusting, and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening right now that has happened in the Senate in a few days is that you see anger and angry, mean, disgusting and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks that say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer to the question “Did you leak the document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Hold on a second.
Did we leak ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added with the senator’s look.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the allegations against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill said: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep confidentiality, and I did as he requested.”
But his denial did not suit the president, who commented during Saturday’s gathering: “You know, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without selecting resources.
"You see this evil and disgust, and they don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross to get the power and control," he said.
Premier League: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giants Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants in a rematch of Friday's elite league, losing 5:3 to Dundee.
The Giants started the game early with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillieri's goal.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the front before Dwyer took the Giants to lead again.
François Bouchard equalized Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
This was the third loss for the elite Adam Keefe men, who came to Belfast on Friday night to defeat Dundee at 2:1.
It was the fourth match of the season in which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening gate came in 3:35 in the fourth minute with the help of Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in the fast first third at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie score a draw in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would lead before the first break, scoring the second goal of his evening at the end of the first third.
At home, the players gathered again, and Bouchard leveled them again, scoring the goal in the numerical predominance in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen take Dundee's lead at the end of the second trimester, ensuring victory in the final trimester in their team's attack zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
Air traffic controller is dying to save hundreds of people from earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of them missing.
The area is haunted by strong afterthoughts and many people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled the swinging air tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained at work to ensure safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to another major hospital in the city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived.
“We were very sad when we heard about it,” the spokesperson added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the national disaster mitigation agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong has been restricted.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said: "The number of deaths may increase because the bodies of many victims are still in the ruins and have not been recovered."
6-meter waves ravaged the city of Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The ambulance brings new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they can find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready for that?” CNN said.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia airline claims one man missing after lagoon crash
While it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airliner that was piloting the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man has disappeared.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they were unable to find a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately reply to questions concerning the passenger’s details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The exact circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"It's very good," said Jayne.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to wade in the water at wagon height to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he had a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked on the nearby berth also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving air carriers registered with PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
An analyst compiles a schedule for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday closed a re-examination of a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert observer analyzing intelligence.
He showed the jury how he used cell phone call extracts to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said Tellis “lied because my car was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before he died.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis erased Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defendant is scheduled to make his hearing on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to fight the negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from the beginnings of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York babysitter sues for racist message
A New York babysitter sues for discriminatory dismissal after a couple of accidentally received messages from their family in which their mother complained that the babysitter was “another black”.
The couple denies that they are racist compared to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her displeasure when she learned that Giselle Maurice, their new childcare provider, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying, "EIIIIIIIIIIII, ORGANized BLACK."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman was fired after understanding Miss Maurice, claiming that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino to replace her.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple to get the compensation he wants to get for his dismissal in the amount of <0x24>350 a day for the next six months, and the same job he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that look, so do it," he told The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claim that they were racists, saying it was a reasonable move to terminate employment with Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust him after insulting him.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t think of.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists," his wife, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
“But would you allow your children to be held by someone you have been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
"Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from birth and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would you like to meet someone like that?”
It’s not very good,” the banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, public opinion has swiftly condemned the couple on social media, where they are harshly criticized for their behavior and thinking.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Worried About Talking Bears
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of the person who first read it before it was published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He said that his father, inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about his rejection of his job, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was grief-shaded due to his father's death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man and not a proud man,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like when your child accomplishes something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that her daughter was in a very bad condition and that they didn’t believe she would survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tash, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was dead a little while before that, and now all the systems are shutting down.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what would happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
“Nobody knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Postcards of a grieving woman prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have embedded maps on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that her smile would make the whole room shine.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place with his own.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even a friend.
“Don’t shut up, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her mother's death.
“She didn’t say she was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“We noticed a change in her behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the entire family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance while the FBI opens an investigation
“I believed that if we could actually get what he wanted — a limited time and scope study — we might be able to achieve unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” in the midst of a perpetual partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks from now, on November 6th, and if the Republicans do not do as well as expected, they will be markedly weakened in their intentions of getting the man they want to lead the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s military runners are “decreasing” under Kim’s regime
South Korean lawmakers have said the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Convergence, said that compared to the 2011 Army Corps (2706), their number declined last year (1127).
Mr. Park said the key factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of North Koreans have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily-protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China accepts refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back home by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of stalled nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they pledged to work towards a broadly nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of not making any progress.
“Without trust in the United States, our country has no security security, and under such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to be a Supreme Court judge
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temperamentally unfit to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi was interviewed on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I inevitably noticed that if any woman had acted in this way, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to a testimony given by Kavanaugh before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, and when describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed at times and at times remained speechless.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the allegations against him of Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election “a grotesque and coordinated reputational murder” organized by angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was not fit to be a Supreme Court judge because it showed that he was inclined against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would attempt to remove him if Kavanaugh were confirmed, should the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so much – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only fit to be a judge at the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to be in the court where he’s currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court rulings.
"This is not the time for a hysterical biased person to become a judge and expect us to say, 'Isn't it nice?'" Pelosi said.
Women have to wear it.
It is a fair word, months and years of fury, and he will not escape it without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued: “I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere; she said she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a method that was that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly accepted as an expression of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable rage when an older woman — a strict leader I had always feared — grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the staircase.
“Never show yourself crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and that gives them satisfaction.”
Patricia Schroeder, a then Democratic Party congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on a man's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital love story on board the Monkey Business yacht and the campaign ended, deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he shouldn't think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“Seven candidates were already nominated and the last thing they needed was someone else to join.”
Somebody said it was like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was late to raise funds, and he vowed not to run if he didn’t get <0x24>2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to the men, gave her only <0x24>250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he was not launching an official campaign, feelings of gratitude to the people who supported him, irritability to the system that made it difficult to raise funds and turn to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism, overcame him so much that tears came to his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the press’s reaction to him.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot this year, imposing taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs on <0x24>200 billion worth of goods, essentially imposing taxes on half of goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way every time, most recently with tariffs ranging from 5% to 10% on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to shoot the US one shot at a time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink soon.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean yielding to demands, but publicly bow to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing does the right thing, a trade war with the US could support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that cause another country to lose control of the economy is actually much more dangerous than spectators have admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for Refugees
Syria says the country is ready for the refugees to return voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulayem said the situation in the country would improve.
“Currently, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to bring them back to normal.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and because of unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods to return voluntarily.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the country will not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team at Le Golf National in Paris, France, with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who had been on the streak throughout the tournament, scored a tie on Par-3 in 16 waters, handing the victory over to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have scored 5:0:0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was beaten by Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranked Dane in the European team.
World's best player Dustin Johnson beat Englishman Ian Poulter by 2 and 1 to finish the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best-winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold myself back.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It’s the team spirit and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot, Jon Rahm, who won Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“I’m extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career score of 13 : 21 : 3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange stats for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 titles in a major tournament, lagging behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was busy finding fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance: “I’m proud of the guys, they were brave.
There were times this morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players did a great job.
Let's get together, I'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to lift the hat.
We played better.”
New information on water bloom: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a decrease in the overall concentration of blooming algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there have been reports of scattered blooms in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting decreasing concentrations.
The range of water bloom is about 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from Pinellas County to Lee County.
Spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer spots than last week.
Water blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, average concentrations on the coast or offshore have been reported in the county of Pinellas, in the county of Hillsborough, from low to high concentrations on the high seas, in the county of Manatee, from background to high concentrations, in the county of Sarasota, from coastal to high concentrations, in the county of Charlotte, from background to medium concentrations.
There are continuing reports of respiratory irritation from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida last week.
