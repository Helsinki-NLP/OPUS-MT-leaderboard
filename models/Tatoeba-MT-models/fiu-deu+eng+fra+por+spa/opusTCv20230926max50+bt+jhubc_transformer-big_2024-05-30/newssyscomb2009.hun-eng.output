Right-wing populists win 29 percent in Austria
The significant weakening of the two parties of the previous Grand Coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were brought about by the first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Carinthia’s provincial superior, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the most powerful party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the votes, but lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP was even worse, losing nearly 9 percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and the result is literally catastrophic, especially for the early elections of the People’s Party.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to opinion polls.
However, the voters apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current vice-chancellor.
The observers believe that this could be done at an extraordinary meeting of the party chairmanship as early as Monday.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP grand coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received 18 percent of the votes and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> received 11 percent of the votes - at the same time the European Social Democrats expressed their fears about the repetition of the 1999 year, when the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still in agreement with the populists in 2005.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to national politics in Vienna, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party, however, lost some popularity and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four-percent limit and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relations could cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists charged with illegal beetle harvesting could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be some coldening in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister published this in New York following his meeting today with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, there would be some detachment," he said after the meeting, which was carried out on the basis of Czech encouragement.
After the trial, Mukherji said it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction is the case.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best for him to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then he could apply for release on bail and be free to wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the High Court, then it would be possible to acquit him," the chief of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide "competent legal support" to the convict, the Indian minister said.
However, he said the Indian side is already providing them with such assistance.
“Our main interest with India is to maintain the best relationships with many years of tradition.
The Indians acknowledge that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
When asked whether the Indian side had promised to deal with the case, the minister evaded the answer.
"I've already got a lot of promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It approaches the walled electronic map showing Australia and the neighboring sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is about the size of the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is a member of the UN Division of Ocean and Sea Law’s 30-member team.
His boss, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the director of the division, observes the explanation, which he sometimes supplements.
Work and enthusiasm reign here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources, so far barely known.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but there are also unknown living organisms, which may be the key to the development of cancer medicine, for example.
Seabed larger than land
Today, coastal states are intensively seeking new undersea areas.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed in Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1982.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
Such a country shall have the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, we hold that part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental shelf, which is the natural continuation of the subsea continent.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles beyond the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application, which the country submits to the Commission defining the outer borders of the Continental Platform, must be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
So far, the committee has discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Recently, the success of Australia has been echoed in the world, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed area awarded to the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
Profits from the future use of the seabed are expected to be invaluable.
Other countries are constantly submitting their applications.
They may do so within ten years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area declared by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka exaggerating, saying "some of its territories are legally clearly delimited and their regime is contracted."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares this with other countries of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
Under the treaty, the organization, like investors in some other countries, was granted the status of a “pioneer investor” in 1991.
It is licensed to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati in the Pacific.
The area inspected by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, a kind of undersea replica of the Tatras.
"It can be extracted on a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says Pakshi Rajan, another Hindu lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian member of the division, gives an example of another concretion.
It reminds me of a potato or a parchment with magical words that bring the Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the release of the hostage.
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis, and the experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details about the rescue of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to specialists from the German Federal Army, the GSG 9, staff of the German Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Criminal Bureau, as well as logistics experts from the German Technical Service, were at the scene of the rescue.
According to ministry spokesmen Monday evening, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage-takers let their prisoners escape and then fled when they recognized the signs of a violent rescue.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The group, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts, was abducted on 19 September in southern Egypt.
Following the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth along the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until now, the identity of the hostages has remained unclear, as have the details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
The survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
No information has yet been given about when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on an Airbus of the German Air Force.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The U.S. House of Commons overturned, by a small majority, the <0x24>700 billion bailout package proposed for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones has fallen into the depths.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program aimed at stopping the chaos in the financial markets has not received a majority.
The supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the need for a <0x24>700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic party's negotiating leaders, has called for the support of MPs, even if the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t even happened yet,” he admitted.
The Dow Jones fell by more than 6% and 600 points, respectively.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the poll, and then fell again after a failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The program must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers are registering more and more reservations.
A good winter is promising for German tour operators.
According to one study, the traffic of road reservations for the following months increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ travel mood did not decline, according to the study.
Travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales for the winter season compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV reported.
These results are based on data from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account travel booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is particularly sought after, the DRV said.
Here, the number of reservations increased by about one-third.
Germans are also particularly fond of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
Organized roads are most sought after, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the cost of organised trips is "better calculated for passengers than for individually organised trips."
Passengers can save money with advance booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laeple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so the turnover will increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists made a trip compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Recurring Ballermann hits, a liter of beers and designer dirndlit celebrities.
Debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really look much like each other.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she's wearing tailor-made dirndlis.
My hair's dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the grocery store.
But one thing unites us: we’ve only been at Wiesne for three minutes, and the photographers are already rushing at us and filling up their memory cards - it’s very flattering, and all this on my first visit to Wiesne.
That's how we make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli serves its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist from the north of the white sausage equator, my feeling of comfort is still limited by the folk costume.
But when we get to Theresienwiese, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndls or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand, all I get is my dirndli apron.
A Munich woman reminds me that I tied the apron wrong: "You are free tied to the left, virgin in the middle, sold to the right, widowed in the back."
I secretly knit the ribbon from the back to the left.
"That's good," he says, laughing.
Others make less fuss around subtle flirting techniques and wear a simple felt pattern with the inscription "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and unsolicitedly show their naked asses.
The young man with exhibitionist features is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, prolonging the "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
He tells me all this after he gets rid of the contents of his previously drunken jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone sees as trash cans.
So Bob is one of the notorious "forbidden urinators."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, ambulances roam the scene with their troops to take care of the poor pests.
The nurses always show up in a team - four people carrying a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure stuffed.
Who lies in the alcohol coffin under the tarpaulin is not visible.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics cries out to me at my question, and then in the turmoil.
Police named the victim of the accident
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in a hospital.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were burning with the desire to penetrate deeply into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building encompasses the ends of the platforms, with one tower at each of the front corners, and looks like a German town hall in the countryside.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little bumpy.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large-scale enterprise this had been the most western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of the conquests, wanted to realize its ambitions of conquering the Middle East with the help of this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station didn't get any better.
In 1917, a ammunition train exploded and destroyed the beautifully crafted roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and history has gone far beyond it.
At the same time, today, as a gateway to the railways to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, it serves - at least in a symbolic sense - as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Justice and Development Party in government -- the AKP -- has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is characterized by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish parliamentarian Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of turmoil, which also gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is destined for the symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specially designed for this purpose - located in a developing suburban area, between half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses. In the latter, middle-managers in suits - both men and women - meet to start a business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have belonged to a right-middle-minded politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy goal is to help Turkey re-integrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
It had to open in both directions.
"Is it possible that sooner or later you will be forced to vote?" he asked.
"Turkey never wanted to face a choice."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey itself.
It is as if they were trying to convey the message that together with Turkey, in a figurative sense, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those east-bound railway lines.
When I was again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who had witnessed the construction of this ornamental structure 100 years ago.
How they would be surprised to learn that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the harbor for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that at the time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least, there was no question as to which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memorable Life Paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, Sept. 11) has been Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir as Guildford Music Director.
The following year, on the basis of his musical plans for the district, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 should have been part of the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was consistent with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music that was put in front of it - whether it was a madrigal or a piece of Messiaen; without an accompaniment, or with an orchestral accompaniment.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and we owe it to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, "Let the music play itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the sheet music.
So sing it!"
His conducting technique was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever the level of music he was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there ever was a choir leader who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
In the past forty or so years, I have written reviews of more than 100 concerts, but I have never been disappointed by one, and I have often been thrilled by them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "walked around the world with one or two well-known battle horses."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25), "He continued his economic history studies at Oxford in 1946 and was awarded a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while he was constantly preparing for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, and a doctorate."
This comes from the authors' notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he actually resided in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is unclear why Woodruff embellished this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Wisdom
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black-and-white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and power that emanated from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photographs, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotions.
Resino is good at capturing magical moments."
Second sales record for Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
It is true that even its predecessor had a large enough cabin, but the interior design of the new model is even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, it has undergone a number of internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we go into the details of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in less time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but it has record sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car brand in 2002 and 2008 as well.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 it is estimated to sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazzs in the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2,000 copies sold in the course of a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate Honda’s decline in sales in Spain.
The company forecasts 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, which is a 16% decrease.
Despite sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, rising from 1.6% last year to 1.8%.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact-sized hybrid (4,370 mm in length) of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market share would be made up of the United States, while the remaining share would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight will take place in the first months of the year following the official launch in Valencia, which is scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every respect.
Its length reaches 3,900 mm (five inches longer), its width is 1,690 mm (two inches wider) and its axle spacing is increased by five inches, i.e. 2,500 mm.
Its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the cabin also became more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new bodywork on the one hand, and the fuel tank in the middle on the other - a solution we know from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total load compartment of the so-called double-floor trunk has increased, currently it is 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the fact that the dimensions refer to the model with the 1.4 engine, as the boot of the 1.2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some exterior modifications can also be explored, such as rear led lights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seat doors was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The second-generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its sale, this small model is available with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gearboxes.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both engines is lower than in the previous model, with lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical co-ordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which had 78 hp in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 hp in the previous generation, now reaches 100 hp.
The 100-hp 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoiding "bee car"
For the development of accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has this time drawn inspiration from nature, specifically from the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot to avoid accidents by imitating the bee’s flight.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C could be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technology Center, in cooperation with the renowned University of Tokyo’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Chief Technology Officer for Public Relations and Research and Development, defines the BR23C as a further extension of Nissan’s four-level safety cover.
The robot enhances the collision avoidance capability of the company’s products.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
More important, however, is the complex eye of the uterus, with which it can see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, so that the uterus can fly uninterrupted in its own personal space.
To replicate the function of the composite eye, engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
With a field of vision of 180 degrees ahead of the BR23C, the instrument identifies obstacles, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is instantly transformed into a collision avoidance operation.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction by simulating the movements of the uterus by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
What distinguishes the system from the instruments currently available is that in this case the avoidance maneuver is fully automatic.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the bypassing maneuver cannot be directed upwards or downwards or diagonally, but can only move in two dimensions and exclusively in the direction of the turning of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and way, as in the case of bees.
That’s why Nissan used a rotational function in the robot, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it’s really not gigabytes, and we’re not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an instant collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates will be available for mass-produced cars within 10 years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an additional application in order to get the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to invest, lacks common sense.
Because of the crisis, and so that Americans don't get caught up in the mazes of questionable mortgage banks, they created an entertaining and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel."
This is the "Bad Loan Hotel"... which is for the Galicians.
The grievous face of the accommodation, and especially the receptionist, suggests that we should think again, twice, or rather three times, whether the time for borrowing has really just come.
And most importantly, where to apply for a loan, as this is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on this website is useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
But what would happen if we complemented the game?
For example, in the hotel would appear the room of our dreams.
It’s a good idea, because we don’t even dream about buying a home.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a share capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay <0x24>9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after the Morgan Stanley stock price fell sharply on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of <0x24>25.25, or a total of <0x24>3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional <0x24>6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion rate of <0x24>31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is executed at an average exchange rate of <0x24>29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock price fell by 6.79% at midnight Greenwich, closing at <0x24>23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which will allow it to diversify its activities, while also taking control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG confirms once again that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the Wall Street-listed corporate giants.
On Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would consist entirely of ordinary shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s Managing Director in Tokyo.
However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and eliminate potential risks.”
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share is reduced by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year if the latter’s trading price exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. increases to approximately <0x24>47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from the MUFG can help you take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
The group’s spokesman, however, did not want to give accurate information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After joining MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency ratio by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said his balance sheet had "significantly improved" since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great trial for the group, as the price of its shares has plummeted by half, while the cost of its insurance against default risk has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
Of the large investment banks, only one "survivor" remains after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had received <0x24>15 billion: part of this comes from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group of companies.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
The rebuilding of the republic in the spirit of 21st-century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his co-presidents and friends, Correa explained his views on the new constitution on Sunday.
He succeeded in his mission, with 64% of voters voting in favour of the referendum, according to the official results, which included 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted 'no', 7% of the votes were void, and 0.7% of the votes were unfilled.
The draft Constitution needed 50% + 1 vote to be passed.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling stations’ exits and counting by an NGO proved the huge prevalence of the 'yes' votes with a 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa spoke about his victory over his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has been an overwhelming victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report from the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main topic was a 444-point text summarizing the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, retaining the right of the state to “plan development” for a country that basically lives on oil extraction by foreign companies and currency sent by emigrants.
The 2006 draft Constitution of Correa also strengthens the powers of the head of state, who can obtain mandates for no more than two consecutive terms and have the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again for the presidency in February 2009.
The president has already begun to introduce free healthcare and education in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the minimum subsistence.
Finally, the Constitution bans the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as the basis for U.S. anti-drug measures.
19 hostages freed in Chad
Egyptian forces have taken 11 tourists and their eight companions hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad this morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport, at about 3:30 p.m.
The hostages were banned from speaking to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a suburban residential area of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy” and the kidnappers “have not paid a ransom,” Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in an off-road safari, and the group was then transported from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostages.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organized the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived in two helicopters at the scene of a raid on the hostages just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," the leader said, asking for his name to be kept secret.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces from Egypt's Lightning Brigade were sent to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action teams.
“We have to acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and action teams,” he said, without further details.
He also denied that a ransom was paid for the hostages.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that they had intercepted an SUV carrying the kidnappers, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two of them.
The military said the kidnappers were linked to a rebel organisation in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied.
Lettres - The "Silent Majority" of Culture
Newspapers and the ongoing election campaign are currently focusing on the debate on the financing of culture.
We should be happy about that.
But a slice of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who will raise their voices to highlight the ridiculous sums of money spent on small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical sites on the brink of starvation?
What politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about its monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American Neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in concert by all citizens, by all elected representatives, and by all government agencies.
Within the framework of the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 associations dealing with history, cultural heritage, archival and genealogy are engaged in researching history and preserving a large number of private archives and archaeological finds with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with their teeth and nails and protest with the last force of the drowning as property developers and decision-makers point their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, the first European to be in trouble due to the spill-over effects of the US credit crisis: the three countries provide a total of 11.2 billion euros to the financial and insurance institution with interests in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments agreed on the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition officer.
Fortis bank in the euro area is the first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been spilling over for more than a year, and the decisions taken on the bank can therefore be considered to be, in some respects, precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, nearly half (49 percent) of all three states will acquire the bank’s assets.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, the activities acquired last year from ABN Amro in the Netherlands, mainly insurance.
Fortis shares began to fall steeply last week, with severe crisis phenomena at the Institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s papers plummeted by about 12 percent to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the total market capitalization of the group is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but according to the company managers, this is unrealistic.
The company blamed the overseas market uncertainties associated with the adoption of the <0x24>700 billion US package plan for the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers went up a bit.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but so far no one has submitted a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not need to worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients so far, and the accounts have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with an applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that always requires the consent of the person concerned to use the prescribing data.
This must be in independent hands, or else we will leave the henhouse to the fox," said Richard Dick, the developer of the drug tracking program.
Insurance companies make the premium and the amount of the damages dependent on the health condition of the client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not take out insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only after the result of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: he can easily obtain from pharmacies the medications he has bought in the last year and a half based on the customer’s ID number, and from this the program itself draws conclusions about the disease he has and his health condition.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it suggests that you have virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
Several versions of the program are in circulation, some of them also specify a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do outside the paperwork, although small difficulties may arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, not the former.
Separate companies have been set up to retrieve and process the data, and before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they ask for the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been penalized for their previous omissions.
Recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory tests and combining them with data on drug consumption, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies are gaining access to the data, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate health data protection law, but its scope only covers health care providers and insurers.
A bill is in front of Congress that gives the authorities control over companies specializing in data provision.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough: he has therefore further developed his programme, which would make the transfer of data subjects subject to their explicit consent.
Another issue is that the person concerned can hardly refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox's benevolence.
The Global Marseille Menu
EU and India double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this issue has dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside other, largely global, issues.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit, which will focus on nuclear cooperation.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater say in international affairs, the member states have not yet managed to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the European Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double the volume of trade in five years, bringing it to just over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, meaning that air traffic can also rise in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the talks.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth EU partner.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although they both have had a large share of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed on a global deal at the climate conference next year to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is headed to the French capital today, where he is preparing to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, French companies are expected to be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
According to the news agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers have a strong presence at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will attend the 60th Buchmesse, the most important international copyright meeting.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair will be attended by 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with an area of 171,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square metres by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where information on the situation, trends and prospects of the Italian publishing industry will be presented.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is steadily declining, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane has been found
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane have been found missing on September 3, 2007 over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, dismissed any remaining doubts: "After locating the plane, we sent a team and now we can be sure that it was the plane Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," he said.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said that a commission of inquiry had been asked a few hours after the wreckage was discovered to identify the plane and establish that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two Fosset IDs issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set up a number of summits through which he entered into history.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he flew around the world in a balloon for the first time: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he drove around the land without landing.
His many records include flying over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original and definitely shaped hobbit with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest Mercedes-Benz "compact SUV", with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the introductory campaign of the SUV GLK, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the launch of the new vehicle uses a media communication tool that has not yet been used, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster action, consisting of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the surround presentation of the car, in which the new SUV, distributed around the Corso Como, will be visible in almost real-world dimensions and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer of the picture will feel as if the car is emerging from the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one to form a unified image.
With this promotion, Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotyped advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will it be able to attract the interest of prospective customers? We will see.
We will show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Trivenetian kids, they'll probably be banned from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, from whom all of Italy is now ashamed? Members of a group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They have never fought against the opponents.
The core of the group is on the right.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small scattered groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags showing the hometown of the fans were hovered: on Saturday, they were removed so that they could not be identified.
They are following the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleader team, the Levski fans.
The Italian football federation has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These tickets were by name, making it easier to check the fan team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: among those who were going to Sofia, there was no one who would be prosecuted, no one who would be banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related records were denied tickets and leave.
At the moment, the Ministry of the Interior is waiting for the minutes from the Sofia police, and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots can be punished with a five-year ban.
It is an international ban on visiting not only Italian stadiums, but all stadiums in Europe.
Our football hooligans are not allowed to enter any football field.
Fortunately.
But we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that these fewer than one hundred and fifty will be joined by others.
“This fire must be stopped immediately, and we must not excuse anyone who behaves in this way,” the Ministry of the Interior said.
So it’s better to keep your eyes open, especially since Wednesday’s national team day is approaching in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultrasonics.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Safety of Sports Events Committee, which can also count on a section of the Homeland Security Service, will meet with the intelligence services dealing with fan behavior.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arms under the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime..."
This idea was expressed rather unfortunately by Domenico Mazzilli, who had been appointed a few weeks ago as head of the surveillance service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli previously served as Chief of Police in Trieste, a city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, it is not forbidden to live the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was still shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let us also talk a little bit about the sound of the Italian anthem: it is not a crime, but, if I may say so, it cannot be called a good upbringing."
