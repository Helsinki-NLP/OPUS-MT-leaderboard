European inflation slips on food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent after the 2.6 percent in October, the EU’s Luxembourg Statistical Office reported.
The official forecast was only 3%, according to Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, arguing that the reduction would lead to an inflationary spiral along with rising commodity prices and declining unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in the twenty-two: it needs to “talk” the inflation so that it doesn’t have to take action later on on this issue.
In Germany, inflation in November stood at 3.3 percent, a twelve-year record, while in Spain it rose to 4.1 percent from 3.6 percent.
Eurozone inflation has been driven by rising food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached their highest levels since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to pay significantly more in 2007.
World oil prices have risen 52 percent this year, and last month they cost nearly <0x24>100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% this year to 2.5% in 2008, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation will remain at around 3% for the next three to four months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz’s support grew significantly by the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has never seen such a low 13 percent socialist support.
In the case of the Commissioner’s party voters, the difference – due to the greater determination of the opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to one-fifth (20 percent) support for MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is two per cent.
The number of voters in both camps is 1% higher.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate to its previous low - never before has it been so high, with 41 percent of those who specifically judged the country’s economic situation to be very bad, while another 46 percent said it was rather bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the changes in their financial situation after the more hopeful prospects of spring and summer.
For the next year, the larger half of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than all previous Gallup surveys, 71% of those surveyed felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job more badly than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 per cent of the respondents trust or have high confidence, while in Viktor Orbán, 38 per cent are supporters.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54%, while the president of Fidesz is trusted by 27%.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 per cent said they wanted the government and the prime minister to remain, at present this figure is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) only sees the solution in the call for new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of those surveyed respond to a question about their willingness to participate that they would definitely go, and another 20 percent say they would probably go.
By comparison, only 55 percent of the candidates would participate in a “sunday parliamentary election” and another 15 percent would consider their participation likely. The outcome of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the current intentions.
74 percent would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to visitation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital allowances.
If we look at the same percentages only among those promising their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visitation fees and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco raised by nearly a fifth
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets maintained last year’s average price increase of 16 percent, except that VAT did not increase this year.
The Daily Economy article
On average, the Christmas basket of the Daily in the trade triangle of Budaörs increased by 16 percent again this year, but in each hypermarket there was a growth of well over a thousand forints in value.
Since prices in grocery stores had already "swept" in December last year, there was no drastic increase in the percentage compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to get under nine thousand forints last year is not available for ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets examined.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(The price of the basket was HUF 6,800 in 2003.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as last year, but turkey breast fillet, nuts and poppy seeds were also very expensive.
The price of flour and bread in the shops was followed by the data of the KSH, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 HUF.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter returnable bottled Coca-Cola was below HUF 200, so even with a deposit fee, they asked for only HUF 257 for the product.
This year, the Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily Basket, while the Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased the prices in its Daily Basket by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in their Daily Basket by 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive growth was 21 percent.
The average increase in HUF was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase was 1206 forints, so that the rise in VAT in prices felt its effect last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, apparently the stores were unable to decide how much margin they would apply to a product, as they were unable to calculate the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader designs the rotational speed of a product incorrectly, he may lose a significant profit on the margin adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily Basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive one was 1720 forints more than in 2006, while the cheapest one was only 844 forints.
This year this extreme did not show itself, as the most expensive one was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1284 forints more expensive.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increased catastrophically by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(By the way, this does not necessarily justify the HCSO’s data: the statistical office’s price increase of more than 30 percent for some basic foods over a 12-month period.
For example, besides the egg.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost absurd for the latter, as the price level of the already quite expensive product last year produced a price increase of just over 10 percent compared to the base, even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg-sized ones, and they also managed to fool the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
According to our experience, in the three stores visited, most of the customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the permanent food as a plateau.
On Wednesday morning, there were serious queues in front of the cash registers in all three stores because of the sudden increase in the number of visitors.
However, we know that there is less traffic in the countryside, and many of them complain to research companies that even their plans for income are lagging behind, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places they save on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overcrowding of the staff do not favour the cessation of infections, according to the head of department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
A man who was admitted after a serious accident was found to have a bacteria that was resistant to antibiotics.
The patient is isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but had to return shortly afterwards with an MRSA infection, and an important surgery had not been performed since then due to bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Head of Department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been recorded in hospitals, the rest are unknown.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a bacteria that one-third of people carry in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. pharyngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, when antibiotics are used excessively or inadequately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop a highly resistant bacterium that spreads rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently dysfunctioning, patients with a weakened body, elderly or low body weight may develop serious hospital infections such as wound infection or sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistance to antibiotics
"We will isolate such patients, the nursing staff will take care of the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are tested for the presence of MRSA, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current hospital conditions and conditions in Hungary are not favourable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and old people’s homes, hospitals should monitor patients entering and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests.
Most cases will come to light if the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, the head of the epidemiological centre said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections and pathologies.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of drug resistance, but this is not always observed in hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
They save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the rooms are often crowded and the beds are often very close to each other, although epidemiologically, patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina Böröcz noted that in hospitals with unfavourable financial conditions, disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses and many patients, so the chances of infection are even higher.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, fewer such infections can be detected or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA causes huge expenses for health insurers, which is why they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, it included the prevention and reduction of MRSA in the government programme.
The programme appears to be successful, and the data reported show a decreasing trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) prioritises the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The police officer who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the 21st district police chief has been prepared.
It is not possible that the police captain of District XXII, who had resigned from his post in drunken or intoxicated state, who hit a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office on Friday after the expert opinion on the matter was prepared.
The expert’s opinion supported the primary finding, which already concluded that the former police chief had not consumed alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII. district police station hit a 55-year-old man on a turn on the Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII. district on Tuesday with his own car, who did not want to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not otherwise a mitigating circumstance according to the rules of the KRSZ, the turning car driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Due to the incident, the district police chief resigned and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because he was so shocked by the incident.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police chief cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the very beginning.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Three <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million credit line agreements to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy were signed on Friday by János Veres, Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), in Budapest.
The European Development Bank (EDB) approved in 2006 a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for financing the Hungarian budget of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million has already been signed by the parties, and the agreement now signed concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement will also be used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, with the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million to be used later, by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract worth EUR 50 million, which will be used primarily by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, Metro 4 was also mentioned.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes the details of subway financing with the EU, they will return to the question of whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Veres János, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is granted by the EIB with a grace period of 8 years and without any commission on the availability of the loans.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the whole of Europe is focusing its attention on the previously little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and by whom are they still buying in the EU’s cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular property shopping destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with inexpensive ski apartments and beach houses.
The most fashionable areas of the mountains are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, and on the coast are Albena, the Golden Coast, the Sunshore, the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria’s analysts, the central part of the country will sooner or later attract investors as well – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more people will shop around the extremely cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces promising the highest return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive European golf destinations, making it a top destination in the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying large amounts, for example, in the Bansko area.
According to the analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and traditionally there are many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, Re/Max Bulgaria’s regional director.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000, or degraded old houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a big city, shops and generally close proximity to the local doctor.
The second category is for holiday shoppers (Bulgaria was added to the top 10 German holiday destinations list in December).
The third group is made up of business-oriented investors who buy in the hope of medium- to long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital continues to rise, as demand is increasing.
Although real estate prices in the European Union are the lowest in Bulgaria, they have increased by 21% a year in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is substantially greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentage
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the efforts to follow the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol to 2012.
This issue is currently under discussion between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has also indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another big issue of the conference is whether developed countries will undertake to reduce emissions and provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
There is also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The fund, which is provided for under the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board, which is expected to be part of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Six percent of Hungary
Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to preserve its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of concluding the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to undertake a reduction of up to 30% if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to undertake commitments corresponding to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol set a target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, including the EU-15 member states at the time - minus 8 per cent.
Hungary’s obligation is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will fulfil.
The stakes are high in Bali, as a long-term international agreement on climate policy must be reached within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be postponed to 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction scheme, which the latest report of the IPCC, the UN’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate, international scientific body on climate change, points out.
This would delay emissions reductions and make it inevitable that the average global temperature rises above 2 degrees Celsius, with extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
The British Army is Recruiting on YouTube
Videos of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are being posted on the video-sharing site by British military units promoting themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to get on YouTube: special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature cameras are checked at the Air Force's Operations Command in Kandahar and sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable.
The air force has already uploaded 139 images to the internet, and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and is publishing videos of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Corps (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The original purpose of the Air Force was to post the videos for recruitment purposes, and the Defense Ministry said it was also a good way to make the public aware of the real purpose of the military’s presence abroad.
“Propaganda in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertising,” Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert, told the BBC, “but it inevitably carries a political message, as it justifies the military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game.
In addition to carefully edited, censored footage, the military also has a problem with the addition of amateur videos that show the deaths of soldiers, for example: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about the losses but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
Several videos from the Iraqi and Afghan military scenes have already been released on the Internet, but the British Army has only recently received them.
The Americans recruit a little bit differently, with a free-to-download shooter called America's Army, in which the player can take on the role of a soldier in a more or less realistic simulation.
There will be a Christmas and a Christmas party at the ministries.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who can say goodbye with cakes and coffee from 2007.
There is a ministry where there will be a live music party, and elsewhere they will bring a Christmas spirit to the hearts of the officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so have fun with power.
Public offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry’s largest Christmas party will be held this year by the Ministry of Defence, but HM is not waiting for ministerial employees.
The children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts at the Christmas of the Orphans, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited at the Christmas of the Mission, but also a press reception is held.
The budget is <0x24>25 million for the year-end mood.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are kicking me out of the harness compared to the other ministries.
The GKM’s party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total of HUF 4,320,000, and about three hundred and fifty of the six hundred ministerial employees are expected to attend.
At the wallet ceremony, they will stick to the Christmas mood, but there will be performers and lotteries.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints, and it was held in the building of the National Council of the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - there were also concerts and dinners.
The room rent cost a million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, one of the departments of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration: this is organised with EU money by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre.
The building of the Vígszínház was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt., as we were unable to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which instead of Christmas held a Luca Day ball on December 7.
He did not ask them for money to use the halls of the OIT.
500 people attended the ball.
The party started with the Minister’s toast, and after dinner you could dance to live music.
It was said to the question of [origo] that evening dresses and suits were not compulsory at all at the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Local Government will organize a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a show and a celebration for the employees in its own building for HUF 400,000.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially expects her colleagues to attend a workshop at the end of the year instead of a Christmas party.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected, who, the press department said, will receive only coffee and scones, so the party will be brought out of HUF 350,000.
Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own large hall, which is expected to accommodate 436 employees.
For each guest, HUF 2,500 is dedicated to the Christmas party – the sum includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since János Veres is the Minister, the employees of the PM have celebrated Christmas in the same way every year.
There will be no bulihangulat, however, and the official status will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year’s reception on 20 January, the Ministry’s Christmas is cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City Park, and according to the announcement of the wallet, 1000 HUF per one hundred guests will be allocated.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are invited to do.
These annual receptions start with a brief ministerial toast and end with a restrained snack.
There will be no Christmas party at all for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture, the press departments said.
The Environmental Ministry’s official Christmas price could not be announced in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering.
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Councils will form their strike committee on Monday to coordinate the strike for an indefinite period.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and on Monday – the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act – the cessation of work will begin.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop, and there will be a strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, he will present the details of the Monday’s strike organised by the League Trade Unions together with the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely from Monday if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date has been set - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - for the end of the strike that has begun.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
If they vote in favour of the legislation, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to proceed.
On the basis of the Parliament’s agenda on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted on late in the evening, possibly at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions in transport can be expected: work at the railway will be suspended indefinitely, part of Budapest’s public transport, more than half of the Volán companies, may be suspended in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a semi-track road closure in many parts of the country.
Several trade unions and NGOs joined the strike call, and their list is constantly updated during the League’s month.
Some organizations have declared a strike for an indefinite period, while others have declared temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to the reports so far, from the start of operations there will be a strike at BKV, at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., a four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Electricity and Heat Energy Industry Trade Unions, and the Teachers’ Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers called for a two and two to eight-hour work cessation.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide at alternate times, and the Democratic Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) is on a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for a health insurance reform and put a new concept into public debate.
The second requirement is the gradual introduction of a new method of calculating pensions due next year.
The third is to ensure that the early retirement pension guarantees the possibility of entry into the system even before 2010 in the case of deserving jobs.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) belonging to the League of Trade Unions does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport regarding the railway wing lines, expecting a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the risk to the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
According to the company’s “risk warning”, the biggest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that “with the escalation of the ethnic tensions already existing between the gypsies and non-gypsies in Hungary, even violent ethnic clashes can develop in the short term”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
“The public discussion of the Roma issue has been handed over to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who have been able to build a political strategy on the gypsy-Hungarian conflict.”
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard under the influence of large domestic and international media attention “substantially undermined the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of belief in the stability and democratic development of the country”.
It is recalled that the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which have gained increasing publicity and momentum since the autumn of 2006, is part of the fact that since the summer of 2007 several organizations have been established in Hungary, calling themselves “national self-defense” associations.
“The common feature of these assemblies is that they define themselves as NGOs, while they openly proclaim the preparation of their members – whether armed or not – for defence (disaster protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, in addition to the incompetence of the police, the army, that is, the state,” they added.
They noted that all this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the anti-political and anti-party nature of society, seeks to put various political aspirations into the civic garment.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association are therefore not only used to avoid the legal pitfalls of court registration in these associations, but also as a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries are seeking to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is driven by the mass Roma riots that have erupted in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this to decide on the formation of the guard, saying the organization's goal was "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced “gypsy terror”, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent.
They added that the initiative provoked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they are setting up their own guards to resist.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far has similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threat by organizing their own self-defense.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said to the Telegram Office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis annually, and if they experience anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
Not every day is red
In Hungary, the law accurately marks red-letter days, and the rearrangement of working days has become a common practice around the holidays, which will be less next year.
There is no common holiday in the United States and the European Union.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly associated with church holidays and important historical events.
Here we also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the New Year and the first day of the New Year are working holidays – the latter just so that the New Year’s Eve fans can rest.
There are 11 red letters throughout the year.
March 15 and October 23 commemorates the Revolution of 1848 and the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the founding of the state, on 1 May we celebrate the work, and on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our deceased relatives and friends.
We also celebrate Easter, Pentecost and Christmas for two days.
As our state, national, or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekends according to the calendar, shifting the working day has become a practice in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that on previous Saturdays we don’t stay away from work-school.
The exact time to work the day immediately before or after the holiday has been regulated for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate decree.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and civil servants.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating uninterruptedly and operating on public holidays due to their purpose.
This year, the working schedule will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life in the country almost stops, as experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve are being “slided down” by the majority of people, or they are using their spared holidays for this purpose.
Next year we will have more holidays in the middle and end of the week, so there will be fewer workday shifts than this year.
First, the calendar is changed around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day in exchange for Friday, May 2.
The second relocation relates to the holiday of 23 October: it will have to work on Saturday 18 October instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, can be completely in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from 24 December almost everywhere there is a nonstop break even if New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Fearful Things You Can Use to Annoy Your Colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost don’t notice: they “color” everyday at work.
The question is whether you will get used to the little inconveniences or wear the gloves and consciously avoid misunderstood situations that are annoying to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you about the call from the marketing department," one of your colleagues says.
That's why you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it right, perhaps calling the marketing department to tell you you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less conventional solution).
Usually it's done with an apology.
Before making an awkward apology, it’s worth thinking about what you can do to get your colleagues unpleasant moments, and consciously trying to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching out for a paper, office supplies, or your phone, and it's not there.
Do you remember yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but it was on in the morning?
Do you find your pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightly be angry at you for robbing their property.
Don’t pocket office envelopes or post-it because it can be uncomfortable if it runs out prematurely and you need it right away.
You gossip about your colleagues' privacy?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t put your personal information (presence) on everyone’s nose.
If one of them shares his most intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust.
Bury what you hear within yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know what your colleague has been doing.
You're reporting an unjustified patient?
When you call the office and you report a patient with a splitting headache because you feel uncomfortable or feel like you’d rather rest that day; remember that your work, your urgent tasks, your future work should be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won’t be going to the office the next day, or something might happen that makes you need to stay at home, signal that your colleagues and your boss don’t face your absence the next day.
Bumping, laughing, calling
You're getting into work, and you're being harshly pulled out of it by the laughter of your colleagues?
Did you unwittingly witness a phone conversation that you would have preferred not to hear?
Do not bother your colleagues with bulging, singing, loud conversation (which you have over their heads), or with throbbing feet, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they aren’t going into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If something is out of time, you forgot to send an important letter, message, and don’t blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos that may be in the office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit that you have made a mistake and that someone else has suffered from it, and eliminate the damage.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, make up for your omission.
Do you feel at home in the office?
Bear trousers and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable outfits if your job permits.
Don’t be slippery with your colleagues and honor yourself by going into the office in ordinary clothes – if your job requires it, nicely and elegantly!
If you want to meet, you are no longer interesting
Busting the car in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio comes a special melody: the sound of a violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm gonna push the volume up.
The music changes at a pace and the bass comes alongside the previous tones, then a female choir turns on as a real jewel.
Zagar's Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music life did not spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like the traffic's different if you're listening to the new Zagar disc.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and even though the guitar-dripping garage rock is in fashion again, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started out in Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderboi’s band, until – perhaps because two honks couldn’t fit in a csárda – he started his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, however, it began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Ferenc Török Season.
His initial formations in smaller clubs were known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked his first album in 2002 as one of the fifty most important Hungarian albums, and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, was proclaimed as the only Hungarian trendsetters who seemed to be marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they were happy to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the early Pécs years.
This was one of the old bands of Balázs Zságer.
With the airy, aviation reference, we would be there, but besides the airiness of the music, the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll, has just appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the era.
In these songs, the premiere of the album in Millenáris was performed by the singer György Ligeti, who currently works with The Puzzle in England.
The album also produced a real radio hit, with mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who played popular music from morning to evening, smuggling into the ears the grand melodies of Wings of Love recorded with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zsázer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: how much layer music are you playing?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layered music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of popular music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Alternative, underground music can also be flat, meaningless, and in the same way made for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from sincere motivation.
The attitude of the hosts also operates in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially west of us, the popular music has greater traditions.
Not only the ten-year-olds attend concerts there, but also the older ones.
Rather, they follow the changes in popular music around them, because they consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
HVG: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where and how many people listen to your music?
ZB: It feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more perceptible at concerts, where the effect on each other already works, but it is only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
HVG: How far do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works solo and has built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We’re not really on his way, despite the fact that sometimes they try to explain this into our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other person's musical presence and lets it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us left his orchestra and started on a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love ranked number one on the top list of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time.
Are you consciously opening up to a broader layer with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit and sell the album with it.
This song is more than that.
We intended it for the finale of the album, with which we tried to unlock the sound orgy and the harder topics that had been on the album.
HVG: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling this choir from the sounding soloists of our own Hungarian music scene.
This is how the six-member choir - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was formed, which we then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you design the song like this or did the girls make it like this?
Zs.B.: The song existed in an instrumental version for a long time, and then when the disc material came together, we thought we needed something more for this song.
The chord sequence attracted him to sing.
That night I sing the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost spontaneous and frightening at first.
I remember being very excited at the time, but of course I needed the ladies.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together and are not louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were also on the back stage.
Is that intentional?
ZB: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely due to technical problems.
It is clear, however, that we did not want to play solo roles.
The song is about forgetting our ego a little bit, who came from where, where we are going, just letting those wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
HVG: Which one did you work with most of the time?
Zs.B.: In the musical creative process, there were actually pieces that were more difficult than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play on a competition piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then slowly everything took its place, like in a puzzle game.
HVG: What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is changing all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "released" the album.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions because of the feeling of inferiority
Unfaithful embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Société Générale, calls his ex-employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was not at all a talented player, but rather a big player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally impaired," his superiors told the police.
However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, Kerviel’s testimony reveals that at the end of last year he made a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis not just in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his confession.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity was felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income or past repayment problems customers.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe that, and he put me on a good horse.
At the end of the year, its profit reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"When I earned the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," admits Kerviel, adding that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he forged his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to fool his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his trades.
Risk was profit
Were you afraid it would all come out?
I'd rather not.
“I thought the fact that I made <0x24>1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them.”
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked for the Société Générale Bank in 2000.
His annual salary was around <0x24>51,000.
Two years later, he became a brokerage assistant and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of <0x24>90,000 per year.
He knew that he would never earn as much as others.
“I knew in my first conversation in 2005 that they were looking at me the wrong way.
“It’s because of my education and my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told the investigators.
Shortly after his entry, the first great success came.
Allianz’s shares earned him money as he pledged half a billion euros to lose those shares during the London bombings.
And this triggered an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses supposedly knew everything, or rather suspected everything.
"While I was earning money, they closed their eyes."
There was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
He wanted to cover it up one weekend in mid-January.
When he went to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
"Last year I only took four days off.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to be able to take a look at his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic to raise <0x24>365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic could receive 14 billion euro (approximately 365 billion kroons) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic will be able to obtain approximately half of the total amount from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion kroons will be spent on the regions.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion kroons from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, goes to transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and accounts for 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund for the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed with 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to acquire tools for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in obtaining funds from the EU funds so far.
Former Nicaraguan President Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the former president of the country, who was sentenced to <0x24>100 million (almost 1.8 billion) in 2003 for financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will be put back behind bars is unclear, according to AP news agency.
According to Ileana Perez, the president of the Court of Appeals, it will be up to the prison’s administration to decide whether to leave Aleman’s sentence at home or return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that Alemán regularly transferred government money to foreign companies’ accounts in Panama.
These fictitious corporations and their account numbers were in reality those of their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were subsequently spent on a foundation set up by Alemán to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This went through this year with the support of the Social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford to vote no.
Unlike the debate over distrust of the government before the vote, there was no drama this time around.
The House passed this generally ignored, albeit most influential, law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with each heading and item in the budget, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggles between the government and the opposition.
This is more thankful in the press, which is why it receives much more attention in the media.
Politicians’ debates are far more interesting to the public than just numbers.
The state budgets of previous Social Democratic governments had three shortcomings that the 2008 budget could not solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high rate of mandatory, so-called principal spending law, which includes not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections.
The second is the deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are budget deficits in cities and districts.
Many mayors have been able to raise money for investments other than taxes, levies, and bank loans, often issuing bonds with which their town halls are disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
They no longer have such resources.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a phase of growth, which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the country became increasingly indebted.
The other countries, with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were far more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is a huge disgrace to former governments.
We are among the countries least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for huge social programmes, for example, which have unfortunately become gigantic in recent years.
Although this year we have succeeded in eliminating some of the senseless populist spending approved before the elections, even if there is no pushing the retirement barrier and pension reform in the near future, then in this country any policy will actually end, and whoever governs it will be just bureaucracy.
With a bit of exaggeration, it can be said that most of the money taxed by the governing politicians usually turns into pensions and social benefits into mechanical distributions.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by the expenses of the principals.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if former governments had not squandered everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not want the government to become mere officials, we must be patient and wish peace of mind in the preparation of further reform laws for this coalition government, which is not too strong and knows that the state can only give out what it can get from taxes and levies.
This is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Krej<0xC4><0x8D>í
Banks want to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to join forces to fight the financial market crisis.
The financial markets will cost more than <0x24>100 billion through the stock exchanges.
These exchanges raise interest rates on the bank, for which they are ready to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will put <0x24>40 billion into the stock exchange and make another <0x24>24 billion available to the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, central banks have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl, an economic Outlook Group consultancy, in a report to his clients.
"The coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks in the United States have already lost <0x24>60 billion in loans that have not been repaid.
Analysts are expecting billions in losses.
“Central banks can indeed be afraid of what might happen if they decide to do so,” said Kieran Davies, ABN Amro’s chief economist.
It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves find it difficult to access loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce the need and plunge the American economy into recession with possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR), which is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of reciprocal lending, despite the fact that the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain also cut interest rates a few times during the fall.
"This will have a similar impact to further interest rate reductions," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ move will contribute to resolving the crisis, as it will not solve the underlying problem of the collapse of the US real estate market.
The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change threatens developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the UN International Conference on Climate Change held in Bali.
The book Blue, not the green planet, presented in Vienna, made it clear that the debates of ecologists are unbelievable.
Klaus said that not only is the conference's structure unacceptable, which is made up of a peculiar mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
“The debate there is absolutely lacking in structure, it’s just throwing words that are a substitute for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
In presenting the book of the Czech President, he stressed that the topic is very important for him and that is why he is so committed to this topic.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would also be published in German, as he said, "I often only see caricatures of my opinion."
Now, therefore, the interested ones can read the not-distorted opinion.
Klaus recalled that, although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has sufficient grounds to write such a book.
As a professional scholar who can monitor and evaluate professional dissertations, he is experienced in statistics and an economist.
As a conclusion to the book, he stated that the climate is constantly changing, that its changes are normal, and that all scientists do not agree on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so they do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of liberty.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
A similar topic was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people were unable to exchange their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their old driving licence in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day they can apply for an exchange so that the authorities will be able to issue the new driving licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, 100,000 drivers will leave without valid authorisation.
According to the authorities, the driver’s license has not been replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the walks represent a sharp drop in interest in driving licence exchanges, the capital’s offices have been flooded with applications for driving licence exchanges, for which interest has increased this week.
The mayor’s office receives about 2,000 clients every day.
You have to wait in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licences.
A new driver's license will be issued for 20 days.
However, the new driving licence may be applied for with a shortened time limit of five days.
In such cases, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 crowns.
Drivers who are unable to change their driving licences by the end of the year and leave with an invalid driver’s license will face penalties from January onwards.
The culprit must pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also settle the offence by agreement.
In the case of administrative violation, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
On the basis of previous information from the City Hall, even those who do not travel anywhere may be fined.
It can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be indulgent and to impose penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
However, Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said there were no threats from tens of thousands of fines.
A driver’s license is a document that allows people to decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that must be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive should give up their license.
It is enough to take it or, preferably, to send it by post to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually replace the other types of driving licences.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 can be replaced for a further three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents involved.
Court cuts penalties for Berdycchel-linked investigators
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, former police officers suspected of joining up with David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court with definitive effect, which thus reduced the sentences of one and the other by two years.
Investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were originally threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is awaiting a first-degree verdict.
In other cases, he was sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't get any more.
In January, the county court found 19 people guilty of robbery, of which 16 were appealed by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the allegations from the start of the investigation, claiming that it was a speculative matter.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members, following an agreement with Berdycchia, among other things, provided criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robbery attacks and helped the gang avoid prosecution.
So the gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The indictment is about the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
These are primarily robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to their health, but also abuses of public authority and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because police found illegally held pistols, steel-core bullets, laser sights, or machine guns during searches.
The gang was accused of robbing tens of millions of crowns.
The gang, which had less than 20 members, had already been convicted by the courts of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych’s environment testify before the court even in other proceedings, some of which have not yet been brought before the court.
The first instance trial has so far avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Puta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Invoice for child exchange: 12 million
For the children traded at the maternity ward, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, demands 12 million kroons of pain fee plus court expenses from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Veleba, disagrees in principle with the proposal.
"We reject such a demand because it is too much," Dostal said after today's trial.
“In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll see if it has any usable value.
But we maintain our belief that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between K<0xC4><0x8D> 100,000 and K<0xC4><0x8D> 200,000 for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was the subject of an expert review prepared by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they encountered reproaches such that they did not prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women cope worse with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were exchanged by nurses at the obstetrics in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>ermákék in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district manager of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed over 100,000 crowns to the families to cover their expenses, which resulted from the failure of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ské, which is managed by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have compulsory damage insurance.
In case of error, they must reach the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they can ask for the help of the founder.
The courts have so far approved relatively low amounts of compensation for the people, calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million kroner.
Polívka lost the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Polívka lost his lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the judge of the Ostrava District Court, although he was the first to use the name King of Valach, the project was developed by a team around the actor Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with many years of work.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team parasitizing on Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
In the words of the Kingdom of Valachi, everyone thinks of the actor-comedian.
This view is shared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the dispute is money.
Years later, they realized that the project was a success and they could gain something from it.
They want to live off our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, the name "King of Valachi" was first used by Polívka in her television show.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing passports to Valachi.
The original student prank operation was transformed into a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the establishment of the society of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include her name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting her farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used the idea itself, which Polivka published in the Maness for the sake of her business.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project," the judge said.
However, he added that the heart of the project was the intensive Harabish and his team.
The co-operation between the now-disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabish organized an official coronation for the Pole in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabish, resulting in the acquittal of "the eternally elected King Boleslav I".
At the initiative of Harabish, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulaková took the lead in the kingdom as the mother queen.
In 2002, he filed a court action against Polivka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and her associates, which the court rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light to the debate for the throne and half for the queen.
This battle should become a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details or the time.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like a royal march in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polívka is also welcome to report," Harabish added.
Test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: Disappearing Prejudices
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the thread are nothing special, the quality of the switching, driving and production can often be described as below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, is significantly better.
And the combi called the SW goes a degree further, so I have no choice but to think more.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the place left for the head in the rear seat.
This time the complaining is over, because the body of the combi means that even the two-metre-high giants do not suffer in this regard.
Fast in the world
I get through the interior quickly, so I don’t repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively successful design, where my only excuse is the poor console.
A little more designer inventions would be appreciated here, since the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
The lateral drive was also significantly improved compared to the 206.
As for the space, here too, you can feel an increase in the size of the bodywork.
In the combi, afterwards, the few places of the head already mentioned disappear.
Luggage in the trunk
The most important part of this vehicle is its luggage.
This is very accessible (also thanks to the folding rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with tyres, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be disassembled and can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume a little bit.
Based on the tables, this is 428 l in the basic layout, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - against the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when placing a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I should highlight the positives, then I also have to mention the almost completely straight flooring after folding the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6-litre, 88-kW four-cylinder, foreign-ignition engine.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the 1,600 should look like, which drives the family hatchback.
Quiet, low-consumption and mainly pulling.
If you compare it with your <0xC5><0xA0>KODA counterpart, which often feels like a rag has been stuffed into your exhaust, I can only rejoice.
The price is whispering
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we should remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder foreign engine still goes for 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
The car starts at 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment adds an additional 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> to the equipment.
But we also had head airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic wiper start, rear windows electric remote control....
That is, the car with a case-trailer costs 531,900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That's a lot, but count the additional equipment of the Fabia, and you get a very similar result.
There is no choice but to choose the brand.
Failure to integrate Slovak students into British schools
There are more and more East European children in British schools, which raises concerns among locals about the further development of local schooling.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have already recorded cases where disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents have turned into violence.
The problems with the integration of children in Eastern Europe are illustrated by a case in northern Kent, where disputes are intensifying between their places and Slovak immigrants.
Disputes and quarrels between the pupils are already characterizing the relationships of the parents.
In Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The accused defends himself by saying that the boy insulted him with racist insults.
The police had to intervene after two 12-year-old girls were attacked by a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly slandered the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“On the way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he hit us with apples and pears and exposed his naked ass,” the mother of the Slovak students told The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the disputes about immigrants in Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The aforementioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is starting to become tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in Britain who are looking for jobs.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, this can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm like a fish pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters serving pizza, ice cream or liquor cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find this in a full and even richer list.
But there’s a lot more to see on an island, and it’s Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasury and a place of transhipment, which was plundered by the Spaniards in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and promoted for drugs, gambling, and prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tower houses were built, and cars, which became a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century, were circulating on the wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of the stars and politicians of American show business.
What about today?
You can also sign the wall of Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel serves you a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the '50s still circulate in Havana to this day, as the once-exported chicks and your sons have long since rotted in this salty and wet air.
Although primarily the oldest part of Havana has been significantly degraded, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there are.
Other places are becoming more and more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides so much needed money, its development has been given green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another unique gourmet in the world, which is especially appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to the sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so machines operating there can be seen, whose contemporaries can only be seen elsewhere in museums.
Where do we go?
The most famous places in Cuba are not avoided by most visitors.
So there is no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the Hemingway estate mentioned above has a museum, and those who love the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from lime.
Limestone formations, lime cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has accumulated in their caverns, thanks to which the decomposed cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found when visiting a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that it was where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy is embodied in the beauty and monumentality of a not-too-large city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Between the Escambray plain and the sea, Trinidad is so remote that even in the 1950s of the last century there were no roads that would have connected this area with the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped him stay an outsider.
Nothing was built there, so it was not demolished, everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it’s worth a visit to interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón or the Valley of the Sugar Factory.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music is quieted only in the morning.
Baracoa
The city in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the way itself.
Both roads from Guantánamo have to cross high and scattered mountains, passing through a nature hardly affected by human activity.
The eastern land bridge of Cuba has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its untouched nature.
Here the best chocolate is made, the church has the cross of Columbus (in reality it was made one hundred years after Columbus's navigation) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today the hotel El Castillo stands, you can see some of the sign mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Caridad del Cobra, the patron saint of Cuba, the Santeria, the African religion professed by the descendants of the former slaves, all have much to say.
That is, as they say correctly, it is better to see it once.
Afghan Allies Are Passive, Americans Say
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment also influence the course of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Minister Robert Gates said NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going according to the plans, the leaders of the countries that have units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also consulting on further plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States, with the assistance of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to become more active this week, the United Kingdom has prioritised strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to start developing the economy and security themselves," British Defense Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has been the strongest in the last five years, according to US government figures.
The number of violent acts increased by 27% compared to last year, and by 60% in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern Afghanistan.
However, the United States says the Allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
“We need to think seriously about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar spirit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and the equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been debates among the participating countries as to whether all allies are giving the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they have been deployed in areas with the least violence and combat requirements, so they are not as high against them as they are against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan slackers have been exposed: The Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a British team’s rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt will reach <0x24>1 trillion in 2009
Each Czech country has a debt of 84,000 kroons.
By the end of September, total debt had reached SEK 842.7 billion.
The government plans to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>159.2 billion this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry had reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroons due to the improved development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s public debt at the end of September reached SEK 842.7 billion.
Over the past nine months this year, it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
In June, however, it fell by 13.4 billion kroner.
Thus, the Ministry of Finance has today verified the government debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 kroons of debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion crowns.
“For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, the 1 trillion-kroon limit could only be exceeded in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion kroons,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora says: “We can cross the trillion mark in 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the political situation were to change, politicians would be willing to make more savings, and this could be postponed until 2010.
But I don't expect that change," he said.
Increasing debt
Government debt consists of central government debt, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Public debt is financed by treasury tickets, government bonds, direct loans or loans from the European Investment Bank, for example.
So far this year, the internal indebtedness of the state has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroons.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called marketable government debt had reached SEK 803.3 billion and decreased by SEK 13.7 billion as of June.
The average maturity of government debt has risen to 6.5 years.
“The debt between the full year has increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually quite a bit compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is increasing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when the pension reform is here,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
According to the financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007, the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroons due to the improved development of the state budget.
The sum is mainly made up of the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency's planned maximum resources of 13.3 billion kroons, a reserve of 10 billion kroons for the payment of pensions, the financing of 43 billion kroons of government bonds and the repayment of 1.8 billion kroons of loans from the European Investment Bank are concerned.
Teacher Appears Today in Court in Khartoum for Name Given to a Teddy Bear
A Khartoum court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in jail and expelled from the country on Thursday night for violating Islam in Sudan, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old pupils to name a teddy bear Muhammad, but the Islamic religion forbids any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished with a whip.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum was arrested on Sunday in her own apartment. She was accused of violating Islam and rebellion under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after the parents of the students filed complaints against her at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
"The children proposed eight names in total, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohammed," said the school's director, Robert Boulos.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children voted for the first name Mohammed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a diary together with the bear’s photo and the inscription “My name is Muhammad.”
The bear itself was not labeled with this name. The problem lies rather in the fact that any representation of the prophet is an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague who teaches at the same school, said that she knew him well and that she would never have done anything that would violate any religious beliefs. She said it was just a "innocent mistake": "I'm just sorry she had the children vote for the name."
Many students of the teacher agree with this opinion. According to them, the teacher "treats the children very well" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Remember that Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the Prophet. (This name is often given to the firstborn child of the family.)
What are the rules for using the first name?
Can this name be given to a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached on the future status of the province at Wednesday’s final court in Vienna.
The end result: failure.
Without any convergence of positions, the sixth and final meeting between Serbians and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties did not reach an agreement on the status," EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises of peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but it will be a very difficult time," he added, stressing "the existence of obvious tensions".
The mediation ends on December 10
The mediating troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-occupied province could be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harksenko submit a report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and final meeting of the talks since the UN commissioned the Troika to mediate again last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already frustrated Kosovo’s independence in the Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise," Bocan-Harcsenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years under the control of the United Nations, the Western powers believe that independence under the control of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina said it was ready to declare its independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in its favour.
Belgrade continues to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement," Kosovo's independent province president Fatmir Sejdiu said in a hotel in Baden, where "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s idea of autonomy would be “a continuation of a past of murders and deportations.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible and warned the Kosovo Albanian majority of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of a "domino effect" in a region still unstable by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right to veto.
“Kosovo’s parliament has the last word.”
“For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations have been going on for two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sheidiu told reporters that "the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word", adding that the Albanians' unilateral declaration of independence will be based on "consultation" with the Western powers.
Bush calls for agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, at the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to begin negotiations immediately to settle a 60-year-long dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush pledged to support them in every possible way in signing the “peace treaty” in 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must eliminate “terrorist networks” and Israel must cease its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the “roadmap for peace” adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the goal of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, led by Abbas, is “to sign a peace treaty that will resolve all pending issues, including central issues.”
The latter concern three delicate issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of today’s Israeli state.
Abbas, who spoke after the US president, insisted that future talks should be "global and in-depth" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
Olmert then pledged that future talks would be "indirect and continuous" and he would seek to "complete them in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush had set out to implement the “two-state vision” of Palestinians and Israelis.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington), with the support of all Arab countries, initiated a plan that would guarantee peace for Israel if in return it withdrew from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
“Annapolis is a choice in the history of the Middle East, especially because it seizes the problem at its root and focuses on central issues,” he said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this type of news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation by the National Police’s General Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 17:00.
"The car was patrolling, so it was not in action. It was driving at a speed of 40-50 km/h, without sirens," we learned from a police source.
The young man, without two helmets, was driven at "high speed" by a green engine "not registered in the official register and therefore not for use in road traffic" (see below) under the Kawasaki brand.
"Because the right-hand rule was not followed, the engine hit the left side of the police car," one police officer said.
The alcohol test on the passengers was negative.
The strength of the collision is clearly shown by the fact that the front of the car is wrinkled, the windshield is cracked in the form of a star, and the bumper is torn off.
Pontoise’s state prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced in an emergency statement yesterday morning that she had commissioned the IGPN and the Val-D’Oise County Public Security Directorate to investigate “the negligent murder and neglect of assistance.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, police responsibility can be ruled out.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses of the accident, who were questioned on Sunday evening, confirmed “the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, from a strip, undoubtedly pulled by footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles were colliding and traveling together for a while until the police car was able to brake them.
Vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened right after that?
In Villiers-le-Bel yesterday, rumors spread that police quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
IGPN is cautious about this, but excludes the possibility that the police have made "any serious mistake".
“This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased precaution,” a police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of your apartment looks right at the site.
"My cousin, who is a nurse in a hospital, went down immediately to try to resuscitate them," the witness said.
"We couldn't do anything anymore."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and lame.
The other two tried to resuscitate one young man, and the fourth one called."
The tension among those present increased as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the police officers who arrived were transporting their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
Heart massage was also performed, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help the young people.
The young people were helped.
The firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police blocked the first demonstrations following the state of emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
Witnesses in the eastern city of Lahore said about 2,000 lawyers protesting the state of emergency were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement.
They threw stones at police officers, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were hired.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
Several people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered attorneys at the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were several protests in Multan, in the central part of the country, and in Peshawar, in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers’ movement has been backed by the vast alliance of religious parties, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, who “urged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and rubbish to those who took an oath before Musharraf.”
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
The Court will have to declare in the coming days the legitimacy of President Musharraf’s re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
"Everything we're witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings," the president told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army to serve as a civilian president has “lost its validity” after the state of emergency has been imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musharraf had to leave the military uniform until November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has denied the country-wide rumours that Musharraf has been assigned a forced residence by his deputy general.
More than one-third of pregnancies are unplanned
This results in unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one-third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined), 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception.
This results in unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as pills and uterine spirals, still fail in 5 to 6 percent of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalization of contraception has made birth control more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took birth control pills in 1970, but now the percentage is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five is planning for a couple of months, and if possible for spring, as this is the most favorable time of year for receiving a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of a broken solar panel that is essential for the scientific work of the station.
This dangerous space walk proved to be a record in many respects: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to plan it, and it had to be done away from the residential modules with tools that were crafted by astronauts.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylindrical element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, we need to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew was to relocate one of the modules, which was already on the ISS, to its final location, producing electricity with the help of 17.5-ton solar panels.
The crew then began to open the module’s 76-meter-wide solar panels.
One of the harmonica-like foldable boards was then damaged by a cramped cable about 1 meter in length.
In order to avoid further injury, the board was not opened.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to take a walk from the Discovery space shuttle and then repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging from the space shuttle’s 30-meter robotic arm attached to the station’s crane.
He's one of NASA's best space walkers.
He is tall, strong, extremely skillful, has a muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old, doctor-educated man had to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage caused, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "rails".
He was also assisted by another "space walker" who stayed close to the safe passage, as well as other astronauts from the inside, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick that was insulated against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and crafted by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his companions to fully open the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today seven of them returned to the Discovery space shuttle to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
EADS Shares Decline
EADS shares in the Paris Stock Exchange plummeted after the aircraft and defense equipment manufacturer announced that the delay in the development of the A400M will result in additional costs of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion.
EADS shares are currently priced at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 after a 4% drop.
The company was forced to revise its 2007 operating profit forecasts due to delays in the development of the A400M engine, which is likely to delay delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the tactical transport aircraft, announced in October, "will cost between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion, of which more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion will affect Airbus," the parent company of European EADS said.
Due to these expenses, EADS will have to provide new design numbers for its operating result for 2007 on Thursday when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any further figures.
The Group also indicated that it had taken into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating profit decreased by 86%, largely due to the delay in the development of another program, the giant A380, which also put a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French military in October 2009.
The status quo remains
The elections on Sunday are not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s party, united Russia.
In this, the Russians’ demand for stability, a sort of arbitrary government, is manifested after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to the electorate via public service channels in a televised message, which has already been recorded, but its contents are still secret.
Putin leads the list of candidates for the Kremlin-supporting party, united Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the behaviour of the head of state did not reveal anything: it only made another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violations,” he said.
According to the opposition, this is far from the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe has put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zhuganov, said: “There were no such dirty elections in Russia even in Yeltsin’s time.”
After defeating the protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in jail for unauthorized protests and his lawyer claims he is still not allowed to visit.
“The Russians still think of us as ‘homo sovieticus’.
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who will follow Putin in the chair?
Yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election was announced in the official journal, which will be on 2 March 2008, and candidates will be able to indicate their intention to run until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be renewed.
There are no other descendants in sight.
What role will Putin play in March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful Unified Russia party or the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power wins both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has now become a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking in the way of 'homo sovieticus': they don't feel they can control their destiny," sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center, said in a statement.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people, all the more so because this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation, but by a certain economic prosperity,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "willfully reject personal responsibility", which quickly became apparent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
This phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current status quo: the local lists of the united Russia are led by 65 governors, who come from the leaders of 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West often represents chaos, as was the case in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: “Why should we think?
The ones in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?”
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archived documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelf space in Bad Arolsen in Hessen, have so far been searched for "humanitarian" purposes, providing only individual and name-based access to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archives to researchers and historians.
After all states have ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the archives in Bad Arolsen will allow historians to conduct research “on the relocation of prisoners, the residents of the camps and the health of forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of the documents as they contain names and thus confidential information.
This may include, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons, the purpose of which was to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly provide evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently working on the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archives of outstanding importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India sign free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath said in a statement.
Last April, EU foreign ministers approved the European Commission to open negotiations for the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India’s main foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth most important trading partner, according to the European Commission’s figures.
Peter Mandelson said: “A free trade agreement could be an economic stimulus for both sides, and India could thus increase its presence in a thriving market of 450 million people.”
The top ten products exported by India are Europe’s primary or secondary importers – added the European Commissioner. The two giants, Europe and Asia, meet each year in the framework of the exchange of “products worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion” and “services worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion” between the two Presidents of the European Commission, Mr. ManuelD.

Bank of England Offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion to Financial Markets for Five Weeks
The Bank of England has announced on Thursday that it will pump <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the money market, with a base rate of 5.75% and an unconventional five-week maturity.
"We want to alleviate concerns that the conditions in the money market will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions more securely for this period. Therefore, the Bank will offer a significant part of its reserves to the international financial market in a five-week open market operation from 6 December," the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be launched on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate and the repayment deadline is January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds under an open market operation for a period of five weeks.
The maturity of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it was “ready to take further measures” to ensure that interbank loans are aligned with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate was above the level of September 18, and is currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant penalty interest on money pumped into the money market, which has deterred banks from using it.
According to the rumour (which is only reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro), many would have preferred the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group on Thursday shut down the discussion of articles on the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text negotiated at the Socialist-initiated meeting contained about ten measures adopted by the National Bureau of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, such as a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the reintroduction of variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel cheques and restrictions on rents.
As the UMP and NC voted against examining the articles in a 180:115 vote, discussions between the ruling party and the opposition, which sometimes resulted in sharp talks, were finally interrupted, just a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised talk on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would re-submit all the proposals of his group in the framework of the amendment to the draft amending Finance Act, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Several rumors circulated about the new Philadelphia music festival to be hosted by C3 Presents, but now the company that organizes and promotes the event has announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with British producer Melvin Benn, Festival Republic.
“It’s an honor for us to be working with the person who started the American festival movement today,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival will be held in the summer, so there will also be a possibility to camp.
The festival will take place between August 8 and 10, on a 500-acre private property about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic Director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989, he began organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his palette with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3 employee Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival the "most inspiring event" he'd ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“We’ve already selected the venue in Philadelphia before, and we’ve worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organize this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"We had talks with the city and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organization failed," continued Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about it, and now we're going to host a huge festival at another unique venue that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Grant Park, Chicago in 2005, after demonstrating its exceptional festival-organizing talent with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was <0x24>9.8 million and <0x24>11.3 million, respectively.
Both festivals were held in the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on country festivals, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way to create both a European rural atmosphere and a sense of urban living as usual in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are eager to support the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favourable enough to make it possible to invest in an event of this size at a location that will hopefully host the festival for a long time.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be of a "giant" size, with a capacity equivalent to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, with a capacity of 80,000 people.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland is basically a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music to make sure everyone finds something they like,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles At, form the C3 company, which has been recognized as "Best Independent Event Organizer" at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when you have to fight the Terminator itself...
"Seduction" is one of the duties of the Montreal deputy.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Terminator Governor"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides which is the best location for it.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions, which will make them decide for us,” says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now focusing on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to showcase and promote as many Quebec films as possible at all U.S. film festivals, be they the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle and San Francisco Film Festivals.
The film L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des ténèbres was well received a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be released in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also featured four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts share their views on the "subprime" crisis
Less than five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their palms and looking forward to the usual year-end turn.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock market generally behaves positively in December.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily correct, and in the current situation the market is uncertain, at least in the short term."
Experts are far from advocating the stock market’s volatility at the end of the year, although they state that “the stock market is sustained by the presence of liquidity, which provides an opportunity to invest as there are no guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the flight to quality securities, both in the long and short term”.
As a result, they said, the stock exchange will be characterized by lateral movements that are not free from volatility, "especially because the impact of the Fed interest rate reduction is currently unknown, as the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are threatened."
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees, saying it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not at all rosy.”
Ibex's loss was nearly 4% from the highest values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15.945.7.
However, not all experts are so pessimistic.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana said the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganisation of wallets and contributions to the usual pension fund at that time.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility will influence market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to the technical level, and as a result we are experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on news from the U.S. about the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst hopes that they will be successful.
Analysts agree on what securities will be the target of reaching the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "this year it is the turn of the big securities".
The expert would add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, "because by then the electricity industry will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says the rise is due to the banking and industrial sectors.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, of course, if there will be any.
"ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that both Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will follow this path," the expert said.
Cyclical consumption will be a protagonist for the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although the Spanish market is not very represented in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two drops in the exchange rate in December.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock markets recovered from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a 6.68% jump was recorded in December.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (currently Ibex has seen an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally will take place.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens an account open for 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and will make a big change for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose branches are unusually open from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m., and even on Saturdays.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it plans to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he is currently preparing a deal with the trade unions to close 75% of his accounts in exchange for opening them one afternoon, though not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be of decisive importance to other institutions, as it will be the basis for deciding whether to join the initiative to support more favourable opening hours of shops.
This is the aim of the Banco Popular Español project.
They want to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses that shop at these locations.
The bank intends to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the above-mentioned opening hours, as this is not a new opening hours, but a modification of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in the commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, more colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, responsible for commercial banks, points out that restructuring does not require a large investment, but requires more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which even include negotiators for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience
The initiative has already been implemented by Banco Popular Español in three branches in Madrid.
According to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero, the experience has been positive.
The choice was made for the drawers in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid, and Rivero said it was the right choice.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 are under the name Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, and also have very favorable opening hours, opening even on Sundays and holidays.
The mentioned units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
"We did it."
With this sentence, Telecinco’s trusted advisor Paolo Vasile expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday, when it was revealed that his television broadcaster doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
However, one thing overshadowed his joy: "It only hurts that it is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less," he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, we "were spending less".
Telecinco closed at 2.54 percent.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66%.
Mediaset owns 52 percent of the company and Vocento owns 13 percent of the company, which is worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has seen a 40.5 percent drop since January, making it half the value of 2,193.46 million yesterday.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable, 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to similarities between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can deliver in the same market, at what cost, and how this will pay off in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to become the first TV channel with gross advertising revenues exceeding <0x24>1 billion this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the reported fact is realised, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the fiscal year 2006.
Antena 3's net sales increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (to 734.4 million), while television's net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that triggered Telecinco’s stock market momentum is the so far held high pay out: in 2006, the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of its return to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio could change after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol in partnership with Mediaset, his parent company.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payout of 50%, although we have always allocated a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already benefited from the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing a slight downturn.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the estimated increase in sales from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
According to the same company, Antena 3’s profits will fall by 4.5 percent in 2008 and by 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 reviews
1 .
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to its high profitability and long-term sustainable potential arising from dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: Sees Telecinco more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (retention) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strength.
3.
In both cases, JPMorgan recommends under-weighting due to "similar risks" (saturated market and unfavourable economic climate).
Congress approves adoption of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with a vote in Congress to approve the amendments to the Senate, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the regulations on which the law is based, so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of MEPs and Senators in negotiating and agreeing on the most favourable norms for investor protection, as well as the detailed regulation of the activities of companies, in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, enables the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new directive will allow for financial advisory services for specialised companies, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to create a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of executing transactions involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalization systems for executing orders, which compete with current stock market participants.
In addition, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information on the determining aspects of their business profile, their risk-taking and risk-management methods, and to keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Commission has introduced a number of amendments. Among them, it is of particular importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds due to their high risk to the investor. This has been proven in the context of the US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurial qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree on professional functions that could be performed exclusively by economists came into force in 1977.
The Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent working for someone else’s account, who does not need CNMV’s permission, and can distribute products or acquire clients for several investor companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account when calculating the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the development of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The calculation method used for the preliminary indicator is the same as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method is different to the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and may therefore deviate from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The consumer price index remains relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs, said that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary", but also predicted that the price index would be expected to remain "relatively high" in the coming months.
In Parliament’s corridors, Solbes confirmed that “although the indicator is not very favourable”, Spain’s inflation rate within the monetary union has remained more or less at the same level in recent years.
He also added that the month of November brought “less surprises” than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged in connection with the data released today.
With Northern Rock, Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over three years.
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently amount to only <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 billion) since it was in crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the Bank of England.
At the time, it still had a record number of deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which gradually declined over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the government’s pledge of a 100 percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate under its own financial and commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will need to raise about a quarter of the revenues of British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion, thereby reaching the <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion goal.
Richard Branson’s group, known for its remarkable advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium as the most favorable for avoiding bankruptcy. Besides Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana (People's Party) in Murcia this morning for being suspected of being involved in the urban corruption scandal that broke out this week.
In addition, a City Hall secretary and the town’s chief of police were arrested.
The former member of the city council, José Martínez Andreo, took the place of the EPP MP Juan Morales in May, who according to the official authorities interviewed by the SER radio channel could have been the head of the corruption network.
Police are investigating the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales’ lawyer has also been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to SER radio, Juan Morales’ lawyer was arrested while leaving Morales with corruption-related documents in his purse.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the position of President of Parliament if he wins the election.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Socialist Party Secretary General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE’s Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to assume the presidency of the parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE’s Secretary of Organization, José Blanci, and confirmed by Bono himself at the party’s federal headquarters after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today.
The Prime Minister explained his choice for the former minister by saying that “we have to count on the best in politics” and that Bono is “one of the best”.
In addition, he added that the Mancha politician "probably" will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidency of Parliament if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current parliamentary president Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 that he had no intention of running for the next elections and would instead give up his political career to fight against climate change in academia.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister was constantly besieging him to return to the political scene after he gave up active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters were aware of who would be the economic vice-president in the event of the Socialists’ victory, the party also wanted to inform them “in the spirit of transparency” about who would be the president of the Parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "a place of respect, not of insult or shouting" and more like the home of citizens.
“Occasionally, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to talk calmly, and the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.”
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his "excellent work", but did not want to present himself already as a president, so that his opponents would not consider him to be a "dominant".
Campaign for Climate
Since the movement for climate change is ruthlessly persecuting both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social struggles, it must be very strong.
In fact, Zapatero, the head of government, said that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and that “we have to make a new deal with our Earth”.
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain being at the forefront of the EU's non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
It should also clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits will the population have to change, what kind of energy savings should we expect at individual and social level and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not, and will not, have an explanation for these questions.
That’s because it’s about money and sacrifice.
Climate change has brought measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and costly for both companies and the general public.
Even the PSOE gas price increase would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we have to save the Earth from nothing, with nothing but propaganda texts, empty passwords without actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even beautifies election gatherings and awakens tenderness in us.

Mayor and police chief of Totana arrested for alleged corruption
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the city of Totana in Murcai province, the EPP José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, City Hall secretary and a catering entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources have informed today.
The mayor was arrested at his home, then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating at the City Development Council and the municipal authority responsible for managing the Industrial Settlements and Housings.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia by the arrest of six people in connection with the conversion of two hectares of agricultural land into built-up areas in order to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying commissions to managers during their previous mandate.
Two others have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the Totana Court of First Instance.
The first six arrested were handed over to the court.
Former Totana mayor Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP of the People’s Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial headquarters of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and contractor, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), together with Pablo José M.G., director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, which also belongs to the Nuaria Group and through whom the bribes were carried out.
The investigation is carried out by a group of members of the Gendarmerie's Operational Central Unit responsible for crimes committed at the municipal level, which, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, mainly of companies linked to the detainees, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who may have played a mediator role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential complex in the city of Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, a real estate agency, Conycase, a car park manager for Coruna, Venezuela streets and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigo, Hogartel, a direct marketing specialist, and Preconiza, a sales, promotion and assembly company for building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent found this comment in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: Helsingin Sanomat (certainly headed by the PISA report on the level of education in the world), referring to what was published on November 18 at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy at Jokela High School.
In his messages, the killer quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the Education Counsellor responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye, adding that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important in compulsory elementary philosophy classes in secondary schools.

One of your colleagues informs us that there is an Internet download offence in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song is a crime and is punishable from six months to one year.
However, stealing a disc worth less than 400 euros in a store is only a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal at a store for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty for the theft is still below the penalty for downloading it online (Art. 234 BTC).
C. If you steal a car and take it back after 40 hours, the penalty is still below the penalty for downloading it online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass fight, you may be punished by a penalty of three months to a year (Art. 154 BTK), but for copying a CD you may be punished by a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the BTK).
According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the author’s consent is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My general practitioner gave me an article about strange research that read: “Money causes brain activity, especially when others have less of it.”
That is, the feelings of employees on a payday depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonance tomography, and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, “the strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly and the partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if both responded correctly and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if either of them received double the amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science for such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing Balkan war criminals relentlessly for eight years from the office of Prosecutor of the Criminal Court in The Hague, former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste, as the culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, that is, General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, not yet released in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor general, like a real crime, from Belgrade to New York, as she tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to tighten the loop around the fleeing criminals.
What kind of insurance suits me?
Car insurance, which provides security for the owner of the car against various damages, involves significant expenses and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and nature of use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding which car you want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, stating that the insurance company shall pay compensation for the fixed premium in the event of the event of damage.
The insurance premium is basically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and others.
Insurance companies determine the premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by the person who presents a higher accident risk.
That’s why people over 25, or women, pay less, because statistics show they’re less at risk because they’re more cautious.
Similarly, insurance companies have concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
When it comes to the type of use of the car, the frequency is crucial.
More frequent use increases the chance of an accident.
When determining the premium, insurance companies take a number of factors into account.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look into it in order to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors for the choice, in order to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to establish an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 are faced with a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of their driving licence.
Although it is most ideal to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers will be able to take out full insurance with you, so they will be insured against all dangers and the price will be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured will pay part of the damage.
"The amount of self-insurance paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-insurance," says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, an online insurance broker in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, be careful and avoid accidents, as this will affect the bonus and reduce your future payouts.
Bonuses are defined as discounts in relation to the basic rate of the insurance company.
The penalty abolished in relation to the basic rate is called a malus.
"The amount of bonus and malus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the amount of the bonus," Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year-old age limit has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
We advise you to take out full insurance with you.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in the event of an accident, even while driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fears of beginners.
If the insured is already married but has no children yet, it is best to take out a full insurance policy, of course, if your financial means allow it.
Insurance companies consider couples with children to be the least risky clients, and therefore the premium payable in their case is lower.
In this case, it is best to have full insurance with a self-supply (which can reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300), or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend the insurance to damages caused to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share," says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, we recommend full insurance with a self-supply (about 150 euros), or it can be extended to liability insurance with a higher bonus.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the owner in the event of damages, but also because it involves a large amount of expense, so it is essential to choose the appropriate form of personalized insurance.
Celtic wants to score points in Milan to qualify for the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will compete at San Siro stadium on Tuesday to win the missing point at the end of the Champions League, allowing the Italians to be first and the Scottish to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round they secured a tie with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but it would take one more to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will be fighting Benfica with four points, from overtaking.
The two matches of Group D will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championships, where he will try to advance to the 16th final in the 13th semi-final.
Group D will end sooner than the others, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be a draw, the two teams are striving to win, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan’s team is still defeated enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but you can’t be sure of that, because if there’s a scoring tie, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but won the next match (2-0) will go on.
The Italians will try to make the night worse for the Scots, who would like to enter the reorganized Champions League in the eighth final twice in a row, after just there they scored a goal from Kaka in the extension following a 0-0 draw (1-0) in the previous season.
Shakhtar would be delighted to win the Rossonerik because if Celtic loses, he will be in the eighth final and stay in UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite being in the last place at the moment and having no chance of staying in the European championship, can still take third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver (Canada), performing in front of 20,000 spectators for the first time since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) at the GM Place in Vancouver just minutes before the concert, they announced that the band had a "beautiful form".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, and a video was shown about the great success of the band in the 1990s.
With the band reunited and the tour, EMI also released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls came on stage wearing a bracelet from their husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowded auditorium of GM Place, although Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has not seen our dress yet, so I'm nervous about what she'll think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other." He also seemed nervous during the press conference that took place two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw how people felt about the Spice Girls changed.
I thought, why not? Now I’m glad I made that decision,” Chisholm said about the band, which had been disbanded nine years earlier.
The singer also added that in the meantime, "things have been arranged and we love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV, the band arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
A group of babysitters were waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have seven children in total.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California, USA, San Jose (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
The show will take place in Madrid on December 23.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has re-emerged, which could also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transported through Ukraine, and disputes between the two nations are always under great scrutiny.
Kiev has said that if Moscow raises the gas price to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also impose higher transit costs on Russia.
As a result of a previous dispute between the two countries last year, supplies to the EU countries have decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is related to an attempt by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, to reach an agreement on the price of gas to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom said it would have to increase its gas production from neighbouring Turkmenistan by 50% compared to the price agreement with Ukraine in 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% price increase for Ukraine from Gazprom.
"It is important that during the negotiations we reason in accordance with one of the most important gas transit states," Ukraine's economic minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
Changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the cost of transit through Ukraine (and to Western Europe).
As a result of the most recent major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas tap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed prices up to a large extent.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s gas supply.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will supplement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet states.
The NHS is “obligated to monitor foreign workers”
Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of criminal records of workers coming from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was put forward by Chief Accountant Robert Black after a foreign-citizen doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of its overseas employees.
At the same time, in its report, it also pointed out, through a sample of five health authorities, key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the Chief Auditor checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors accused of attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom in October of being interrogated by the Old Bailey court via video link.
NHS committees must verify the qualifications and work experience of their overseas employees before starting employment, as well as their availability of the necessary permits to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish health committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not authorized to obtain such information from outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor suggested, inter alia, that the committees should introduce a guide to the Criminal Records Office, which would facilitate the employer’s verification processes with the various overseas countries.
"Although we found evidence of such checks in staff records, they are not regularly carried out," the report said.
Black said the Scottish NHS is performing its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, adding: “Our report highlights areas of the system that can be improved in order to have up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas personnel.”
According to Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, it is “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could be used to identify potential NHS employees who may be committing terrorist acts in the future.
“According to the report, the pre-employment controls currently applied in the NHS Scotland work well, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the ECA pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly due to the difficulties encountered by committees in identifying staff on indefinite leave.
The investigation also revealed a high degree of co-ordination of the control procedures implemented by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian.
These procedures included the verification of passports, work permits and certificates of qualification.
The Scottish government is currently examining a policy and guidance on pre-employment inspections for NHS overseas employees.
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I am very pleased that this task has been accomplished following the attack on Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and ensure that the updated guide to pre-employment inspections for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. The updated version is scheduled to be published next month.
Joy Division wins at the awards ceremony
"Control", a biopic of Joy Division's late singer Ian Curtis, has swept five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis played Curtis, and director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell also won the award.
Dame Judi Dench won Best Actress for the thriller "Details of a Scandal".
The Variety Award was given to Daniel Craig, who played Bond, for putting the British film in the international spotlight.
The awards were given during a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" depicts the rise of Curtis within the Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The film, which included "The Killers", "David Bowie" and "New Order on the soundtrack", cost only <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for making the U2's "Joshua Tree" album cover, received two awards: Best Director and Best Startup Director.
Another winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple’s film about Joe Strummer, the Clash singer, won the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor Award for his role as the driver of the London-based thriller David Cronenberg’s Mob boss Killing Promises.
Ray Winstone won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose names include the films "Scum", "Éhkoppon" and "Sexy Dog", is currently involved in the filming of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after Harris, the star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" who passed away in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened their doors," Winstone said.
“I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
“Richard Harris’ style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time, and I respect him very much.”
The selection of the independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 terrorist cellular militants who planned to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility and several attacks on church officials and security forces.
According to state television, the world’s largest oil exporter, one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
An eight-member cell led by a foreign citizen is planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After the 2006 attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect the facilities.
According to a report citing the words of the Interior Minister, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "specialized missile launcher" who illegally crossed the border.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees were plotting to assassinate church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to stop the Saudis from joining Al Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting against allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, the latter being regarded as heretical by Saudi hardline Sunni.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a large number of Saudi ecclesiastical leaders as being involved by the authorities in supporting the royal family’s policies.
The group's fighters, instigated by Saudi-born Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's call for a targeting of the pro-Western government in Saudi Arabia, aimed at attacking foreign resident settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"Security forces have made tremendous efforts over the past five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-member "media cell" was also captured with the aim of spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims who are branded as unfaithful and apostate.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of financial support for the militants.
The climate of Venus could provide a glimpse into the future of Earth
Scientists said that Venus was once a place to live.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is more likely to be considered the Earth’s capricious twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are almost the same in size and have similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
As scientists now know, billions of years ago, Venus may have had very similar living conditions to Earth, and even habitable conditions.
However, due to the exceptionally high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and reduced planetary rotational speed, Venus has entered a completely different evolutionary path.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and it is devastated by hurricane-strength winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year-long study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Begin to figure out why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar in structure.
“Our new data has made it possible to develop a scenario of how Venus evolved billions of years ago, when it might have had Earth-like habitable conditions.
"Enriched Uranium" Seized by Police
A kilogram of radioactive material - uranium enriched according to reports - was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480.000).
Widely open doors
Mitt Romney says he’s not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Republican candidates for the presidential election, however, agreed to participate in a debate broadcast on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions put on Wednesday night on November 28 turned out to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a debate broadcast by the other party on YouTube.
The questions and answers, however, this time reflected the position of the Republican Party approaching the election next year.
It is not yet known exactly how the CNN executives who co-financed the debate selected the YouTube clips submitted to the nominees.
The longest topic in the first half hour of the debate was immigration.
This is one of the republicans’ tricks.
CNN has asked some insecure voters to dial a number if they find it promising: the mediator experienced a high level of agreement when candidates spoke out loud on the issue of borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, a national leader, and Romney, who was pushing ahead in the decisive primary elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to change his image of being too frivolous in dealing with illegal immigration during his mayorship in New York City.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The clamor between the two became particularly fierce when questioners asked about the support for an "amnesty" (which would guarantee illegal immigrants permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter from California and Tom Tancredo from Colorado, have been able to dig deep into the issue.
And although none of them are eligible for the nomination, their staying on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they started ringing the bell of immigration earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: the common goal is to strengthen the borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like fear of Chinese toxic toys and other worrisome factors from the outside world, is helping Republicans within the country to forget or minimize the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani faced the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney have debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner asked whether the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
Giuliani stumbled at this point and finally clung to the view that, although he considered the Bible to be his favorite book, he might not interpret the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who took the first place in the recent Iowa election and won his victory thanks to his steadfast Christian conservatism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for election.
The competition is unusually open.
Huckabee’s upsurge in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul’s fundraising campaign and the enthusiastic cheering that surrounded him in Wednesday’s debate.
The sudden outburst of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to nominate a common candidate from the more familiar and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who uttered the message of victory proclaiming America’s greatness in a timely and convincing manner, and who found common ground with both wings of the party.
However, the party is now divided, and the consequences of this are currently unforeseen.
Labour's Pain
Another gap opens before Gordon Brown; the way out remains unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current one does not seem too picky.
No one sold his honor, no politician found the Paris hotel bills, no one committed an out-of-marriage scandal.
But the discovery that for more than four years a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, made a disguised contribution of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3 million) to the British Labour Party, and that the party did not report on this, was one of the things without which the besieged Gordon Brown would have prospered.
Two months ago, when the prime minister got away with the election, and when he recklessly questioned the British’s intellectual capacity by saying that polls did not influence the outcome of the decision, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, however, as Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, remarked with increasingly witty remarks, transformed from the once feared Brown Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The failure to rescue Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and lack of judgment into a crossfire.
The sickly proposals to amend the tax law encouraged business stakeholders to unite against the government.
The loss of the personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities has revealed unimaginably high levels of administrative clutter.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals incited a riot to protest against the reduction of the military budget, declaring that the position of Secretary of Defense is part-time.
And now here are the mysterious gifts of David Abrahams; Labour Secretary-General Peter Watt (formerly Administrative Director) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where control becomes impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the prime minister is unlikely to be able to move things forward and may not remain in office for a long time, the suspended infidelity is over: the public officials begin to leak, the cabinet ministers go to briefings, the press looks for bad news; and the government starts to defend and is unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered “fresh blood.”
As much as he wanted to deny his connection to Tony Blair, he was his right-hand man.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown during his time as Treasury Secretary.
And although Blair’s missteps – such as the prolonged investigation of the relationship between the “nobility for money” and political party funding – were not directly involved, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is indeed unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
Mistakes committed are not as frightening as they appear in the towers.
As with Mr. Bean, no one was killed, no one was fooled directly.
Compensation, however painful it may be, can be the creation of the trends that Stalin, who lives in Brown, has always promised: reliable, firm and somewhat hard-handed governance.
A good example of this is political donation.
The Garboian mystical Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want his good deeds to be revealed to the public.
Perhaps that is the case, but the decision was not in his hands.
The law banning the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the population has the right to know who is knocking at the gates of the country’s rulers.
Watt, who said he knew about Abrahams’ actions, but was not aware of the illegal nature of them, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations; as did Jon Medleson, the Labour Party’s foundation manager, who was informed of the confused donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, has no lead for the time being: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these spins, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has fulfilled half of his duties.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, his firmness was diluted by the fact that he had resorted to a familiar instrument; in order to investigate the matter, he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the "learning lesson" is not too complicated.
In the event of a breach of the law, the police are competent.
Brown also has other issues to address, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules, which has been without a leader for six months, or advancing an effective reform of party funding.
This would require the hard-haired Labour Party to cooperate with the tori and break with the special financial ties associated with the associations - that would be a hard wall for the party-loyal Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, conservatives are currently leading with a major advantage; Brown has two years to recapture voters; the only way to win is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card Sharks
Is the second-market mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weak, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market could lose up to <0x24>99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-down rate indicating the ratio of loans that cannot be recovered and the default rate indicating the ratio of late payments over 30 days have increased.
HSBC reported a loss of <0x24>1.4 billion last month in the U.S. consumer finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
However, panic is premature.
The rate of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% calculated by Moody's for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency practitioners, but also in large losses in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus the write-off ratio) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the overall conditions for borrowing deteriorate or not.
The payment rate, which shows the percentage of monthly consumer credit repayments, is also solid in the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney, of the TowerGroup research firm, estimates that emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the movement of money rather than the value of assets, so a fall in home prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors can benefit from this situation.
If the value of the property is less than the value of the mortgage loan, consumers will be less encouraged to repay the loan; as a result, repayment of debts on credit cards will be prioritised.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt more quickly and flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-pricing of assets.
"It's unlikely that we'll wake up one day to completely revalue our loans," said Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much higher.
If the fall in housing prices and the decline in lending drive America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly have a harsh future ahead of it.
It's worth watching those predatory fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to trial to investigate their involvement in fraud involving Enron's former CFO Andrew Faston have pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent of the seven-order fraud allegedly involving Fastow in a covert scam committed in 2000 to make money at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, at a court hearing before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them pleaded guilty to one-off fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in the UK during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into Enron’s collapse in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers, nicknamed the "NatWest Triple", were charged with traveling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare for the scam together with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was Fastow's right-hand man at the time.
Fastow, who was responsible for the many frauds that led to the bankruptcy of Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its holdings in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s <0x24>1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper <0x24>250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying the <0x24>20 million subsidiary stake from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the <0x24>20 million hit the marks of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers received <0x24>7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received <0x24>12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his role in Enron's collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper serves three years and a month in a prison in Texas.
The three British men were allowed to travel to the United States for <0x24>1 million each in bail.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks that could no longer cover up the millions of debts it had accumulated and the profit-making but in fact loss-making businesses it had claimed.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, the market value decreased by more than <0x24>60 billion and the value of pension funds decreased by more than <0x24>2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder and former CEO of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year of complicity in the company’s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other accusations against Lay ended with the man's death last year.
No Poverty in Moscow
At <0x24>54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine will take the flight between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a single tank.
But for some rich Russians, this amount is only a small amount of money.
"It can accommodate 18 passengers," Gulfstream representative Dan Firer said.
"But no one orders so many seats, because the machines are bought for private families or business leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day, exclusive Millionaire Fair, which was held in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that Russian newcomers would be interested in everything from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-coated grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche exhibited at the booth next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not in the tracks of our products," he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
The Russian capital seems to be floating in money like Dallas did at its height during the oil price explosion.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s when a few American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered to be their money,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, Davis.
Like Saudi Arabian and Japanese gamblers of the 1970s and 1990s, the Russians are now among the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organized by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people, there are 53 billion people in Russia with a total of <0x24>282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, with a total of <0x24>670 billion, according to a study conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, which analyses personal well-being development in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, the number of people living below the minimum subsistence in Russia in 2005 was 15.8 percent.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole participated in the trade fair for the first time with the brand’s Russian distributor Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all impeccablely groomed, and men are a treasure trove."
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, roaming the halls in Sunday evening dresses, attributed themselves and their clients to a millionaire.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who was brazenly swinging in her custom-designed outfit, as if she was accustomed to it.
The fair is primarily for the newly rich, for brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to go around a draughty, cifran-decorated venue after several hours in traffic, where you can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, regular billiard tables, and apartments in Dubai.
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros (<0x24>44.57).
"Russia likes to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a patriotic look at the Royal Delft porcelain maker's stall, as opposed to a wall-sized, hand-decorated Rembrandt imitation painted on blue tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the long-time rich Russians (according to Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) had already passed from the eccentric logos to the bagatelles, limited editions of brands that would not get into a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires' commissioners and tourists, filled the area with crowds every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil beds, said he sold two <0x24>70,000 worth of silk, cashmere and cotton beds that were woven with gold thread.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales associate of the A1 Moto, which provides high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for <0x24> 170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that provides a custom-made solution, sold three grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble connected chain bracelets and cost <0x24>55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said was covered with Swarovski crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is <0x24>22,000.
“A Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather and a picture of his wife’s face made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily use these objects,” Karapetian said.
"They'll be guarded in the garage of 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian said the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely now a millionaire, if not in money, at least on paper,” he said.
"They're more than you think."
Those who aren’t millionaires could at least appear to be wealthy in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone booths, which have been heaped with millions of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes at the Millionaire Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and had their mobile phones take pictures of themselves sliding around with the money, or just putting a few million dollars in their pockets.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgical failure suspected behind death in New Jersey
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out of the flat glass window of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop two doors down West Scott Avenue on Cape Cod.
A police patrol car arrived shortly afterwards.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr Livingston, one of the inspectors at the restaurant.
“I knew someone was dead.”
Authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo, who had previously worked as a senior assistant to the Newark Police Director.
An investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon working at West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the toxicological test results that will be available in a few weeks' time will reveal the mysterious death that has devastated senior Newark police officers.
Arroyo, whose voice was widely known in the department, has been working as an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and trustworthy," McCarthy said in a phone interview with Arroyo on Wednesday.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who currently worked for the Spirituous Products Control Committee, and left behind two boys, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were investigating whether Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorized surgeon.
"There's a probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
According to the authorities, they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. in November.
The 21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was declared dead on the spot.
It’s been more than a week, and the police have yet to reveal very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro had been heard by the investigators.
Participants in the study investigated whether a part of the house functioned as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro’s home, where a dead rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barking from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the basement, in the car entrance, there was a blue tank with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks to the sides.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in helping her to navigate the unusual and unpolished political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'It's better to be careful with this and that,'" he said.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always inside when I left at night.
It was embarrassing.”
Expectations of the Fed’s interest cuts lead to a storm in the world’s stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after reassuring statements by the Deputy Governor of the U.S. Central Bank raised hopes that the Fed would try to ease investment opportunities by further interest cuts.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have fluctuated after Donald Kohn, who is the right hand of Fed president Ben Bernanke, said managers had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal of calming the markets in the face of the signs of a rebounding credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest “partly reversed the development of the market in late September and October.”
If the increased confusion persists, he said, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and corporations.
The statements were interpreted by investors to mean that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets or even further interest rate cuts in order to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements have also reassured Wall Street, which has recently been hit by a number of bad news about the US economy, including a negative record in the number of US home sales.
The side effect of the financial turmoil was confirmed by an announcement by Bear Stearns investment bank that, as part of the cost cuts, it will lay off 650 employees and 4% of its global workforce to offset the losses in the U.S. second-market housing sector.
A total of 20 jobs at the headquarters in London, which employs 1,500 people, are affected by this measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6.306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British blue-chip companies.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The turmoil in the credit market resurfaced after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank brought three-month securities to European banks at a price of 4.7 percent, the size of which had not been seen since April 2001.
After the British interbank interest rate, Libor, reached its highest level since September, at 6.59 percent, after steadily increasing since November 12, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital to the London money market.
England demands decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who will have the English team six jersey in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who makes the decision?
On the one hand, the latter question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection team, who temporarily carries out this particular task, is assisting head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and on the other hand, because the desk of the English executive director Hugh Morris's desk is getting full of requests for a national, or at least one-time, selection post.
The shortest of the two players is the one who doesn’t get the sixth spot, but as you know, life, and especially sports, are often unfair.
It is never easy to say how one reaches the peak of one’s vocation, while others cannot overcome it even at a lower level. Often it is more about luck than talent.
It is not only cricket that is difficult to select, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated young leaders with a good understanding of business, are put before decision-makers, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell what level a cricket player can reach without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious tournament?
Of course, data has a big impact on the decision, but opportunities are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain’s eye at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batter must regularly be given a chance if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the eye of the pickers is a lot more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, played better last season, but he is definitely a member of the team at the first test, despite Stephen Harmison saying he is in good shape and doing a very good punch.
Anderson won the tour with 32 first-class goal kicks and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only beat 29, but both of them have had success moments at the highest level and hope to continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided on the basis of their opinions.
This decision can boost or break anyone’s career, but it can also have no particular impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played all the tests and scored well with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was the then emerging Paul Collingwood who became an outstanding and defining test cricketer, who may still be underestimated even today, despite having scored double hundred points against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that in their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following their conservative intuition, will vote for Shah's greater experience, against Bopara's young vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is in favor of his bright and successful debut in the 88 Bombay test quarters, as opposed to Bopara's 22-year-old six, who is seven years younger than him, who also scored 32 first-class hundreds in excellent twist throws.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only ten races in two quarters against the West Indies at home in May at the Lorda test, and that Vaughan, struggling for his re-entry in the next game, encountered the immediate resistance of the selectors, seems to have diminished the endurance that was evident to him in Bombay.
Contrary to him, Essex’s universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
There is nothing to upset him at the cricket court, but he characterized his out-of-court behavior well when he rolled over at an exhibition with a four-wheel drive from Volkswagen, the team’s car sponsor.
However, the first thing he did after that was to pick up Vodafone's (naturally sponsored) phone and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better player on the edge of the pitch with his sliding mids. He creates an advantageous throwing angle with his sliding mids, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I would give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn’t mean that I don’t think Shah would be outstanding if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one to play this weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by bus to work and fight Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad have been arriving with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or visas, or those who hope that order has been restored in the city.
There are also some of them who have returned to fight with the soldiers who had driven them out of their houses.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning home from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people arriving from Damascus filled dozens of buses.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the militant minister Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently shutting down his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from predominantly Sunni-populated Amaryah, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from working.
Amarijai Shiite neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying they had succeeded in pushing Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the western part of the capital with the help of American-backed troops.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed the support of me and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the peace that has been strengthened in the capital since the invasion of U.S. troops and the fact that they have been lured home by armed civilian forces cooperating with the U.S..
However, more people were forced to return home from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-childr Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a widespread view among refugees that Shia Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to refuse the refugees’ visa requests in order to force their return.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have fled death squads operating in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and pressured the government not to issue any more visas to Iraqis in order for them to move home," he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I escaped.”
One of the reasons for the easing of violence is that the Sunni were driven out of the Shiite areas, while the Shiites were also leaving the Sunni-inhabited areas.
Many fear that the sudden emergence of refugees may upset the mood again, which may even lead to new fighting.
Small Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal state is a leader in professional training, and its higher education is internationally oriented.
Only in one area of training, the islanders are struggling with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday for the fiftieth time, I explained to a person outside the Saarland that we are not French," this self-ironic slogan is postered on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which, according to surveys by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, is ranked fifth.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even for the sake of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students can still complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is high with its own 15.6 percent.
However, Saarland’s colleges and universities also have an above-average attraction for those who want to study in the Saarland – many of them do not have high school education.
"The Saarland is taking advantage of the opportunities offered by professional training," explains Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than one-fifth of young people receive the right to further education in vocational schools, which means that the Saarland exceeds the federal average by more than seven per cent.
The combination of vocational and higher education opportunities are also well developed.
The dual study infrastructure ranks second in terms of population in Germany.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the Saarland therefore obliged higher education institutions to conduct a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
“A number of reforms have been initiated in primary schools since the first Pisa study,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that in the meantime has also begun to be copied by other federal states.
Whether students’ performance will improve permanently will only be answered by future comparative studies.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk has shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
However, Saarland’s overall performance did not improve to the same extent as that of the other Länder.
The Bavarians count better.
To the greatest annoyance of the islanders, the knowledge of foreign languages is not taken into account during the Pisa survey – otherwise they could be rewarded in this area,
The language of the neighbouring countries is a must in high schools, even if the islanders are not French.
Chávez is changing the clocks.
In the near future, the clocks in Venezuela will run differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will reset the qualifying in the Latin American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez became the object of ridicule in Spain.
According to the official Venezuelan newspaper, the clocks will be reversed by four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will become part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-U.S. leader, Chávez, argued that time zones based on hours were imposed on the world by the United States.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the breaking of ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage incident.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain any contact with the president or the Colombian government.
"I can't do that for my own dignity," Chávez said, calling for a constitutional reform that the people of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to engage in talks with Colombian Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
With his decision, Uribe "spitted" on Venezuela, voiced his criticism of Chavez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
There was a new mobile ringtone in the country: "Por que no te llamas" -- that's the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from King Charles John of Spain, who at the last Latin American summit was so upset by the constant shouts of the populist politician from Balolda that he blurted out.
Germans are facing wage cuts in 2007
According to a forecast, the real wages of German workers are at risk of falling this year despite the strong economic downturn.
Experts have backed up their pessimistic predictions with a bunch of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007, employees could actually expect to be paid less than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the rapid rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research.
There may also be additional burdens on workers in connection with unemployment insurance.
Finance minister Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the “New Osnabrücker Zeitung” that it would be appropriate and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the start of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply to the Alliance for loans or subsidies, they quoted a politician from the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price boom for food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
On a year-on-year basis, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is Earth's Devil's Twin
Despite its harsh atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has detected lightning strikes in its atmosphere, and wind turbulences around its poles, such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that lightning is on Venus.
The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has provided evidence - electromagnetic waves have been detected on the periphery of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the columns of the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "old soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been in the very early days," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there can hardly be any living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it is her twin," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, is on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus exploration, because since the early 1990s no probe has been specifically on the way to find this planet.
The latest findings, presented in several Nature articles, suggest that Venus is more than unique in the solar system.
"They also point to the fact that the neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than we initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known Arctic whirlwind, the researchers have discovered a cloud vortex moving much faster in the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the Earth’s winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth, and a diameter of 12,100 kilometers is almost the size of Earth.
The star, also known as the Morning Star, orbits the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the surface temperature of Venus, coupled with a pressure of 92 bar, is barely reminiscent of Earth, scientists have assumed that both planets were formed under exactly the same conditions.
Both of them accumulated water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus left for the universe.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus, it is a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler to defend Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands the end of the party debate that broke out around the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s prestige and has called on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama’s reception.
"In this matter, we should not be presented as a divided nation to the outside world," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
Köhler at the same time expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) had received the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to take care of the delicate balance in foreign policy, the president stressed; however, Merkel defended herself against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional 'one China' policy.
China is aware of this," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier indirectly expressed disapproval of the Dalai Lama's reception and became the target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "window policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's office, there were fierce disturbances in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only withdrew the invitation of German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two foreign ministries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects official reception of Tibetan religious leader by European politicians, Wen Jiabao said.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan territories that include Tibet and other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not lead to street violence, the Federal Interior Minister demands.
Barricades burned, rifles fired rifles at police: After serious riots among young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives do not accumulate in our country and end up in violence.
We need to take this seriously," he told the Hannover newspaper "Neue Presse".
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving the problem cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have already been demonstrated."
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that German suburbs do not have the same urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, in recent nights, young people have fought heavy street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Taking all this into account, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded more activity from the federal government in relation to integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Yet action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is "higher than average".
First and foremost, more educational space should be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to provide a perspective for young people.”
The head of the Turkish Community, however, added that "intra-family social supervision" is more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "We must be on guard."
Young people should be given the opportunity to work and receive education as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete calm throughout the night.
Hundreds of police officers were standing by, scanning the area with a helicopter headlight.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as some burning garbage dumps and cars.
Since the reporting, a security unit of around 1,000 people has provided peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday, about 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots broke out following a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor’s first findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Cloudwalker in Angela's Kingdom
The chancellor’s unrealistic action is proof that the coalition is coming to an end – and nothing can be expected of him either.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
Following the bleak, indifferent and meaningless action taken by the Bundestag in the general debate, it must be stated that he does not live here - not in the country whose government is his responsibility.
Angela Merkel dismissed the accusation with a very overwhelming statement, saying she was too focused on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he does not want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how fitting the reproaches are.
In the meantime, there was no concrete interest or empathy in the problems of the country.
Instead, Angela the Cloud has appeared: a politician who has run away from reality, who flees into foreign policy, and even there, she has nothing but uncertainty.
Example of climate protection: He uncontrollably praises himself for the Heiligendamm Decisions, but is silent about how to achieve the climate change targets in the country.
As far as self-respect is concerned, this degree of modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years earlier.
He now clings to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This damages his reputation as a pragmatic person who solves problems instead of words.
In Angela's realm, however, the domestic political problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
It is worth only a few half sentences.
From this point of view, it is telling how often he stumbles when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel will have to push three times to get a half-clean sentence together.
When it comes to specifics, he stumbles on a foreign territory.
Storm Division
During the debate on Youtube, Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, were hit hard – and now they have to be afraid of an outsider.
The tension between the candidates has already surfaced on the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Who, for his part, contradicts serious facts: 'I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants', reprimands Giuliani and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants as private workers.
As the Republican camp still lacks a unified favorite, the eight presidential candidates will use the debate on CNN to undermine their opponent’s credibility.
Self-recorded 30-second videos uploaded by internet users via Youtube are little more than short summaries.
“This is the kind of isolationism we have used to bring Hitler to power,” says John McCain to his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only person in the circle to demand immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
A Vietnam veteran has also thoroughly washed Romney’s head when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called “Waterboarding” as torture, a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
That the important topics of the campaign, in the meantime, lie beyond Iraq and the debate about torture, is illustrated by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
There will be loud applause in the hall for the praise of conservative values and the rejection of future tax increases.
In the meantime, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more evident.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for having voted for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is shaken when asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf to rule as a civilian for the first time
The day after his resignation from the military, Musharraf was sworn in as President of Pakistan.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a further five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the Presidential Palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his trustee, Ashfaq Kiyani, thus yielding to international pressure, first and foremost from the United States.
Eight years after the ex-general took power without shedding blood in the form of a military coup, he is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With Musharraf's resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on 3 November.
Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would end the state of emergency shortly after he was sworn in, fulfilling a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had appointed lawyers sympathetic to him after the state of emergency was declared in early November, rejected all protests last week regarding the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, an attack on a military convoy in northern Vaziristan, a tribal area in the north, killed five soldiers and injured four others.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The fathers of krautrock are back.
The German supergroup of the 1970s is playing again: The three members of the Harmonia have dusted their instruments for a concert in Berlin.
During the reunion, a cut from the era of "Live 1974" appears.
At the time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation takes the form of the three settled gentlemen who sit around the dinner table.
Each has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
From the left, Michael Rother, a 57-year-old, will accompany you with a laptop and a guitar.
Looking from the right, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius bends and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, while also occasionally rhythm.
Sometimes it just happens to be traditional music.
However, all this does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the krautrock music trend that the Harmonia band will be playing again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has slipped through the collective pop memory, but by no means has left any lasting traces that make this band painfully missing after 32 years.
Why can’t the Germans celebrate the legends of their 70s?
Especially since what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in his own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for his life’s work to the remaining members of the Can in Cologne in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers even thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their laudation, the amazement became limitless.
During the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
Memory is overwhelmed by Harmonia only because the trio existed only for two years, and during this time it had a far lesser effect than that which was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius have already performed with Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a church-funded record label.
Rother helped Kraftwerk for a short time, and at the same time he gained a reputation as a guitarist for the perhaps most radical German band at the time, Neu!.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rom, they lived as communists who fled the city.
Less ideologically than in the 1st Commune, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artist.
It is said that the Harmonia Ottenstein's flag was found in the garbage, and in this way they found a name for their art.
Some of these are recorded by Harmony.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one is titled "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band was in financial need.
The collection of rhubarbs alone did not ensure that you would find yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of less than 50 people, so someone remembers.
Forcing and practicing Harmony occasionally was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band dissolved in 1975.
Rother ended up with esoterics and sustained himself from albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
The live album from Griessem is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Greenland label set itself the goal of caring for the krautrock as a unique German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been excavated in the same way as Roedelius’s solo work.
The Resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the British ancestor and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
Also present is Loveparade’s founder, Dr. Motte.
All this broadly outlines the impact of krautrock on the following pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills the vacant space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement floats with the most unusual sounds in the room: "The only true music is his future."
There are pictures depicting the producer with the Harmonia in a farmhouse room.
The projection of additional black-and-white photographs of cluttered wired equipment serves to build legends.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means mounting microphones to the organ and drum equipment with the intention of extracting sound effects from the instruments with the help of instruments that produce sound effects that have not yet been heard.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three craftsmen, technicians.
Even the house choir doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and buzz and sing "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been an English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music colleges (Can), in the technical know-how (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If anyone here cries "'68!" he will not be on a completely wrong path, and the Harmony will not allow itself to be shaken out of its calm even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thought through on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can either upset you nerve-wise, or give you the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
Through "Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", there are again two films dealing with the Balkan War.
None of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too sentimental.
Not even Richard Gere himself can help with "Hunting."
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they have found actor Richard Gere back in the dark countryside of the Bosnian War.
Recently, we’ve lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, as many of his good-natured roles in emotional films for women and numerous press conferences on Buddhism even took us away from looking at him.
And all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most compelling argument for perhaps watching the movie "Hunting."
It offers a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt, who he played, is exactly what Gere would have been if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious to him: A man who had long left his most beautiful years behind, but as a ruined monument to his decline, retained much of his former attractiveness.
However, the film "Hunting" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also started to be screened this week, continue, despite this adage, only an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that for once the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film, which carries the shallowness of television films, is lost too quickly in shootings and action-packed scenes.
"Cobra 11" is a sign of war instead of highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "Hunting" it is exemplary to examine why no really good film about the Balkan war has actually been made.
The story of the three U.S. war correspondents who are advancing in search of the Serb war criminal "The Fox", with a different director, a different screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) might have turned into a new "Apocalypse Now" in a different era.
The stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups set out into the woods to do what the army can’t do – and in both cases, the journey leads to madness.
One of the reasons why "Hunting" fails is that he simply won't let Simon Hunt, who listens to his heart, be the depraved cynic he describes at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he also spends a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
The "Hunting" will slip away when reporters in the last five minutes of the film get what NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters couldn't do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would prefer to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is profoundly human.
He intends to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large and accuses the Americans and the French of not pursuing the persecution with sufficient intensity due to secret political bargaining.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that one thinks of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes of the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I stare with contrition upon his temple the bulging vein which tells me how tiring it is to be bad."
Films like "Hunting" have similarly oversized, human head-shaped masks that show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the war in the Balkans.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all the films about Iraq in Hollywood were a ugly failure.
There hasn’t been a good movie about South Africa yet.
Almost always valid: When a star wanders through the world’s crisis areas or minefields, it turns into something like “The Paths of Freedom” with Patricia Arquette, “Without Borders” with Angelina Jolie, or “Blood Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close from the point of view of time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to be able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List".
Probably some of the movies will get done - because the classics of the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket", were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it’s possible that nowadays, when all the mass murders come to our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that deprives scriptwriters of the ignorance of reality that would be needed to tell good stories.
After all, "Being or Not to Be" or "The Dictator" did so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't be striving for the good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to put ourselves in the sarcasticly distant artistic perspective of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière Lexicon" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It depends only on the fact that certain things never change.
“The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in terrible ways, and Yugoslavia will always be dominated by war.”
Von Beusto is strongly criticized for resigning from the Olympics
The mayor’s detachment from his application for the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has sparked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the water games.
However, Von Beust warns strongly of the reality of the odds.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said the retreat was "unfavourable for the economic environment".
No other project has recently unleashed such a powerful motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, we would not be able to sustain the momentum of the sporting policy to an even degree.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that "comes from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted that Hamburg’s ambitions for the Olympic Games would be unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the federation's decision on the Munich competition for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which was expected to take place in early December.
“To give this priority to us means that we will have no realistic chances in the period we have planned so far, up to 2028.”
However, we will not give up the dream forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) has expressed regret over von Beust’s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to miss an opportunity to bury our plans now," HSB president Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application runs counter to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception at the General German College Sports Association’s general meeting.
There, the competition submitted to the von Beust Hamburg University in 2015 described it as not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The SPD's bourgeois faction blamed the Senate for leaving unused valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and did not build housing,” said SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to push for an integrated plan for the Olympic and subsequent housing use of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The competition for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg has sparked a lot of enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the concepts of Sweden and falada is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates produced in Sweden cast a dark shadow on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box listed here are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago questioned the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes, the Stockholm Moderna Museet's internal investigation has now come to a sobering conclusion: The Pontus Hultén, former museum director, also donated a further six "Brillo Boxes" in circulation to the Moderna Museet in 1995 - and most likely a hundred "Brillo Boxes" in international art.
Prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial stunts.
Warhol created his first "Brillo Box" in New York in 1964 - wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap powder.
At an exhibition in 1968 at Moderna Museet, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited: These (for cost-saving reasons) did not come from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but their templates, simple exhibits.
However, Warhol gave permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo walls in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak about about fifteen boxes that rightly entered the art and auction history under the designation of the original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm type".
Some of them were auctioned for over <0x24>100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 about 100 wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which were then left to him by Warhol.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 chests were not produced until 1990 for a St. Petersburg exhibition in Malmö.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of Moderna Museet, inspected six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, and three Swedish privately owned boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first flattened and sanded, and the white oil paint was then applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard by means of a paint roller, without any foundation - in addition, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes are not authenticated by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, says: "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will sort the six boxes in its collection as a copy/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it was investigating “serious accusations” of soap dust boxes.
Since then, however, they have remained silent.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Give Up
The rebellion in the Philippines was abandoned by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, said hotel manager Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to that, the hotel was stormed by tear-gazed government soldiers.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday over the failed 2003 coup attempt, including Trillanes.
You used the trial to suddenly unravel 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who had been charged with guarding the man, apparently turned to him and joined the riot.
They infiltrated the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-loyal units have sealed off the neighborhood of the prestigious hotel.
The president has called the security cabinet to an emergency meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"They've had enough of people," said Trillanes.
“We invite people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who was formerly commander of the Scout Rangers, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march shortly afterwards.
Critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been accused of corruption for several months.
As early as 2003, the financial district of Manila was the main scene of an attempted insurrection against Arroyo by some 200 members of the military.
The uprising failed in less than 24 hours, when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet holds more than 20 percent stake in the telecoms company Versatel.
As announced on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46.
This represents 20.05% of the share capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of increasing the shareholding in Versatel remains open.
With this step, they want to help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Previously, there were assumptions on Wednesday about a possible connection, after Berenberg Bank increased its share in the Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5% to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution reserves the share only for a third party, it is reported on the financial market.
The day before, United Internet already owned a narrow 10 percent stake in Drillisch, a mobile phone company.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch issued 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of this, United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the market introduction of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesman for United-Internet said.
The two companies jointly formed the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and are not exercising their right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies, however, leave all options open, especially with regard to increasing their stake in Freenet AG, the news reports.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The poker game that has been around Freenet for months and is now a case-by-case game, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed line customers.
The holding company, formed by United Internet and Drillisch, had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
It is now agreed that Drillisch will bring in an additional four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49% of Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
