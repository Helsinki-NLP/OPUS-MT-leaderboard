Eemeli Kouki leads Hurricane home win at opening - Savo Volley wins second
Hurricane-Loimaa, who won men’s volleyball league medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most powerful player in the hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn’t happen, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
It was done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen, who also played in Loiminku, supported Kouki with 18 points.
Samuli Kaislasalo was the most effective of the guests with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience from the other side, and that added extra to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but continuing the medal pipeline is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley 's
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective with 18 points, when the team defeated the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was swinging, especially in the offensive, but luckily we managed to squeeze the win.
At least I didn’t have any conscious different downloads when I was playing against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Volleyball 3 in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
Good feeling from the home opening.
Miro was the king, Sillik played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver medal in Pielavesi Sampo, while Tuovisen was still the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league point exchange, has also started this season strongly.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after defeating Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun well on its own.
Today we were close to losing, because we were in the fourth round with a loss of 17-21.
They dug up a round victory, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The most effective Tigers in the finals a few seasons ago was the 28-point hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs scored 17 points.
We didn't get much hold of the guy's hacker, Mikkonen boasted.
Finland ranks <0x23>1 in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is at the top of the world in terms of human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was ranked number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is considered.
The World Bank has outlined the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in control, the local game ended without a goal
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched out into brilliant defensive matches, and the Madrid teams' local match ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois was the closest to the goal.
Courtois played for Atletico for three seasons while playing for Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week, FIFA chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
Gareth Bale scored the best goal in Real Madrid, but his shots were passed at the end of the opening half of the goal.
After a break, Bale was switched because of a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real Madrid supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who went to Juventus in the game.
The United States is now under attack on the right to abortion – a powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether the candidate Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many Republicans in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh’s decisive vote will overturn the Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg’s documentary Reversing Roe – The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has come about over the years.
As unbelievable as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support for it from the majority of our country’s parliamentarians.
Colleen McNicholas, a gynaecologist, is the only abortion doctor in Missouri.
An armed guard of the clinic said he defended U.S. religious freedom.
The news videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let’s move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a Lutheran church association guided women to trustworthy abortion doctors.
The pastor’s arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died of a self-made abortion is enough.
In the United States, there were about 5,000 deaths a year.
Abortion was legalized by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, California's law on abortion was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, in his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to confuse religion with politics to attract voters.
His successor, George Bush the Elder, also turned his abortion stance around.
Donald Trump did the same.
The documentary comes to the heart of the matter in search of a root cause for the politicization of abortion.
When segregated religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
They chose abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
At the time of writing this, we are in a situation where the president, who boasted of his oral harassment but captured the voices of the religious right with his abortion, has elected Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now being accused by many women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh will have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million women and girls in the United States.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children, at border protests
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an airstrike on the border zone when demonstrators threw rocks and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says it has begun using force to prevent demonstrators from breaking down the border fence or seeking to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in protests in Gaza since the start of weekly demonstrations at the border in March.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families be allowed access to the territories from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have set fire to forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's top man Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a backhand punch in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackling was clean.
Santa couldn’t believe his eyes.
I think the situation left the referee, Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute after Santa Claus was overthrown.
Ward scored a penalty, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
He has scored five goals for Norwich in the Champions League.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR with a chic chest muscle.
The work tasted like Santa again.
When he lost the ball, he went on until the end.
He made goals and defended tirelessly.
Norwich won the fifth game in two weeks.
The team continues in the league.
There's a five-winning pipe in the back.
The Pedophile Help Service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The SeriE project, jointly organised by the Foundation for the Support of Criminal Welfare and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and to help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails started in Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, and appointments were scheduled very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are expected to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.
The majority of those who perceive pedophilia in themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life,” says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
“I think work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual assault,” Thesleff said.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize – the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize based on the odds of betting.
The background is Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the speech level.
The biggest winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their two countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is remarkable, as it was still cold last year.
Yet, rewarding Kim, who has been threatening his country with nuclear weapons for years and has been leading his country with an iron hand, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced on Monday, and Friday will be the time for the most attention, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to diplomats on the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates will be the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape and has become the world’s leading expert in their field.
Mukwege’s work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 nominees this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself would not mind getting the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter in the White House asked him if he thought he deserved the Peace Prize.
“Everyone thinks that, but I would never say that myself,” Trump said, smiling.
I want to finish this.
"The prize I want is a victory for the whole world," the president said, referring to the talks with North Korea.
However, there are some facts that make Trump’s Nobel improbable.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multipolar world order – the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, the award has been given to three American politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would require an ideological overturn from the Nobel Committee.
Fire warning in tunnel: drivers behaved like cons and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the first road in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted towards both Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Finnish Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are motorists on the road in shock and they drive no matter what happens,” fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen, who was on call, told STT at the time.
At the time, the motorway was driven in the wrong direction, even after only a few moments of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, says Tapio Heiskanen, Liikenneturva’s liaison manager.
According to traffic regulations, motorways and tunnels must not be stopped except for compelling reasons.
Traffic security reminds us that in exceptional situations one cannot start endangering traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be accessible as far as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is forbidden, as is making and reversing a U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels where, in addition, the headlights must always be switched on.
It is also forbidden to stop without compelling reasons, as is of course parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activity in question, Heiskanen says in a Liikenneturva release.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was stuck at the bottom of the lake
Fans of Ilves carried by the inland vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship had been stuck to the bottom of the lake by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s captain at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere drifted out of its route late on Saturday evening and got stuck at the bottom of Vanajavesi in Akaa on the road from Hämeenlinna to Tampere.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland during the night.
Nobody got hurt in the buddy.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until the morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them by the fire department to the harbor and by bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna watching the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s bump was due to the fact that the water level on Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also complicated by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with log waste, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collision
The event took place on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi river shortly after the ferry route had crossed the highway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama involved, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, catching the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship, and the ship’s cruises seem to continue normally.
The diver checked the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship was towed off from the shallow.
We will go to the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise, which will be booked next weekend, can be arranged as agreed.
The ship’s cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
Rescue services received an alert on Saturday night shortly after 11:30 p.m.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
Fire Chief Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and fairly strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after 3:30 p.m. on Sunday night that all passengers on board had been evacuated and transported by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Prosecuted for harassment and drunkenness, Trump’s nominee may not hold the top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the US Supreme Court, may well miss the position he is looking for, says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put the Republican Party under so much political pressure that President Donald Trump may end up proposing someone else.
In the United States, there has been a lot of controversy over the presidential nomination for the Supreme Court.
In this case, the candidate for the judge has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has kept his face.
Appointment to the Democratic Lair
The U.S. Supreme Court tries to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aaltola says the decision is likely to fall into the Democratic party’s lair in the upcoming mid-term elections.
It would raise the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
It is not every presidential term, as the Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request between the ages of 70 and 80.
Some Republicans have hesitated.
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States will normally be subject to background checks, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only set a deadline of one week for further investigation by the FBI, Aaltola said it could reveal something essential.
Yes, it might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
Aaltola said it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for office will be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes a decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are believed to be sceptical of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to a vote and the Republicans would be defeated.
Woman Identifies Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman told the BBC that she identified a Russian man as a Russian military intelligence agent.
The woman said that she was working with military intelligence officer Anatoly Tshepi.
Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously uncovered another of the men suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities are covert identities.
The BBC team travelled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized a young Chepigan from pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in British police photos of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Russian Hero Medal of Honor in 2014.
Russia continues to deny the GRU connection.
In an interview with Russian television in September, the suspected men said they were tourists in Salisbury.
Older people throwing pouches in war reform
Now there is a vivid example of what the change restriction of the social security reform defined by the Sipilä Government means in practice.
My birthplace Vaala’s social services are provided by the Oulankaari municipality, whose health service director was elected in 2016 as the former regional director of Attendo.
The board of directors warns of a change restriction.
If social security spending increases now, the municipality’s state aid will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care in the health centre’s ward and a small unit for those with memory disorders.
In the long-distance Vaala, elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots next to the health centre for treatment at home.
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay its customers.
The Left of Vaala did not swallow bad preparation, but arranged a good public event with many relatives, close nurses and also delegates from other parties.
I showed on the slides of the preparation of the war-province how elderly people are already being treated at home in the municipality of Vaala the most in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, the councillor of the neighbouring municipality, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again put the Oulankaari writers on their feet.
The war writers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting for the vacant residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but they do not say what level of care it will provide or with what staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
The health centre’s facilities are being closed because there is no doctor’s night service.
Attendo will also turn to the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala’s example illustrates how centrist officials run delegates with incomplete information and how delegates are stabbed against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty the Vaala residents, because who will remain insecure there to live voluntarily if there is a possibility to move away.
Was there a single electoral slogan in the center that the whole country would be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people protested in Cologne when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the river Rhine since the morning.
You are not welcome, Erdogan read on the signs of the demonstrators, and slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan's visit on Thursday, several demonstrations have taken place and security measures have been tight.
Around 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in Cologne to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
There were also supporters of Erdogan in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During the visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Merkel and Erdogan pledged on Friday to rebuild relations that have deteriorated significantly since the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Cologne’s Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia’s Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony after criticism of Erdogan’s visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to Switzerland to protest against Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go out on the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of Erdogan’s trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
Three Slovakian journalists charged with murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
In February, Kuciak was found shot in his home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were linked to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and Kuciak’s article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of livestock on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing failure, the Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution of common boxes has to be done from memory.
It was the same with the Saturday newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting will put extra bouquets of newspapers in the province.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others, in his upcoming live talk show.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her upcoming space voyage, which she booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan to be paid.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year after year.
Now it seems that after the unlucky test flight that took place in 2014 and killed a few people, things are going well.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that her journey takes place about a year after the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and will be in weightless state for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut said on his website.
At the same address, he also hints at his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on TV.
Star Wars has been seen, and that's what left the idea.
Why not? Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued their defeatless first round in the Premier League after defeating Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the guarantors of the sixth victory of the reigning championship team.
Sterling managed to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute at the back of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his score to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton defense to pieces in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentinian was able to place the 2-0 finals at the penalty point easily.
With six wins and one draw, City leads the Premier League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played one less game, is only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea on Saturday night in their seventh round match.
Youth clubs choose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Societies elected new decision-makers for their next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
40 members and 40 deputy members of the council were elected, the Finnish Youth Club will announce on Sunday.
The youth conference was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operational goals, the Youth Society Conference in Joensuu makes three promises: We keep our doors open for everyone, and we organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteering and people on their own growth paths,” the Finnish Youth Society says in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and surprised Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu was asked if he believes that dismissing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn’t think that Raikkonen would put gloves on the counter.
I don’t think Kimi will change in the rest of the races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Raikkonen has been one of his front doors.
“I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed about Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day long.
"I've always been Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday in Russia.
Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes will start the race from the pole position at 2 pm.
It follows the race from moment to moment.
The A-Juniors Championship has become a farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The boys' top league ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the 1 p.m. round, the starting points for the championship competition were clear: FC Lahti Academy had enough of a first-class point against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to reverse in the last round, the second lynx in the championship fight must win the PK-35 and wish the Lahti players to be defeated.
The Lahti championship was practically confirmed even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Lahti led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played with the same players in the A-juvenile SM-series, i.e. the P20-series and the men’s Kakkonen C-series.
Vasa IFK has been playing in Kõkkonen practically against the fall of the whole season.
In the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFua in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - Rescue Department said luck was involved
A passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof at Eno Juttuvaarantie on Sunday around 9 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were injured, the rescue department said.
Good luck, the statement said.
Rescue said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol came to the accident.
Supo expects new means of intelligence: equipment purchases and recruitments have already been made, there is no slouching about operations planned abroad
According to Supo’s chief Antti Pelttar, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
When the intelligence laws enter into force, the budget of the suppo would be increased permanently by about EUR 10 million.
The offices of the Finnish Protection Police (Supon) in Ratakadu, Helsinki, are already fully preparing for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of Supo’s coalition, tells Lännen Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams sings in topless for breast cancer awareness campaign
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings only with her hands in front of her breasts, AFP news agency said.
The song is a 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voiced a global hit of The Divinyls to remind women to regularly do self-checks," Williams wrote on Instagram.
And yes, this put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it scares many lives.
The song was co-written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the comments on the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams retired from the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
This is the result of the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired on the referee, arguing, among other things, that men were accepted far more harsh behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on a mountain trail is not suitable for height-scared people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang Province, China.
It is literally located on a cliff.
You can watch the forest spreading down there if you want.
The rugged scenery in the heights makes restaurant visitors breathe in the Longquan Mountains.
Access to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place tells us.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Today is the end of the race: This is how it all ends
All good things end in time.
Today, this is what happens to the Finnish rural drama Korpela alley running, which has been quite enjoyed.
The third season has gone on like hot rocks: last week, the episode was premiered on TV by 722 000 Finns.
The peak figures are no longer of any practical significance, as there will be no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final season, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku takes another huge leap forward, and I think Jaska’s mother is the first to guess what’s coming.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, even romantic in light of recent events, but then Laiho appears again.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
However, no one can predict the fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, receives some incredible news.
The last will of the distance is revealed, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
In a week’s time, Sunday evenings will continue with the latest episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 21.05.
Is it better to go to work tomorrow with a cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people want to stay home or not.
Workers should, however, consider whether it is worthwhile to go and infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of a cold suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in crawls.
With the latter option, you may already be infecting others, even if your symptoms seem small, according to Prevention.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted a day before the symptoms begin and from 5 days to a week.
Children can infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough goes away and there is no fever, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Getting back to the gym too fast will slow your recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, sniff in a handkerchief, and throw away the rag papers.
Sorely moving though?
If you have to leave your home ill, consider wearing a mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
“You don’t put your fingers in your nose or mouth,” Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How can we avoid infection?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
Ice hockey players and misses are often associated with each other.
This was the case with Alina Voronkova, 23 years old.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has won the Miss Finland 2018 crown for her curlers.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina’s mother is an Ingrian Finn and her father is a Russian.
His father was bullied at school.
Mom and Dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
I had no friends at all in Pertunmaa," Alina says at the announcement of the Miss Finland semi-finalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start from scratch and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the missibeauty made new friends and the everyday life started to roll as desired.
At the age of fifteen, you think you're an adult, but afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans.
After the SM-liiga career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he played for the Finnish team in the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of the relationship, the couple lived in a distant relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I could make it to the winning trio and have a career with it, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good confidence and the good thing about remote relationships is that the initial spark stays on all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing in Continuous Growth, Death Behind Us
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s resilience.
Yet there is hardly anything we want to give up.
We are looking for sustainable alternatives to continuous growth, but the theory of moderation runs into major problems.
For a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that they could only dream of.
However, the long-standing overcapacity of the world and climate change are causing this market economy to be threatened with destabilisation.
Two men were stabbed at Sitratori in Kannelmäki at 4 a.m. on Sunday night.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in a stab, while another, born in 1968, was milder.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible role in the stab is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect in the incident.
The incidents are investigated as an attempted murder and assault.
IFK Mariehamn: Inter coach regrets mistake
IFK Mariehamn’s Simon Silverholt’s handicap against Inter brought the team an important point in the men’s football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the game in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt passed through the right side and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
During the draw, the Maarianhamins reached two points for the Turku Ball Club.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn’s head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said the team didn’t get into the fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but luckily the goal of Turku brought us stronger into the game.
Inter head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but the goal was again painful.
"One defensive mistake took us the full pot of points," Allen said.
We were the best again!

Lehtelä showed his underpowered skills, the place to play is not yet sure
Jori Lehterä’s strong underdog play came to the fore when his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last training match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia defeated Boston 4-1, and Lehterä passed Michael Rafflin twice to the goal.
In the past few days, the newspaper has been on display due to suspicions of drug use.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug chain where some are suspected of drug use and some of sales, for example.
Lehtera has denied having committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, an editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely follows the Flyers, estimates that Lehterä belongs to a group of six strikers, five of whom will get a seat in the NHL team.
During the training match Lehterä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the disc under himself, pulled the defender on him and baited Rafflin to the open space waiting in front of the goal.
For the second time, the two teams scored a goal at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a away match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakaaninen is waiting for a decision from the team’s coaching team to see if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best and I can be proud of it.
The coach decides if I can play.
"I think I'm ready for the NHL," Liikanainen said in an interview on Boston's Twitter account.
Liikanainen, who learned her hockey lesson in the Jokipojs, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
In the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and declined 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit by overwhelming the team when they overthrew Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary, Ilves was raised by defender Juuso Välimäki, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested among others Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played for over 20 minutes and scored a goal against Tampa Bay in a local game.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus' defender Markus Nutivaara fed his team in the mid-final of the consolation goal when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
Joonas Korpisalo scored 23/27 against the losers.
Already over 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a survey on the decision on the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered over 180,000 answers.
The questionnaire opened in the Otakantaa.fi service can be answered in less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time period as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic States, Central Europe or Western Russia.
World's Strongest Man Lost Dozens of Pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world’s strongest man, is undergoing a striking transformation.
The British man Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the world's strongest man for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat as much as 10,000 calories a day and weighed at least 200 kilos, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to harming his body.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British wanted to win the World's Strongest Man race, and the man promised to end his career if he was given the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man competition in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram in which she poses in a significantly slimmer condition than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he now trains five times a week in aerobics.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was Haf<0xC3><0xBE>ór Júlíus Björnsson from the Game of Thrones TV series.
The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on a cliff in Pyhäjärvi - "Strongly stuck on a rock"
The inland boat M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday evening at Akaa Pyhäjärvi.
The Rescue Department received an alert after a water traffic accident on Friday evening after 11:30 p.m.
The 30-metre-long ship M/S Tampere has been driven to the rocks, and it is firmly attached to its bow by a rock,” said Matti Willman, fire chief on duty.
The ship carried 19 passengers and five crew members.
Rescue officials said injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transported by bus to Tampere, the on-call chief Jari Nieminen told STT after one o’clock in the night.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship sailing from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
Fire Chief Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and fairly strong winds.
Rescue officials say the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship doesn't seem to bleed.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, the M/S Tampere is nowadays an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant vessel with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Heleni
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Itta-Sanomat today reported on the application for a challenge filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LLJ Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged unpaid manager fees in excess of EUR 80,000 together with interest on late payments.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkkila worked for Helenius on April 15, 2014-30, 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkkila says to Ilta-Sanomi.
Helenius’ current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to Iltalehti telling the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the sum claimed.
According to his answer, Kokkkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsoring income for him.
It was literally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they had arranged.
This is also the normal and sole practice in the management of professional athletes.
Paid work has never been agreed upon, and it would have been absurd in Helenius’s situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement.
According to her answer, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal to be poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was given an "unidentifiable but large" bill from the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been made.
Helenius considers the aftermath of Helminen and Kokkkila to be cowardly, the reply states.
Helenius today faces Erkan Teperin, who is seventh in the IBF heavyweight challenger list, in Stuttgart.
A hearty man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of his death was published Sunday in Helsingin Sanomat.
According to the report, Pällin died on September 3.
Pälli reported on a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He said farewell to Facebook earlier, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio sees Erkki Päll as a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a well-liked person who had quick wits and funny things.
I got to know Erk already as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started working as a warehouseman there.
We met with Erik.
He was a Finnlevy spokesman and held various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went on to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable, and I could see how much he was burning with entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a good man and a good reporter.
For many, he became known as a respected Yle radio presenter, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper stories.
Erik interviewed me many times.
He was very good at talking, he praised.
Over the decades, Pälli worked as a journalist with Toivo Kärje at Fazer Records.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's albums.
Päll's greatest passion, however, was radio work, where he had a distinctive style.
He began radio work in the 1960s and became known to numerous listeners in Yle ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately 450 000 euros.
The alliance describes its economic situation as having experienced a "full turnaround", although the economy is, of course, burdened with "significant debt on the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid reaction and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has been instilled throughout our organisation,” Kulmala said in a statement.
We have also been successful in partner acquisition, and in addition, the profitability of the world cups was maximum in the past competition period.
However, even in the future, the management of costs must be rigorous, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital Please in the city of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and the need for care.
Patients are also treated outside due to aftershocks.
One of the residents in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Palli Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the military hospital in Palu was Dwi Haris, who was injured in the back and arm.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake started.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I must have been squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
"I hope they are safe," Haris told AP, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed.
At the evacuation centre, 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma tried to calm her febrile baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many Please residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somehow upright, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury its inhabitants underneath it.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in the prison escaped after the walls of the prison collapsed.
The number of prisoners is estimated to be about 560, so there are probably about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, according to The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were furious and set fire to the prison after guards told them not to go looking for their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
One of the first aircraft to land was an army C-130, which brought aid supplies.
Commercial flights Please enter the airport only to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land on the ground without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rainfall area from the west will spread across the whole country on Sunday night, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain mostly comes in the form of water, but in Central and Northern Lapland it is expected to rain or snow.
The severe frosts of the previous night will not be repeated, because under the cloud cover the temperatures will remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures under control.
Just in the west you can visit the frost side for a moment, said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainfall retreats eastwards during the morning.
In the south and west, it is cloudy or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, the temperatures move all the way up to the height of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week will look similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
In maritime areas, wind and wave warnings apply.
There will be no autumn storms in the coming days, but otherwise the weather will be variable in the typical autumn.
It's going to be a very serious autumn, Ilkka said.
The "Miss Finland" final will not be seen on TV
On IL-TV you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti’s entertainment journalists are broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland finals in Billnäs.
The broadcast starts around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned among the ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnäs Ironworks in Raasepori.
Before the final starts, you will be able to follow the atmosphere on-site on IL-TV’s live broadcast.
The live broadcast starts around 18.30 and continues for about an hour.
This year, many Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
They will be represented in the jury by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Ziprus.
Other members of the jury are wellbeing entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kauppa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Lintunen from Seiska.
We were hoping he'd get into college before he went to the Mississippi.
A Russian father, Dimitri, and an Ingrian mother, Svetlana, believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland finals.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, the parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, proudly followed the first moments of her daughter’s crown.
They reached the audience from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival I got nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that when she was a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than being a Miss.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina became excited about beauty contests.
Her parents wished that Alina would be admitted to university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and in the end Alina still wanted to do a bachelor’s degree before the Mississippi Games.
We asked him last year why he didn’t take part, but he wanted to finish the bachelor’s degree.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for both young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, you can see it.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri works in Japan and couldn’t get to Finland to encourage her lover in the finals.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for a missy year.
Yes, that is the intention!
Her parents hoped that she would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long pause in visits now because of the missikry.
I miss you, even though you've been sent messages.
Young man killed in overrun in Lahti, police arrested three people
Police say three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
The Häme police did not comment on Saturday on the course of the events or the possible intentionality of the overdrive, citing the unfinishedness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the suspects and the man killed in the crash knew each other beforehand.
More information on the case will be available at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a cartoon came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Organic stuff started with my husband’s quote, in which he suggested it for a story I had developed as a person, says Sari Piippo, a comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator in Brussels dealing with economic and legal matters until after having a fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I enjoyed being a housewife very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought about what I would do when I was growing up, when even the smallest child was already growing up.
Then, in 2014, a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
The last time I drew was as a child, but when these manuscripts of Organic Homing began to come into being, things changed.
At first, I wrote dozens of manuscripts in the desk.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I couldn't get her to join me until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying, Piippo laughs, who tells me that the print was a great stimulus for him.
A board is an easy and handy tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, Piippo tells me about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop up in my mind all the time, but I don't usually make them all at once.
One three-square strip takes up to several hours.
I might make one screen at a time and like to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest part, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the contemporary comics in newspapers, including Scott Adams’ Dilbert.
The characters of the organic cabin are a mother with a pork-canary and a lettuce hair.
The other characters are Man, Piss and Twins.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a forceball even though the Organic Homp is sometimes intruding on the matter.
Piippo says she is reading her series with her husband and children.
It is such a great feeling to look at the comics he has drawn and to see that this is what I have done today.
There are plenty of challenges for the housewife.
The series can be read online at organichomppa.cartoonblogs.com
The lottery’s million-dollar jackpot was swelled – these were the correct numbers
There were no full hits in the lottery round 39/2018.
The biggest wins of the evening were seen at the Saturday Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, the lottery will have <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 million in the pot.
There were two 6-correct results on Saturday-Joker.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 prize goes to Vantaa for the winner who played with a Veikkaus card in S-Market Tikkurila.
The other was caught by an online player.
Indonesia Earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn't leave cracking tower until he secured hundreds of passengers
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old air traffic controller, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely from an earthquake-stricken island.
The young man was in the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Please after the earthquake hit Friday.
While the others were fleeing the control tower, Agung refused to leave until he could steer the Batik Air airliner off the runway.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower shook and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The quake intensified after the flight took off and was finally measured at a magnitude of 7.5.
At least 832 people died.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has honored Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn: "We need to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the US and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
President and CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first meeting that while the tightening tension will not have a direct impact on Europe’s trade flows, it will weaken confidence, which in turn will be reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
This also applies to the exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn thinks that Europe is a very good resource for the time being.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be getting overwhelmed by a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the entire Western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday to a clear deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year’s deficit will be over 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s loan portfolio consists of problem loans and more than ten per cent of non-performing loans.
In addition, its public finances are on a weak footing and it appears that the country is once again exceeding its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when asked whether Italy was taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
The second issue that affects Europe is the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
A disputed separation would have far more negative effects.
Rehn became the Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Mario Draghi will resign in a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have been mentioned in the speeches.
It probably doesn’t matter if Finnish names are involved,” Rehn said, adding that he will not comment on the matter further.
HS’s super-popular Black Box shows will resume next week – the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.

23 October The Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
The show in Tampere is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage will tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not been published in any HS medium before.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe, and an addressing story about a very current health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the stand.
The Black Box was awarded as the journalist of the year at the Bonnier Gala.
The awardees praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to get close to their readers.
The 2019 Black Box will be shown at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The content of the presentation will be different from that of the evenings this autumn.
Lost fungus found thanks to "unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police’s drone expertise is the world’s top: “We are asked about training”
According to the rector of the Police College, in addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use the drone in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions, for example.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find the missing mushroom killer in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Rector of the Police College Kimmo Himberg tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that “through unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are at the top of the world here too”.
The drone is quite new and even newer in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are masters in the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This is evident, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone operations of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
More and more common
Himberg reminds us that it is very important to find a missing person in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible.
In the case of Raahe, the missing person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are being trained.
Drones are already widely used in police operations, and their use will increase and increase in the future.
That's what I dare say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police may also use drones to investigate accidents or crime scenes, for example, and to carry out certain types of intelligence.
For example, there is already a need to check a region a little further, where there may be fear of violence.
In this case, the drone can be used for pre-enquiry.
Karelian Rugby in the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated 2nd division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
Joensuu was still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and porched the southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd division championship marked a historic rise to the 1st division for Karelian Rugby.
Previously, the club had played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM-series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club is going to take the league seat, but it will have a lot of work to do next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer distances to play, so the fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, confirmed on their Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a super pledge for Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in the summer draft.
The assailant joined Montreal’s training force in late summer and has played strong points in the training matches in September.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big development steps after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night.
Montreal faces the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, Nokia’s Chairman of the Board Risto Siilasmaa told about his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also talked about the managers’ inability to act as a team; fear and non-speechability, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company’s risk-taking and agility in the upswing phase disappeared.
In Helsinki, a business event called Nordic Business Forum was also held during the week, which attracted the cream of the Finnish business community to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world came on stage.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
The legend Gary Hamel once said, “A good manager must have the courage to take a company to the future even when the company is doing well.”
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods chain, said that the manager must be able to communicate the company’s purpose to all employees.
And that can’t just be a win-win for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the book on introverts, said that the most successful managers are researched to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, said that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of a company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A company that has grown to maturity needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum – mostly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A good leader requires a lot.
This is why management so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in a friendly manner.
However, they doubted whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrives on a red carpet from Los Angeles, spending most of the year abroad
Model Sara Chafak came to the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a lace outfit.
A little bit of Jet Lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there,” Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to audition in L.A.
He has, among other things, made advertisements.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, the work needs to be done even harder, because there is always an easy replacement for the work of a model.
“You have to push harder and be aggressive,” Chafak says.

Danish police find Volvo searched: 'We can't tell you where'
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the <0xC3><0x96>resund and the Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själln were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police searched for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
Is reached out to the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car we were looking for has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet," Henrik Storm told Ilta-Sanomi.
Storm said the black Volvo he was looking for had no direct connection to the threat.
He said the greatest danger was over.
Ekstra Bladet, Denmark, told the police on Saturday.
Investigator J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn’t want to say what kind of crime was being investigated.
Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched during the operation.
The police do not say if they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The police in Copenhagen also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat targeted certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of dissension – now the people vote on it in controversial elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Greek and Macedonian governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
So far, Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s aspirations to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
Voting began slowly, at least at the school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This is a change, especially for young people, he said.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) became independent in 1991.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough excitement as to whether the turnout will exceed the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but winning a 'yes' vote would give a mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations will close at 8 p.m.
Nice win!
Robert Helenius knocked Erka Teper out
Robert Helenius met Erka Teper in a heavyweight boxing match in Germany late Saturday night.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner may have the opportunity to compete in tougher positions than those seen on Saturday, which are of considerable financial significance.
Helenius decided the game in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper out with a hard left hand punch.
Teper could no longer get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German began to bleed from his nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to be fighting back in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it was revealed that the German had been burned twice in a doping test.
Helenius has claimed the title of his professional career in 28 matches and has suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton wins by 50 points to Vettel
The Formula One championship approached once again as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton defeated Russia's GP and stretched his world championship lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position in the race, ran second.
Bottas, who won his career in Sochi last year, held a top spot in the mid-terms of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
From the last row, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was fifth.
A duo assaulted a youth man in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Yugoslavian at Siltakatu 12 in Joensuu on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also stole the victim’s phone.
Police caught up with the suspects, a 35-year-old man with haywater and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered contusions that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk will resign as Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is struggling against time to make peace with the U.S.
Time is running out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators have been in close dialogue throughout the weekend.
Canada’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, has postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade talks.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began talks about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement with Canada has yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico want the agreement to come into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign the agreement at the end of November – whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday, so that the US Congress has enough time to evaluate it.
A neighbor thought the candles were lit in a fire in Kaakkuri - the fire department was alerted
The candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, triggered a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were called to the scene due to a possible fire in a block of flats.
On the spot, it was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment apartment looked like a fire in the opposite house, which is why the emergency services had been notified.
There was no fire at the site.
Police arrest 11 people after Honka-HJK match - clashes on the field and at the subway station
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the men’s football league Honka-HJK match in Espoo, police inspector Teemu Värtinen of the Länsi-Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection from crime and disturbance.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Earlier in the evening, I heard the words.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the field from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between the supporters of the teams.
In order to end the situation, cavalry police were needed.
In addition to the field, the clashes took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen pointed to a riot in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal charges have been filed as a result of the incidents.
Tahtakivi skipped butterfly swimming in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tahkukivi have advanced to the finals on the closing day of the 3/7 World Swimming Cup competitions in the Netherlands.
The games are played in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS Tahtekivi broke Finland's record in 50 metres butterfly, where he finished second in the first round in 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tahtokivi swims in Helsinki during the SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen from Espoo’s Cetus was 24th in 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen finished the first half of the 50 m breaststroke in time 30.48 and reached the final.
Laukkanen scored 15th in the first round of two hundred metres mixed swimming in time 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - the simplistic Oresteia affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the last time the National Theatre saw an ancient tragedy, Sofocle’s Philoctetes, was in 1988.
Now, the Academy of Theatre brought the only intact play trilogy of ancient times, the Oresteia of Aishylos, on a tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat Open! projects, which started in 2015, the actor students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia was held in Berlin in April.
The Atonement of Roiha from Oresta summarizes the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the establishment of the rule of law to a meritorious twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuren’s fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the revealing sides of the theatre space emphasize simplified and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the performers, who alternately separate from the choir, performing title roles, and the choir.
Both double and triple interpretations of title roles are used in the performance.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returned from the Trojan War, and his prey, Cassandra, are shown on the stage, contrary to what was customary in ancient performance tradition.
The show does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient show tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation is created in front of the viewer, faithful to the text, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of actress students from the master’s stage, performing as a close group, even as a single organism.
Especially in choir sections, the actors who lean to very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights barely, only by decorating the white curtain, on the stage.
That's impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer produces its first hydrogen truck
This innovation is starting to show in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the IAA commercial vehicle exhibition in Hannover, Hyundai will supply a new model of 1,000 cars to the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell truck, Hyundai continues to build hydrogen cars on the road marked by Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refueling network,” said In Cheol Lee, Vice President, Hyundai Motor.
Fists fluttered several times in Kajaani
A little over 30-year-old man assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, the assailant also hit him.
Police arrested the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another policeman in the foot.
He also threatened police with assault and murder.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is investigated in three cases of assault and violent opposition to the official.
There was another assault incident in the centre of Kajaani on Mid-Atlantic Street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old man from Kajaani hit the victim.
Shortly afterwards, another man knocked him down and the man who had hit him before kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim and police were called.
The perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask eyewitnesses to contact the police of Kajaani by phone at 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at research.kainuu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long-line radio presenter Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, a long-time journalist of Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio presenter Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, we're on our way.
The doctor said, "I live one day at a time," he commented on his situation in Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of store aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I was first hired for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you are surprised by a topic on these rings of the year, it is usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, an expert on the working environment of the Service Trade Union (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, say otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly perceived to be serious and many real cases of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies are obliged to report their near misses on the basis of the OSH Act, but these statistics will remain for internal use and their data will not be collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always result in physical injuries.
However, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no intervention.
Too many people are scared at work, even though the actual action does not take place.
Some areas are restless.
The store's got security guards.
When the opening hours of the stores became vacant, there was also a considerable media outcry about the impact on sellers’ safety.
"At that time, quite a number of employers arranged security services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but it is generating a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained well under control due to security, the impression was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, people are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make an inquiry into a criminal who usually lives in the vicinity of a trade.
But according to the same subsection of the Act of 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is beaten, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court puts a few assailants in jail, and sentences come from the hard end of the scale of punishment, customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open almost day and night, even in small towns, must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg remarked to Miss before the live broadcast: "Sara, Iiro is married then"
This year, Miss’s coronation will not be seen on TV in the traditional way, but will be broadcast on the Viafree website.
The show will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host of Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and media representatives about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give a cheering applause to Harjula.
Now, all the ladies scream!
Now look at our male presenter, Sohlberg cheered his colleagues as the audience cheered.
The first races will be followed by many of the Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iro is married!
Sohlberg looked at Sarai.
Sohlberg probably referred to the recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although at first he seemed confused.
Sieppi spoke about her divorce for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomat weekend newspaper.
Missikavuotar said she did not want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in public, as it is between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry to get into a new relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I’m focusing on my own stuff and especially I’m starting to live my life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula’s marital status came up even later, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The hosts laughed at me.
He was married, wasn't he?
Janni Hussi made a mess.
The Pohjan man tortured his tied unmarried partner by slitting, burning and feeding strong sauce
A 34-year-old man living in Kokkola has been sentenced by the Ostrobothnia District Court to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his unmarried partner.
The instrument of the crime included a belt, cable, and bundles.
The court forfeited these items to the state.
Rankin was charged with a suspected rape.
However, this allegation was dismissed by the court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threats, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of damage were attributed to Kokkola.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the incident, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
Last Thursday, the Ostrobothnia District Court handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to be held in Vaasa Prison.
There is no evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two serious deprivation of liberty and a serious rape on May 22.
However, these allegations were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was handled behind closed doors in court.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had committed violence, threats and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to confiscate its criminal instruments: a belt and cable, ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a blade.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to co-exist between the acts.
You can read from the verdict that most of the aggravated acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
There were four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm in the total amount of 5,800 euros.
He has hardly any money, as the sentenced person has long been in debt.
Prison is not a man's first.
It does not mention the name of the victim in order to protect the victim’s privacy.
The recent judgment is not legally binding at the time of writing this.
Europe leads four-point to Ryder Cup solution
European golfers imprisoned their leaders in a traditional hole game against the United States on Saturday.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup in Paris with 10-6 points, with 12 matches to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four four four four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon’s four-ball match the wins were tied 2-2.
The European stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches on Friday and Saturday.
No other European couple has ever done this before.
On Sunday, the duo will be looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in one Ryder Cup, and only three Americans have ever won: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the harsh harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football league team HJK issued a statement on Sunday condemning the disturbing behaviour of its supporters in a Saturday match at FC Honka in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 supporters of HJK rushed to the field and some seemed to try to challenge the supporters of Honga.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The police officers did not calm the situation, but policemen and also cavalry police were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team’s players and officers were shocked by what had happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old club.
"We strongly reject any action that would endanger the safety of the game," the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organizers in identifying threats to security and in eliminating milder phenomena.
Supporting culture is a part of football and is important to HJK.
We support positive, cheerful and supportive activities in football clubs in every way.
“Violence is not involved,” the statement said.
Philippine Inventor Flys Drone Car to Avoid Traffic Congestion
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Clown Fearless.
He is now part of a growing group of people around the world who swear to have invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, he has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says that he made his first successful test flight - he flagged his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL forecasts: Workers’ struggles starting tomorrow will be visible in children’s daycare and social and health services
The prohibitions on overtime and shifts in the public and welfare sectors starting tomorrow are particularly visible in social and health services and in day care for children, says JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide-ranging and will surely be reflected in the lack of sufficient staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to get their kids.
It is now the job of the employer to ensure that the services are at play and that no one’s life is at risk,” Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shifting due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for staff not to be hired, but for workers to be left on overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet a labour action.
From an occupational safety and health point of view, it is quite normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only make them.
JHL opposes the government’s intentions to ease the protection against redundancy for small companies.
Labour market manager for municipal employers, Markku Jalonen, will not begin to anticipate the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, the social and health sector and the technical sector, it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience of similar activities of the Association of Nurses Super and the Trade Union of Social and Health Care, Tehy, for example, which lasted three days.
Their impact was quite small.
JHL’s prohibition on overtime and shifting applies to employees in municipalities, church, state and private social and health care sectors, among other things.
For example, childminders are excluded.
At this stage, nearly 100,000 JHL members are involved in the labour battle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other labour-related measures if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that this is running against the wall and hard.
He believes that both the U.S. government and the U.S. government must respond.
What’s special about this is that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance hasn’t been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the gestures of the ray and seahorse are studied in the fitness circles of the performance
In other premises, the Great Coral Reef was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time at Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer limited presentation will also be built, which will refresh and summarize the observations made during the initial exercises.
The theatre play is full of fairy tale magic for children.
The child’s perspective is already included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance that adults and children collaborate on.
It provides adults with information and observations about children’s ways of receiving information and making art.
The children’s ability to throw themselves into exercises and play together also slips the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat like a fairy tale ballet, a fitness circle, and a nature-themed information show, but it is finally tuned in different, non-human conditions around the visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with learning about the movements of corals and coral reef organisms and fish.
The gestures of rays and seahorses are taught in six different fitness districts.
Finally, a less than an hour long presentation will be made where music, lights, shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both dive people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
Views and observations in many directions make the performance dense and full of life.
Whether it's the landscape of an organism, the organism that looks at the landscape, or another organism or landscape that looks at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, this does not seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group aims to reach the boundary between thinking and action, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
Destructions beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to grasp the significance of exercising one’s own compassion in the face of destruction.
In other spaces, he has built his works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, whose wondering and play it opens up.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Children and young people are becoming more and more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking more and more at a younger age.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of intoxication and sex because others say they do too.
I was stunned when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth grade sister from a "boyfriend" on the weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn’t imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that we shouldn’t touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children are able to live a decent childhood and do not have to grow up too early due to group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram with makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos at night.
It’s hard to guess how old girls are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I’m glad I didn’t have a smartphone in my childhood.
I was able to be a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what others would think of me.
Yle: Authorities have told the heads of state that the Airiston Helmi incident is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Defence Police and the Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that Airisto’s Helme investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime.
The information of the anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police visited defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is first and foremost considered financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle’s information, there has been no evidence of a link between the seized material and national security so far, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way we can know yet what can be revealed from there, one of Yle’s interviewees says.
The extensive home searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely an economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled a story that discusses arguments both in favour and against.
Video: Dream Goal Saved Liverpool's Lost Series
Liverpool’s 100 percent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it was exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 visitor win.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal across the Premier League that City was serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be dominant on his own.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league cup away win on Wednesday from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but from there he bombarded the rear corner of the perfect left leg pull.
Pool's brass guard, Alisson, was a bit slow in his fight and only got his fingertips into the ball.
Klopp must have felt the defeat position slightly unfair, as almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah from the finish line.
In the second period, Chelsea vesper Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson reset Hazard's pass.
The best spot for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino.
However, the brass star’s butt was aimed at David Luiz, who saved the masters’ lead.
It didn’t last until the 89th minute when Daniel Sturridge was able to shoot freely from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to the top of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool’s 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it’s still at the top of the league – along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly in the championship with two points behind the top.
The clock shift conversations are deep
I remember a few decades ago when a magazine asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer remained the only one in my mind: the Nen-terminal.
Some have a n-ending in their last name and some don’t.
I mean, you can have dividing lines anywhere, and here's one bidder.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of annual clock changes.
A lot of people agree that changing clocks twice a year has been a job for fools and caused a lot of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time of day we will end up at: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows people to express their opinion on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is heavily held at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a word to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people’s well-being, and those who defend summer time with the effect of evening light on people’s outdoor desire and thereby well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that morning light rhythms the day and gives revitalization.
On the other hand, if you don’t particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, light will increase people’s outdoor movements and give better opportunities for autumn garden work, for example.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated to its hour.
I would like to take both, but badly for our location in the north of the globe, we can do nothing.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many people.
Typical of a discussion on the subject is that one’s own view is driven and another’s view is strongly opposed.
The arguments of the opponent are hardly heard, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is rather pointless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The topic is very easy to debate, because it does not require much effort and a mutu-feeling is enough to justify it.
Similar issues are usually disputed more heavily and equally fruitlessly.
I’m sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we can adapt to it.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels awkward.
Josba fought for a short-range victory
Josba's first away game at the Divar in the saloon band was a total of three points against Nurmo Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still in the lead at the beginning of the third round, but Josba was looking for compositions and recycling men in chains.
At 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 win goal.
Both teams played decisive minutes on equal footing.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fiery anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) also played in the second row at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
The next meeting will be in O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
Sunday's 200th Anniversary Celebration in Uncle's Church
The 200th Anniversary of the Uncle’s Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a partly sad atmosphere.
The arson of the church a week ago was a shock.
The church was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Even though no one would like to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in Joensuu parish association.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipalities and other associations in the world.
The Family Mass starts at 10 o’clock today at Eno’s church.
After that, we move to the parish house at the Karelian banquet table.
There is a lot of stuff on the show all day, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be explored under the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has been a parishmaster for 37 years and has retired.
The celebration of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The church building, which was built in 1982 and which has already been decommissioned, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in the evasive rooms of the former municipal building, says Kappa’s Markku Koistinen.
The church was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman for <0x24>40 million in fraud charges
Tesla and Elon Musk have filed a lawsuit with the US Securities and Markets Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected Musk of treason, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
Musk will continue as Tesla’s CEO.
Musk will be forced to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk will also be subject to stricter controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and monitor Musk’s communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay <0x24>20 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla's shareholders," said Steven Peikin, CEO of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk said the company’s funding was secured.
The TV briefly raised Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about an arrangement with the company’s other management or potential donors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would sue Musk and the company.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from running listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge frightened investors, and Tesla’s share fell sharply.
More than 800 dead in Indonesia tsunami and earthquake
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency.
The number of deaths is expected to continue to increase as the damage is still being solved.
According to Vice President Yusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
The Friday earthquake sparked a tsunami that hit the town of Please on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning about the tsunami was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known dead are from Palu, at least for the time being.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Several people are already known to have died.
Demolition requests for help
The Indonesian army has been called in to help rescuers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the site today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue effort day and night.
One of the focus of the rescue work is a hotel in Palu, whose ruins are still believed to contain 50-60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Agency, said one person had been exhumed alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which was popular with business travellers.
We also heard people calling for help, he said.
According to Syaugi, the earthquake and tsunami area would urgently need heavy clearing equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one of the authors appealed to a Facebook group.
The phone numbers of politicians leaked into the hands of disturbers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
They were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of the ministers.
It was used in the British Conservative Party Congress.
For example, the Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several members received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the public had access to the politicians’ profiles that were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party’s annual meeting.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician’s e-mail address, which was readily available online.
The person logged in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Somebody managed to change Boris Johnson's profile photo for a moment to a porn photo and a title offensive.
Michael Goven's profile photo was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people’s profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made the phone number of every journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A conservative spokesman apologised for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the app is now running safely.
The ICO supports the data breach.
The application was created by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland has a large number of clapping Poles in the audience every week
Attentive viewers drew attention to the reaction of the studio audience on The Wall Suomi.
The U.S. format The Wall, which has spread rapidly around the world, landed on Nelos last Saturday as a Finnish version.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, was filmed in the same studio in Poland where other international productions of the format are made.
The shooting possibilities in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the large 12-meter-high playing wall of the format demanded space from the farm.
During the opening period, the program’s studio audience was highlighted on social media and it was assumed to be Polish.
There was a debate on Twitter about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game in Finnish.
Une Sormunen, the head of domestic programmes at Four, will illustrate the matter for Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes close friends of the players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland and Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes from other countries filmed in the same production room.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who attend the shoots of various programmes, Sormunen says.
He reminds us that it is not so difficult to follow the game in itself, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green spheres are easy to distinguish.
However, foreign-language interpreters are present in the studio to handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as simultaneous interpreting to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff recently dealt with domestic production.
A few years ago David Hasselhoff took part in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
He was constantly receiving simultaneous interpretation in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the shoots, Sormunen summarized.
Typhoon in southern Japan heads for main islands, warns of landslides and floods
The authorities also warned of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and there are no known casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and more than 300,000 households have been cut off from power.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and some high-speed trains have been halted due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka near half-day Finnish time.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo.
According to meteorologists, Trami will continue to torment Japan until Monday.
The ace sky went darker and darker
The start of the aces has been bad.
The sky was almost darkened when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport at home on Saturday.
They now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points in six rounds.
None of the defenders of the Aces or the players in the two lower chains have scored yet.
The pressure is also constantly increasing.
Against the sport, the audience was out of the hall as soon as half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We need to be worried because we played that badly.
Especially the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2, told Assi.
Of course, the sport tasted good.
The team had a game underneath Friday, so you would have thought it would be visible in the making.
Maybe it was, but the Aces didn't know how to take advantage of it.
Number of Bread Day Visitors Continues to Increase
Mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders at the audience of the event in the grand hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe there wouldn’t be so many people coming this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Traktori Nagynöny SM competitions were held at the same time as the Bread Day, so it is perhaps expected that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were blocked before ten, the sellers said the products were out of stock, news porridge sold more than 500 portions, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had risen.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon were especially suitable for families with children, which seemed to have attracted a record number of them.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Salesmen also turn to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvesting products had arrived to the bread keeper.
Mother Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the Bread Day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children’s bread competition was attended by 11 different types of bread.
The winner of the rye bread competition Marjatta Vepsäläinen spent the day at the martto’s pie shop.
7 x The most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the book without fatigue.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do Your Eyes A Favor
The importance of lighting increases the more years of age you have behind you.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face with age, as vision accuracy decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
With age, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the caring effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire already for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interiors can only be highlighted with the right lighting solutions.
The current owner can afford to choose.
The popularity of the Japanese style combines Scandinavianism and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colours, metallic tones or ice cream colours, has risen to a boom.
Authenticity fascinates you just as much as the rest of your home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Demonstrate your personality
On the other hand, home is now investing more than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, even bold luminaire for your own home that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
You don’t necessarily buy the latest trend lamp for your home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain kinds of timeless, jeweled and elegant classics survive year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are separated.
The Canadian striker played three League matches in orange black without power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with a one-year contract that included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL for Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in the KRS Heilongjiang.
We still don't know if O'Donnell's new company is there.
Player wants to set an example in recycling - goods leave the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed into paper
Nowadays, the specialty store of games, Pelmies, recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online stores are packed in packages from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We can use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in good condition to use it,” says Ville Puurula from Oulu’s Pelimies.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic should be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to switch to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause any extra trouble.
It’s not a big problem to start recycling.
It also generates economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pyhämies activities, as in addition to new products, the store’s core product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion-conscious person: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classical clothes work from season to season in a uniform.
With their versatility, they create the foundation for a good wardrobe, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics even at an affordable price.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knits.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knitted polo collars made of natural material can not have a mispurchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, blush jackets or jeans, and you can create a discreet outfit as well as a snotty style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The trendy look of autumn comes from golden brown and wide-length corduroy trousers, black polo knitwear and gray ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, the blue-green Scotch square skirt and the burgundy loafers form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy garments: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence agencies have a long history of sabotage.
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRGs specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppe: sabotage and intelligence group.
Agents of the KGB in the western part of the Soviet Union prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasily Mitrohin (1922-2004), an archiver who sneaked west of the KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers' uniforms and accessories for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid equipment packs containing mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
Back in 1998, a KGB cache was discovered in Switzerland, and an annihilation device exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the area last night.
Police arrested four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
He drove at half past four o’clock at the beginning of Kajaaniintie with two passengers.
The car slipped into a ditch at 4 a.m. and a 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, according to the police.
He did not suffer any serious injuries during the exit.
A 20-year-old man who drove a car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil into an alcohol meter.
The police suspect the male drivers of serious drunken driving and the driver of Polvijärvi, in addition, of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van at the crossroads of <0xC3><0x96>llöläntie and Hoikantie blew 0.52 per mil.
He's suspected of drunk driving.
The police are asking for observations on the stab wound at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was beaten in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The crime was recorded on CCTV.
The suspects, wearing dark pants and a brown or beige jacket, left immediately after being stabbed in a dark station wagon to Ratapihankatu towards the bus station.
One of the suspects left on a bicycle towards the city centre.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after being hit by a bus.
The accident happened after 4 a.m. on Raumantie near the meadow.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s probationary period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (Center) has been important to the team in starting, playing underpower and playing a defensive role on the fourth floor.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club leadership.
Filip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in underpowered gaming and in the defensive role of the fourth-stage.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold onto such an experienced player,” said HPK’s sports director Mika Toivola.
According to Toivola, Riska’s value increases when playing ice hockey league solution games.
Center forward Riska from Pietarsaari has played league hockey in the past in JYP, Luko and Sport.
On the other hand, Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after a probationary period.
Today on TV, a climber was left to die twice.
Eighteen years ago, Beck Weathers wrote a book.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
The movie was made on that basis.
Everest is now debuting on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm struck the climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri’s 2015 film is about a struggle for survival that has been handled in a grainy way.
Films and documentaries have been made about this tragedy before.
Real events are also going on in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who guided Weathers.
Weathers' life could have been saved by eye surgery before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and atmospheric pressure, he lost his sight, and the conquest of the summit had to be skipped.
Rob Hall went on his way and never came back.
However, the battle between life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and could not find his way back to the camp.
When they came to look for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they did not believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
Yet, miraculously, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The severely frozen Weathers was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left to his own fate.
It is clear that, contrary to expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old church of Eno.
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The celebration started at 10 a.m. at Eno Church Hill with a family mass, after which Karelian banquet tables have been served at Eno’s parish house.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the Family Mass.
Uncle Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire in the church of Hytelysvaara has touched many and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno parish.
The church of Eno is now the elder of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the church of Kihtelysvaara was destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a worship ceremony was held in Hytelysvaara, where the church destroyed by fire was silenced and commemorated.
Pictures and videos: Medican showed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm struck southwestern Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Photos taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows a river suddenly appearing between the houses in the city of Kiato, in the Corinthian region, as a result of flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been driven by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese, strong winds caused strong seas.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens is advising people on its Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges you to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicain, brings with it heavy rains and even the risk of flooding.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medics appear only once or twice a year around the world, typically between September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey northwards and towards Europe.
In Greece, refugee camps on islands, such as Lesbos, have also been a source of concern.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to decent shelter.
The storm also hits areas destroyed by fires in the summer around Athens.
In Greece, there was also a medical epidemic last November.
Thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk during a storm.
The guides have given these instructions to more than 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece via Aurinkomatkat during the weekend.
Even the horrific Zorbas storm is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can reach up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
The wretchedness of the weather is increased by heavy rains.
According to the tour operators, all travellers from Finland to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui who have given their phone numbers have been warned of strong winds by text message.
In the air still sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, communication specialist for Aurinkomatkat, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by early Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and boarded on normal schedules.
Of course, we monitor the situation all the time.
Security is ahead.
Antonia Schroderus, the media watchdog of Tui, says that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are in constant contact with our staff.
At least in Crete it was still calm, he told us about the early evening of Saturday.
There are currently over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had glittered in Rhodes and the temperature had fallen to 27 degrees Celsius, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorbas is expected to become the next Turkish inconvenience, albeit somewhat relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya with Tui, for example,” says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisen and Janni Huss wear identical evening dresses in the Missifinals – this is how they reacted to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived to the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says he got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me a gorgeous dress for this evening,” Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The duo also noticed the same outfits themselves and reacted to the situation laughing.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomi that he was in a hurry in preparation and had to get ready on the plane.
In the final, Hussi serves as a backstage and red carpet host and chats with the stars in the front row.
Huss had a recent move because he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress broke out, I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful,” Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathered the curious gaze of pensioners
The host and Miss Suomi 2016 Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi finals she had enough to do with the radio broadcasts and Love Island Suomi shootings.
There has been enough haste even to the point that Karvinen arrived to the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I did makeup and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing the dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he has pulled out his makeup among pensioners.
His preparations also drew the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people's eyes in the mirror.
Makeup was fun, at least for others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also described his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen says he went to see the singles on Friday.
It's somehow really raw.
These are the genuine feelings of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How do I wear overknee boots?
Three perfect examples
Classical clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in a way that is not a costume.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals can fit in.
A few years ago, the overknee boots that became the hit boots of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, boots that reach above the knees repeat elegantly from year to year and from season to season.
Appearing boots share the opinions of users, but the bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
In fact, overknee boots are suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's a tail, lace, tulle or jersey, the boots' simple leather or faux leather surface works.
Long boots look great in both party look and everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots are perfect for even gentle outfits.
They balance the femininity of the pink, flowery plum skirt and the tender, fluffy knit.
A fresh but autumn-elegant everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
This strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is made from a long velvet coat, over-knee boots, eye-catching earrings and a riveted bag.
While the over-the-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday outfits, along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy hat.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars will start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring traffic in the area will start with a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robotic cars cope with the current street grid.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real-world environment,” says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time ever, robotic cars are fully automated in the rest of the traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the assisted passenger.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several sensors and assessing whether the driveway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run three days a week throughout the autumn: on Tuesdays at 13-15.30, on Wednesdays at 10-15 and on Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Stops of robotic cars are identified by stop markings.
The safest way to get there is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
Mokoma bassist falls off stage in the middle of a gig and gets injured
Mokoma announces a surprising situation on their Facebook page during the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
Mokoma’s gig at Tampere’s Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
He broke his wrist.
The band announced this on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Yesterday, Santtu stumbled from the stage at Pakkahuone in the last song and broke her wrists.
We wish you a quick recovery from metal!
The rest of the tour will be arranged with a backup crew, reads the page.
Fans of the band are worried about the photo update, where the bassist is lying on the bed with a plaster in his hand.
I was very worried about this news, how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones will fortunately heal over time.
Good luck and a quick recovery for Santu and a happy continuation of the tour for the rest of the band plus a substitute!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave off the end of such a strong drama gig in the future? writes one fan.
Police oversaw hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supervision on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police officers told on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the permissible number of self-loading cartridges used in chicken birding were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, who did not have the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised hunting.
Police also blew 133 drivers, two of whom are suspected of drunken driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine proceeding, police times.
In conclusion, hunters are very compliant with the licensing of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised.
One hunter said, “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone has checked the permits.”
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting supervision in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, first nominates particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than are included in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
The Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, Ilkka Salmi, is also on the trip.
Talking about a quota increase
Finland has been accepting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but there has since been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the last time the project has fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit will be the first in this government term that the Minister of the Interior will make on-site to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (collectively) and Paula Risikko (collectively) took up their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10,000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to go crazy - we don't know if we're gonna cry or laugh anymore
On Saturday, Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill basically prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by the decrees of ministries as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities.
Therefore, in principle, everything else is prohibited, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill turns into a law, it will probably mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good manners.
As a matter of principle, the prohibition of all activities that are not specifically authorized by law or regulation is now being enacted.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation that approves it has been passed.
The government’s work in drafting legislation has generally been weak.
If we now take the path that basically everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the animal protection law requires an update.
But a bill in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'everything is forbidden that is not expressly permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully, there will be a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of autumn
The trendy outfit for this autumn comes in snake prints.
It looks especially good in the skirts.
Combine a snake-shaped skirt with more subtle tops such as a polo or a regular t-shirt to keep the outfit stylish.

Feel free to combine different colors with each other and play with the box pattern also on the different tops.
For example, the combination of square and ball pattern is beautiful.
Asymmetric hems are a glimpse of the lightness of summer that can be taken with you into autumn.
The asymmetric hem is feminine and playful at the same time and fits perfectly for everyday and festive occasions.
Alexia baby, 3 months, grinning sweetly in Jere's arms
In Karalahti’s family photo, the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia is in the center of attention.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito kindergarten established in Kerava.
Exercise entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family increase at the beginning of July.
The couple’s firstborn son, Jax, turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently hosted a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, where the whole Karalahti family was involved.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the atmosphere in Spain, posing for the whole Karalahti family.
The children, Jax and Alexia, are in their parents' arms.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly grumpy baby Alexia, resting in the arms of Jere.
Thank you for this.
Grateful for kindness, forgiveness, people’s generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti alongside the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, who became known from the fitness diaries programme, recently left for their daycare business and opened the Aito daycare centre in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, the company includes food specialist Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for the breeding side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the kindergarten.
Turkey urges mobile phones to be charged in case of storm
Zorba storm, which hit Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece.
A tropical storm is reported to be moving from south to north along the coast during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday called on citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm hits and ensure they have an internet connection, so people can get up-to-date status updates, the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi said.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to southern Greece’s Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow the weather reports and instructions from the local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted him, there was a lot of wind and rain.
The people were quite calm,” Laura Aaltonen, Communications Manager at Tui travel agency, told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also not received any messages from the Finns in distress.
Several ports in Greece were closed on Saturday, the local news agency Amna said.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair announced on Saturday that the weather is being actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summarizes the reason for Mercedes’ superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen admitted that his worst competitor, Mercedes, was too tough in the Russian GP qualifying.
There is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver said.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, they were fourth and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel Räikkönen was clearly left behind in Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had a hard time in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what was the reason for the sudden drop from Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are – that’s as simple as that.
If I knew why, I think we'd go at the same pace as they did.
But I don’t know more than anyone else.
This is all speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
We saw a rare delicacy in the timings for Räikkönen’s upcoming team Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikkönen in Ferrari, was seventh in the season, and Marcus Ericsson reached the final qualifying session.
Sweden’s 10th place is best in more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive at all, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for the future of Raikkonen?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning of the season, then the step forward has been a big one.
Next year will be a different story, so let's see.
Robert Helenius knocked Erka Teper out: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was more proactive in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the match with his hard sets, which found their way very well.
The Finn was also in much better physical condition than Teper.
The decision came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked Teper out with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the pro in front of the home audience didn’t even try to get up from the carpet.
When the victory was secured, Helenius breathed quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
He then switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helen was happy right after the match.
It was a big win for Helen.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup, Helenius said to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's come to mind.
This is not getting any younger,” Helenius, 34, admitted before meeting Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice-president calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
Vice President Yusuf Kalla said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped people, as well as the dead, in the worst-affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: please visit the port town and its neighbouring village of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered an army to carry out rescue and clearing operations.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as the power and telecommunications in the disaster area are cut off in many places.
The fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Suomi's hesitant response and long reflection caused laughter
Billnäsin Ruukki is currently electing a new Miss Finland.
A question was asked to each of the finalists.
The finalists asked about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused a sweet but benevolent laughter in the audience.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book the missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer a long time before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., said Anttikoski, thinking.
There was a laughing-out in the audience until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I have read is...
I read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is Economics for someone, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a shouting applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Previously, on a missi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 9 p.m., when last year’s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm resigns.
Sike's apple-pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples on your own, because the domestic apple is in the store at a shocking price.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you don’t want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you also invest in the pear in the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seeds.
Sliced.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar until foamy, then add the corn flour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the cornstarch and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and the apple slices over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let cool in the oven and then overturn on the serving tray.
Cut the cake thoroughly when cooled.
The cake is brittle in structure and easily crumbles because the dough contains almond and corn flour, which are gluten-free.
Ruka will host an international crime literary event in January
For the first time in January, Kuusamo Ruka will host an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir event’s programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers as well as jazz music.
The festival’s literary guests include Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish descriptive literature, and the Swedish duo Jerker Erik Eriksson and H<0xC3><0xA5>kan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to Swedish names, writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland will also be present at the event.
The Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and Kuusamo’s unique environment provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two kinds of “coolness” with slightly different features: the generally attractive coolness and the contradictory dissident-coolness.
Charmingly cool people, the researchers described, had many characteristics that were considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experience and little interested in outside reviews.
Both men had good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of a hardcore is not cool in the long run: a high teenage status does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
According to a study published in 2014 in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out good-looking people and sought the favor of others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they performed less well than their former less discernible peers.
Lock cars, brand bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool – or at least not a truly attractive companion.
In a study published in the August issue of Social Psychological and Personality Science, the vast majority of people were more willing to make friends with people wearing a regular shirt than with a branded shirt – despite the fact that most people chose a branded shirt when getting acquainted.
If you are on the Greek islands, beware!
There's a hurricane coming up - the weather warning is shouting red
During the weekend in southern Greece, as much water can rain as in Finland on average in six months.
Hurricane Zorbas hits Greece this weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the area.
The approaching storm is also reported on the Foreca weather service’s blog.
According to the report, the strongest thunderstorms in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
In comparison, the Kuisma storm that hit Finland in the beginning of the week blew roughly 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can be released in southern Greece.
This corresponds to about half of the annual rainfall in Finland.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland Ankku drooling by men?
Showing up on confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in Love Island Suomi, the beautiful Anku, drooled by several men, also appears as a crafting lady in strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make octopus from an old paper roll.
Anku also shows in her sympathetic style how you can craft a hedgehog from tights that grows the right spikes.
Now let’s make the Easter grass grow, but let’s do it in a surprising way, Anku hints and presents sawdust, tights and grass seeds, which he makes a hedgehog from.
You can watch the videos below or on Ankku's YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and squeezed adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas trembled a little more tens of minutes after his pole position at the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton behind and it was certainly an emotionally important criticism for the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the settlement round.
"It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit," Bottas explained.
I've only been to the pole once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good laps again.
It is not easy to pass on the Sochi track, so the start is especially important.
And of course Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he would win tomorrow or whether he would have to go ahead to win the world championship against Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is that I’m trying to win.
When you leave the pole, there can be no other goal, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we will fight for both championships.
Lewis’ management of Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference with me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, though, Bottas added.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas’ success, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff had a taste of what he had seen.
Lewis had the intention of defeating Valtteri, but he failed in the seventh turn.
Valtteri knows that he has to tear everything from himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff waxed.
When asked if the team would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff responded by evasively.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen wins the Finnish Rally Championship
The Rally Car Series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally in Turku and Salo, where Tuusulans Eerik and Henrik Peternen won SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee secured the best achievement of his career when he won the Finnish Championship in the SM4 class of two-wheeled cars.
Honda Civic competitor Kinnunen and cartographer Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race with moderation, because the starting points were clear: placing in the top group would guarantee the title of SM.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give a leveling when some of the additional lights failed in another special test.
I had to put a third blind spot on it.
In a situation like this, you're not supposed to be sloppy.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, was tracked, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops were in Syria fighting terrorism and that the war against terrorists was “almost over.”
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, the seven-year war does not seem to end.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting on Syria was scheduled for October, with French, Russian and Turkish presidents attending.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Judge Drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, have been screened in an exceptionally large number.
A full-fledged US Supreme Court Judge nomination drama caught at least 20 million people in front of their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump-appointed Kavanaugh and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee telling their story.
According to the preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six major channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the live stream, and CNN reported that it had set the record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN’s figure will rise to more than <0x24>10 million if you include those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital start-ups are the channels’ own, TV audience figures come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they will be awe-inspiring anyway.
Rarely reaches <0x24>20 million.
In the United States, over 20 million spectators usually only get access to sports matches, major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The U.S.’s most watched annual program, the American Football League’s Super Bowl Final, is a long way from here.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people, according to Nielsen, and more than 30 million people attended the inauguration.
Top-priority issue
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are life-long.
Trump was able to appoint a new judge after Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor.
The second place was opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but in many respects he was a so-called Libra, whose vote could determine the position of a nine-member court.
She was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, she voted to rule that same-sex couples were granted the right to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the conservative supremacy of the court for decades.
Children have the right to receive information from their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can view their children’s health records from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: the parents were not even able to view the health records or recipes of the infants.
A temporary correction was obtained in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, it has been promised to correct the practices, but it has taken an astonishing amount of time to do so.
The repair is now underway - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal basis should not have been more than a go-ahead.
Then, with the layman’s understanding, it is a matter of pressing a button: now that the wire is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her information to his or her parents - if he or she has a bank account or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is paid for, and the 10-year-old does not even get the bank codes.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of a fourth-grade elementary school student except by asking for them in printed form.
It is not so much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is of utmost importance for the child’s care that parents can be involved in it.
The right to privacy of teenagers must, of course, be respected.
Minors can also have family situations where not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to clear allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating the allegations of harassment by at least two women.
Earlier this week, one of the women was heard by the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not be made public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The arrested rabbler continued to buzz even in the chamber.
The police said they had "calmed down" the man in the police prison.
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The official reports an incident that began when a man in his mid-30s challenged a violent dispute in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the food business.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by throwing him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, the man also hit him.
The triple assault led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took him to the police station in Kajaani, the police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another policeman in the foot.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police said they had sent him to a police prison to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
Aid organizations prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia: “Clean water is the most urgent”
UNICEF and other international aid agencies are ready to help the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, head of information at UNICEF Finland.
Rescue work is being led by local authorities, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capabilities,” Haru says.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Sulawesi, please, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, Haru says.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - first of all, tents - and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most important.
First of all, people can most often be provided with water purification tablets, which Unicef also has in stock.
Water systems will be repaired as soon as possible, but in case of an emergency, water will be transported first, for example, by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase, emergency aid will be used for previously raised funds.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started raising funds to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends Tesla’s <0x24>20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of the rocket and electric car companies, has agreed to avoid fraud charges by an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits as chairman of Tesla’s electric car company and agrees to a <0x24>20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement with the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids allegations of fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with fraud over his tweets in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull Tesla out of the stock market, which prompted the company’s stock price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new "independent member" to its board and include two "independent executives" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk continues to be Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk’s <0x24>20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay <0x24>20 million to the financial regulator.
Tweets mislead investors
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire, the company would be bought off the stock market for <0x24>420.
Tesla’s stock price rose by more than 10 percent in a day after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s allegations had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his alleged funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other board of directors or the Board of Directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate fell 14 percent after the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The news is expected to confirm the company’s course again.
The Last Judgment Is Not a Reason
The bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands are not moving.
It's a technical problem.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral tower has stopped.
The wise men point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt would hear an exorcism and the organ would be on its own.
This is not the case, of course, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken down.
A repairman has visited it, but some part has broken down and a new part is waiting for it, Suntio Eveliina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned in the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
In fact, the account mentions that the final judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says church bells don't ring because of a fault.
