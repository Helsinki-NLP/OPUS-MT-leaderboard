9-Year-Old Boy Found in Tampere
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance report of a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and does not endanger his life or health.
The boy’s father told Sánomi about midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-show.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo tore the score to Messi again
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued to produce in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal king turned at least for a moment in the latter’s favor.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time scorers when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits from penalty shots and one from a game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal score to 80, after the Barcelona Messi, who had tied with him before Tuesday, had 77 goals.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled on the Italian league in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in Champions League Group D, it began vigorously with a 2-1 visitor victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Alvaro Morata of Juventus just ten minutes before the end.
City's assault was bored by the absence of the knee-strained Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who had been injured in the Premier League game this weekend, arrived on the pitch only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United also had a tough time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1–2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old frontman Luke Shaw's away match lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slip stroke hit the ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven’s home stadium for about a dozen minutes before the medical staff took him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break with extra time.
The PSV win was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
In the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain started Group A.
It was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who changed the Manchester United shirt to a PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the back corner by Johan Wiland, the goalkeeper of Malmö.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the season's bestsellers.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the small clubs in the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team, the Moscow CSKA, lost in a match against Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition Party Calls for Immediate Resignation – President Says Wrong Speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, has made the same speech in Zimbabwe's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants hastened to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech dealt with China's impact on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria to hold special summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
European Council President Donald Tusk will assess the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to more effectively register future members in Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, a matter for the interior ministers.
Teacher Says He Shot His Girlfriend On An Emergency Call
Shannon Lamb, a slightly colored university teacher, tells police that she shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the contact details of the deceased woman's close relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss’s body and a handwritten note on the side of the booklet: “I’m so sorry I wish I could undo this lovely Amy and she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me.”
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police were besieging the ring.
Authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive the day after the school shooting forced students and staff to hide behind locked doors.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but who may have had problems.
Students said they were waiting for her classes.
Gautier, Prentiss's place of death, police say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "mighty people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had said he was under a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University's hiring principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and an assistant professorship.
William LaForge, the university’s principal, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
These questions can no longer be answered by Lamb.
After Lamb fled the campus, police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents’ house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, said Methel Johnson, a Washington County coroner.
Lamb's car was still running in the courtyard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and educational sciences. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb graduated with a doctorate in education in spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were melting wax while she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house by the river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
She was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen reported that he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together for a few gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
According to Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, a dim bar near Gautier, he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performances for a small number of audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were joking and throwing babbles at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, led a first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday evening, a candlestick ceremony was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended Mass, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associate Press author Emily Wagster Cheating from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to police now saying that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that even though during the call Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby retailer says it’s giving today’s regular and seasonal workers the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with the applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although there are months to the holiday season, the shopping season for Christmas is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
Back to the Future premiere was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's seat was next to me," she said in the upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The movie starts and it comes to mind that I'm just a fake cry and a stretch of my hand from a date with a princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, along with director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was released 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “To me, it’s undoubtedly the greatest time travel film of all time.”
Back in Time will be available on DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN leader says Syria situation will not be resolved armedly
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict “will not be resolved by arms,” and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations with a view to finding a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the divisions between the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "have made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and unity they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 Support Polls That Prove Donald Trump Is Serious
Some people have tried to label him as a windshield.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to drag Donald Trump away from the top of the support polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In ten of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been in the lead with a two-digit figure, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of the nomination of a real estate king.
The election is only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead over rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got a single state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s persistence and have begun to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transient phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, support polls at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans were positive about the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans are in favour of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten respond negatively.
These figures are also true in the first primary election states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "enthusiasts" vs. 40% Trump).
Is it the most enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, a favorite of the ruling regime, became a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican voters at the national level think that the real estate king has the character that is appropriate for the president.
According to a poll by Quinnipiac last week, the number in the state of Iowa that hosts the first congress is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the character that is right for a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent of Americans think that their character is unfit to be president, and nearly six out of ten think that their character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to it.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, 4 out of 10 people thought Trump was the most likely option when asked who was most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Republican voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
In the last parliamentary term, at this time, four out of ten Republicans were in favour of Rick Perry being nominated, with only 28% in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans voted for another candidate, Trump would win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field has probably contributed to Trump’s leadership, as anti-Trump support is divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gains majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's on the line with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were to face each other, Ben Carson would defeat businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just a little more than half of Trump voters have decided who their votes will go to.
Of course, things can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that they will never change their minds.
46% said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “rapers” in his campaign opening speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s pompousness will push Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and harm rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new height.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll on Monday that they would rather choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “dissatisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Mr Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, meets David Cameron for the first time in Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and is likely to be closely monitored by both the media and Labour MPs.
Corbyn has called for "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn’s leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silently during the national anthem at the memorial service on Tuesday, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has sparked criticism among Conservative MPs and has appeared in several front page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "stands respectfully in silence" and that he "recognizes the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn’s shadow government, told BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he believed the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, initially with less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supporting him as the leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant said the differences in policy regarding the party’s position in the European Union and the government’s ceiling for subsidies have “accumulated” within the Labour Party since Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at a trade union meeting that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow government’s secretary for work and pensions, said the party was “very clear” that they were only opposed to the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "multiplied" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister’s Question Hours is too conflicting and that he will refrain from both witty wording and spiking, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government’s secretary for finance, Angela Eagle, will replace her in questioning hours when Corbyn is not taking part – for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this issue.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be broadcast on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important metric for assessing the leader's judgement, his administration of the House of Commons, and his position with other MPs, even though critics have criticised the Question Time as having become a mere mockery that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained to be photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their neighborhood and profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young graduates of the project.

The pound rises as wage growth in the UK accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the figures showed a rise in wage growth in the UK, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bidder SABMiller.
Between May and July, wages in the UK, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to <0x24>1,5505 and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed to 6229.21 at a 1.49% increase.
SABMiller was the most prominent share on the market and rose by 20 percent after AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would bring together the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose 0.9 percent after news from the rival luxury group Richmont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were better than expected, and in addition, they showed that sales in China – which is Burberry’s key market – had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised <0x24>2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The Packaging and Paper Group Mondi's shares were among the largest downwards in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced its six-month pre-tax revenue: an increase of 83 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages May Harm Expansion
Peter Cowgill, the head of JD Sports, says that raising the minimum wage for employees in the UK could mean “an increase in the purchasing power of potential consumers.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
Costs could be targeted at the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in southern and western Australia before Aldi’s <0x24>700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store in South and West Australia early next year, with up to 120 stores coming in. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food retailers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like Simmo's, a Dunsborough ice cream maker, offer tastings at IGA stores, while store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organizes its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and West Australia together account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash’s IGA store area, with higher profit margins than the Metcash Eastern State IGA network.
It is well known that shoppers in South and West Australia are secular, with IGA dealers holding a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 % in the South and 24 % in the West, compared to 14 % in the Eastern countries.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
In a weekly report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers could lose <0x24>360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose <0x24>250 million annually by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west next year, generating revenues of <0x24>500 and <0x24>600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash’s high-fixed cost base can cost Metcash about <0x24>13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash's food and food sales to decline by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “very possibly disappear in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board of directors had contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 % since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which delivers products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43 % since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the level of debt financing of its operations as sales and margins are under pressure.
The wholesaler, however, stands by and has invested more than <0x24>150 million annually in lowering the prices of hundreds of products each week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate stores by increasing the speed of growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased the appeal, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation chairman Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in the recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, who deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behavior,” said Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks", was unwittingly made public about a case in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a fierce qualifying match in Cincinnati, the Chief Referee was forced to separate twice Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after a cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a strong defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for a second place in a doubles match with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into the clash," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost to the US Open because of a cramp, but he is not the first player to break his bat when frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature until the age of 19, he works hard, he fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in good shape and he is a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged by his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra team's return to the regular team.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we’re trying to support him, we’re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it’s best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public reflecting on those consequences.
Immigration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, detaining those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of daming the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
People who fled the violence in their home countries have now set up their tents and set themselves indefinitely on the road between the control stations of two countries.
Frustration, however, increased.
As the police helicopter stood above them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” to return migrants from Hungary, as more and more migrants are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not harm civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on a division of responsibilities for 40,000 asylum seekers who have now occupied Italy and Greece, and spoke hopefully about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
The state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed roads to be closed and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence at the Serbian border is complete, the country will also erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, not refugees fleeing war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly contradicted by other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise attempts to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected military deployment next week, but Associated Press journalists at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said the authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already reached the country.
They got over the fence by damaging it, are now imprisoned by the police, and are being charged with offences defined in the new laws.
The authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings at the Serbian border after sending a thorn-covered train wagon to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to push in.
About 20 were allowed in, but thousands were left outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership of Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two-digit Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is clamping on her.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), and second-place Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the Democratic electorate.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided who to vote for.
Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice more than those of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity among several population groups has declined since last month’s CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader among women and moderates, but her leadership has shrunk.
His popularity among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s lead over the Democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and she is now on a level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly in the lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit figure among the liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
Approximately half of the country’s Democratic voters say they will be eager to support Clinton if she becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not support Clinton at the moment – only a quarter would eagerly support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, Republican leader Donald Trump says the same (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had appropriate experience (16 percent), followed by the most popular answers that it was the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she was the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
With the Vice President influencing a possible presidential nomination, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race already – even though a third disagree.
When asked by Democrats who they would choose as second party nominee, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will increase. If Biden joins, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if Biden declines, the number will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden is far away, but the share of those who consider him the most eligible has increased.
When asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, the Democratic voters, however, put their opinions ahead of voting.
Last month, too, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden outperforms the trio best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters generally also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically agree.
When you look at all of these things, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server while she is Secretary of State still raises questions, the majority of Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation and say it did not affect their general opinion of her.
But it’s different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The people were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say that their overall opinion of Clinton has not been affected by the e-mail polemic, although 36% say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton’s own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points from last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country also do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many people don’t have an opinion about him, just like they don’t have an opinion about Carson.
The margin of error in a survey of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Approaches Donald Trump in National Survey
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates gathered half of all votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% in the previous CBS poll, which was conducted prior to last month’s Fox News poll debate, to 27% in the poll published on Tuesday.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is overthrowing Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen the most: from last month's 10% to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third in 6%.
The margin of error in a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll, conducted in September, is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is 32 percent ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rise in popularity last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First Year Student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the death of a student at a fraternity chimpanzee ceremony in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng’s eyes were blindfolded and his back was loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly knocked to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but were accused of waiting for an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search the web for information on his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the Brotherhood, asking for his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the order ahead of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng was unable to recover, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a blunt object on the head, body, and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered from fraternal smacking, as a result of which at least one student has died every year since 1970," Doug Fierberg, Deng's family attorney, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County is in favour of the first five members being charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also prosecuted for violent tampering and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to hold only individuals accountable, but if there is an organization that officially or unofficially accepted the situation, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood disbanded its connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the upward market is going down, bond yields are going up, and the economy is going into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not help much in terms of timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first lift, and sometimes as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why Federal Reserve officials have stressed so vigorously that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the trajectory of the time it takes for the situation to return to normal.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss associated with the interest rate increase has been oversized.
"The first increase in the central bank since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, Global Economics Specialist at Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be such a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have an impact.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of past developments:
As the market has seen in the past about a month, waiting for an interest rate raise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that return on capital tends to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which again potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years or so, the market tends to be strong, with an increase of about 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by senior capital strategist Bob Doll of Nuvee Asset Management.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate increases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces a number of challenges that have not existed in the past and that could accelerate the recession.
This is in particular the case of gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 withdrawals made since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5 % twice.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few people believe it will stand as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy can be risky and raise the question “is this time different?”
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank raise throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to end on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicts a probability of only 25%.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all upward cycles have so far occurred in increasing leverage supercycles, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery has begun,” the report says.
In contrast, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is in progress.
Fixed returns have also been volatile while the markets are waiting for interest rates to be raised, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its policy, its effects are more quickly reflected in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately after the first increase/reduction in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, yields on bonds will immediately fall," Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that raising interest rates will lead to convergence of longer-term and shorter-term bond yields, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns," Schwab's fixed return analyst Kathy Jones said in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the central bank’s policy expectations.
"Aside from the dollar's strength and falling inflation expectations, there are a number of indications that the markets have adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more flat, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies that are predominantly based in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a high level of debt are performing worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have finance.
"History shows that 'high-quality' stocks tend to be more lucrative in the three months after the first raise," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report addressed to customers.
Companies with strong turnover outperformed companies with low turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 percentage points for the first and 3 percentage points for the latter.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar’s rise in value.
Savers can also make profits with higher returns, although experts disagree about how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of “popularisation”
He argues that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
He also won the BBC Music Awards, claiming that they were just a copy of the Brit Awards.
Damien Collins criticizes The Voice for not being original
BBC Radio 3 is “becoming” Classic FM, claims a leading MP, increasing the pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio station appeared to be “publicizing” its content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term 'people's sense' - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He was also the target of the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, only seem to be a Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can directly remember of when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can’t learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey argued that the channel must do more work than before to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offering that was criticised for being on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, a member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced “pretty much in the BBC style.”
He added that he wants the production company to “find success inside the house” the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he refused to stop the production of future seasons of The Voice, or to order that the licensee’s money be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales have risen the least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw the lowest increase since the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many of the UK’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of a smoothing of online sales, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew the least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a flattening of online sales when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would rationalize over time," Andy Mulcahy, a reporter for the JMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales became stronger when buyers began using their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that more people would shop online, and that they could shop in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it is flattened, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowdown in trades.
Experts believe that consumers will restrain their purchases before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to their computers to snatch shops, knocking down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which led buyers to quarrel about discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane accident, Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia accuses construction giant Saudi Binladin Group of collapse
Health Ministry said 394 people were injured when the crane crashed.
Twenty-nine dead were carried in the air through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, while a crane collapsed in the great mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mostly dressed in white, made their way to honor the first dead who made their last trip to the Al-Moaisem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by a sacred place where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family building group was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed by a crane in the Great Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic-language version of the decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the cranes to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any announcements about the collapse of the crag and its representatives have not been apprehended for comment.
The royal decision also accused the consortium of not using up-to-date safeguards and not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Great Mosque of Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes that are part of a huge building raid led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and leads major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions enter the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every able Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered one million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the families of the deceased and the permanently injured.
The injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European low-cost workers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent of the city for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home renovation work
Looks like if you're good with a hammer or if you're good at painting walls, you're in the minority now.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to do do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said the popularity was driven by the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a ridiculous price.
Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in a store are made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more single-woman households where more home renovation work is done than before.
Laury said, “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead one of the most important companies in the UK’s FTSE100 index and has rebuilt her management team with equal numbers of male and female men.
Kingfisher is the only company with a group of nearly 50 percent women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It hasn’t been difficult to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher reported a drop in both half-year earnings and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns the Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The Three-Aces government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees’ central organizations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
I wonder if it’s worth a strike when it’s going badly.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they will not take part in the demonstration and will go to work.
In the good old days, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a rich man would have been a political suicide of a small man.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions with millions of members does not matter much, but it gives us something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement’s activities, the government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly rolling things around on their own, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the rights of employees, visibly and properly.
The government may thus wish to strengthen the role of the trade union movement when membership of the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the actions of the organizations, it is nonsense that the Friday demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
These things should force everyone's mind.
University of Lappeenranta: Target of 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching an austerity program that aims to reduce expenses by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations with the aim of saving 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
A further two million will be saved from other activities.
The reason for the joint negotiations is the 2016 budget, which forecasts an actual operating deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by budget cuts made by the government.
During this fiscal period, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenses will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the goal of saving is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the decrease in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli, University of Helsinki.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding is on new dimensions.
Negotiations with trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as stipulated by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The British owner of Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims for rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish railways.
Stagecoach is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, says Souter.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After short-distance traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe, has expressed interest in rail transport from other international companies.
The Federal Reserve has to make decisions on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching the Federal Reserve meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, a little more than half of those who believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has functioned relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into balance sheets and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the markets that they need to be ready for a raise, but the signs also indicate that they believe the odds are against a raise.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves a message of apology
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting a colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she was "sorry" about the first murder and hoped "that it could be reversed," officials said on Tuesday.
The Gautier Police of Mississippi reported that Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “adorable dog” in the house that “doesn’t bother anyone,” but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn’t say it.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb that read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing a note, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killing himself late on Monday while police surrounded him.
William LaForge, the university’s principal, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite allegations published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any "triangle drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a "good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "shocked."
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss was working online from home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called his relatives on Monday to tell them that he would not go to prison.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb graduated from Delta State in spring 2015, according to a curriculum vitae available on the University’s website.
Stars That Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a tough time in recent years.
In 2001, she contracted leukemia, and in 2009, her longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to a double break.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture of his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless thrust of Héctor Moreno 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV territory.
He was treated for nine minutes and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fractured leg, and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be moved tomorrow, or maybe a day later, and then cut off in Manchester.
It's terrible, a boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged slap.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you for all your messages, words aren’t enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I’ll be back stronger.”

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If one of the players gets out because of such an injury, everyone will be very sad.
The aim of our players is never to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not the intention to hurt an opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that's bad," Cocu said.
I didn’t see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke hitting it.
Moreno told SBS6, “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I’m so sorry.”
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent soon learns one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post post posted on the SuperCamps company’s website, and continues: “It’s fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always feels like there’s a picture or a message that we’ve never seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next paragraph where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details were added to fill a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, within the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son hopes to win the heart of his dream girl by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the real tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not write.
If this isn’t suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds in some places like it’s taken from a plot summary of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: “Inside the walls of the city of Targile, where everything is artificial and even the air is a merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win his dreams for Audrey girl’s heart.”
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which a young, unnamed boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, wood-piping, and supplies-knitting Kerskanen, regardless of the short, moustache creature named Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text was probably from Cameron’s constituency office.
Supercamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but made no further comments at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being cut off from the English team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think there’s a likelihood of a recurrence of the last 3-0 loss.
I wouldn't rule out a visitor win.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the three-year-old team, but there are good spinners involved and the team’s mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali evolves in his twist passes, and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth drops from England’s cricket team and is replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult for me to analyze because I am his coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their scores.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choices.
About a hundred more points, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he didn’t perform as well as he could, and that doesn’t surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected to the national team seven times, as Sam Robson was before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a batter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same chance as the others before him, but of course that depends on the team’s composition in the UAE.
The idea of a Moeen has been thrown into the field by Cook, so we could have an extra pitcher, but we could keep four fast, and I'm not against that.
I don’t understand why a batter can’t hit there, and this left-handed man has already proved to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is a third for them, and there is little difference in that.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first grid drop before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored 300 points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a striker and, with the little I've had with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unbiased stats -- hitting an average of 31 with the ball 35 -- and think it's gambling, but there's not too many pitchers out there, and the voters picked the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
Appointing Sri Lankan striker Mahehan Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball games, bringing both energy and a relentless glimpse.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be part of international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he’s got the same exploitable intelligence as Machela.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly’s teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting in a one-day race, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly don’t have any problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and elects do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Brexit supporters may win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-wild negotiating strategies to keep Britain in the EU face ever greater problems every day, even without even considering the heartfelt Jeremy 'Is it yes or no?' Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the indignation of the Confederation of Trade Unionists against Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply ingrained in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, full of controversy-provoking concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries largely do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are delaying summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local eye-catcher, and then coming home saying that they are winning supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward to the inside of the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France,' they say from Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care.
Germany’s cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to quit her post before it gets ruined in the same way that happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie Brits, when their energy would rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some such ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
“The re-negotiations were an arranged thing,” and “the re-negotiations had no significance to Britain.”
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press's monopolists are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU Straight Bananas" when he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
These included a diverse group of tax-absorbing scoundrels, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally domiciled elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you’re in a cage with a lusty gorilla, you have to give up bananas for a trick, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Mr Miliband was more blairish than Mr Blair himself when it comes to opposing Mr Cameron's negotiating stunt, because Mr Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Mr Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he didn’t have any more time to waste on me), seems in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock’s 80s boycotting Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
While it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside the UK Independence Party’s war-goal enthusiasm and the conservative party’s fiercest nationalists can certainly support this view.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and television this week when her internal scout wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the rough John McDonnell as the shadow government's finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his grandfather was struggling on TV to try to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's strains were more attractive.
But the struggle to stay on top of "any situation" -- Benn's statement -- was not what McDonnell said, and not, as it turns out, what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional, and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in the social media swirls, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour support for the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic twist on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of minor differences is a central dogma in doctrinal quarrels.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why would it be worthwhile for Paris or Berlin to waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when that can be completely futile?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded of at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health England's E-cigarette Review
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published this “milestone” report last month, describing it as “a comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the "extraordinarily weak bottom" of the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers at BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say the public expects the PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" is based on a detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO has previously been reported to have received funding from the British American Tobacco Corporation for an independent investigation.
He also supported BAT’s public health mandate in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not from the former alleged funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The criteria for the selection of the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also say they have received funding from the industry in the study.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco director of PHE also attended the meeting.
The research, produced by the group, "speakingly admits" that there is a shortage of "uncontroversial evidence of harm in most products and in most criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "so far, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made at BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of burners die of dependence.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public ignorance about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion each year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of conventional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for hits like this soap show on Albert Square.
Johnson said license fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs, which are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcast times against the most viewed programs of competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried Channel 4 for six years to build a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that are clearly suited to unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his study of the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not produce.
The Voice will be broadcast at the most important time of the year because of the desire to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, undoubtedly in-house implemented.
To be honest, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how this is about public service broadcasting.
I don’t think that would weaken the BBC at all.”
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting for spectators "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are reminiscent of those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC’s public service programs for a smaller audience “go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and can then hypocritically say in defense of <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in royalty revenues, ‘Yes, we do all these unknown programs that no one watches.’”
They put them in a place where no one ever comes to see them.
Regarding the fee, Johnson told the committee, “I challenge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a lot of value, but I don’t know if that’s true for those people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, because they don’t use much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its mission at Reith "to inform, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should follow the example of Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change the task to "inform, educate and entertain".
When it comes to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms, which he said are only a few on TV, and ally with commercial companies so that they can all be watched online.
"Sound Genetics" enables control of brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems to be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematode worms change direction as soon as they are struck by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasound-responsive membrane channels.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity With Light
The researchers said that worms show the effectiveness of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The nematodes normally do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then pass inside the worms.
Amplified ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the nematodes so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they switch on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a ground-breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along the optical fiber to a desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible for target human nerve cells to temporarily respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising Makes UK Arms Trade Shameful
Watch Amnesty International’s anti-subsidy video.
Terrible killing machines!
Crushing ankles! Crushing leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
As well as electric stun sticks that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and the graphics of the comics leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest trade fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell arms to oppressive regimes at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment in the London Shipyard.

As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared at bus stops and on subway trains, which demanded a closer look.
"Important announcement, Are you traveling on the DLR route from September 15th to 18th?" together asked using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a horde of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
These 300 posters were created by artists whose works were exhibited at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound package of six-six-keys that, according to the collective, "have access to one-third of the entire planet's ad space at bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this illicit "poster vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists on the opposition fronts when they realized they had to go outside if they wanted their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade greets commuters in the subway.
Amnesty International’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background reviewer worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin found that the trade fair was not advertised at all – and there was also a blank spot on ExCeL’s calendar at the time – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic obscure corporation advertisement, but "it was more stopping to emphasize it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the trade fair comes from the inside of ExCeL, with exhibitors selling fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that it had received an order from the U.S. military for a “shoulder-firing AT4CS RS.”
This includes "a unique tube-input combat tip that exerts excellent effects behind the armor inside the object".
Whatever it does, it’s not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Home
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student dorm at the age of 19, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the forced smiles of people I annoyed - and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learn can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from getting nervous to being totally scary.
It’s tempting to gossip: tell me where you’re from, if you’ve had a break and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why “I don’t really love or hate Marmite because it’s really just yeast extract HAHAHA finds me in my room.”
Take a breath.
And also help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you don’t want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they’re sharing fire extinguishers.
Make room for people.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and common places to have fun, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting college when you’re in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to rest, but many dormitories form a culture of room-to-room wandering that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can collect back the energy that I consumed when I talked with you.”
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing — and maybe send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Knocking when the call came: Knock.
One guy in my dorm thought that if the door wasn’t locked, he had been invited in.
He saw a lot of stuff.
Become friends through baking.
Since you're starting out in college during the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cake plate and introducing yourself seems somewhat less odd, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from a '50s.
Offering self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you know how to cook.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Understandably, stealing a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy - but try to treat it more adultly than my dorm mate who mixed detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn’t be making noises where people can’t sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot that's taunting the boiler.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music a little lower, because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music on, locked her doors and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm as you?
Or vice versa, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a dorm partner as your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all the friends you had in common with him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm partner is definitely not your future spouse, you could at least try to make sense with your bottom line.
In the exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it can be cancelled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling no more than twice.
Racist attack on accommodation for foreign students in Kitee - A house designed as a reception centre was slammed in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at Kitee’s Evangelical Folk School.
The windows and walls of the accommodation units were stamped with racist markings, such as hammer bars, and a metallic object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation units, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the teacher in charge of social security education for young people in the folk hospital, there were approximately ten people in the building that was the object of vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some of them might have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
There are people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has A status.
Some are in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies, and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be issued for a period of four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and violation of home peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held on Monday for students, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for more than a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects are believed to have been at least three men, who were on the move in a light car.
I think this is the caprice of a youth weekend evening when this topic has now surfaced.
“Nothing more serious,” he said.
A hospital has also been blasted in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday evening.
There was a swastika drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome".
A crime has been reported to the police.
Corrected incorrect information about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state shuts down the Y-train to Karjaa - passengers chewed up, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori will stop running in March.
The news infuriated the passengers boarding the train at the Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the Siuntio people will be hit by the winding down, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s completely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people working need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything other than a political will - or a lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video on HSTV that he will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
Purola’s station in Järvenpää and Nuppullinna in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and routes to be closed are available throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will later be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström, from Siuntio, believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than Raasepori and Siuntio because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling by train farther away from the city area.
"It's especially bad for those who have to re-plan their trip," he said while in pain on the Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train service is expected to be on the shoreline, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region Traffic (HSL) area, leading to Kirkkonummi.
This increases the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million a year for the Y-train, and the ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, however, the number of trains will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made annually with shifts to be cancelled, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is expected to bring the state 12.3 million annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The topicality of capital: "It is worth getting acquainted with Marx"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the GDP, in his book The topicality of Marx’s Capital, published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, of its internationalization and penetration into all spheres of life, of the concentration of capital and of the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-sighted.
The author list of the book, which is based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen, also includes Aalto University professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
After all, the former director of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Finnish Economy delegation is not a Marxist, is he?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not see Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
“The common belief is that the history of ideas tells about the wrong opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s prophecies went horribly wrong.
While Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early course of capitalism.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
We are now discussing Marx’s interests again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Maybe Marx can inspire someone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it is worthwhile to study Marx.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but still more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the years back.
“Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx’s way of thinking – just like with other classics,” Korkman says.
UN calls on war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The United Nations has called for a special court to investigate the war crimes committed during the civil war in Sri Lanka, AFP said.
The United Nations report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and Tamil rebels of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan civil war.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, the large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of a long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan armed forces of torture, kidnappings and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
The rebels are accused of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the creation of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo-test allowed social media to be weighed
On Wednesday there was a long foreign language in the matriculation examinations, most of which was English.
His English skills were tested by more than 16,000 candidates.
In the experiment, you could write the subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250 word essay in English could be directed to the owner of the advisory column of an online magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
She asked how to get parents to see things from the point of view of young people.
In total, there were four subjects, from which one had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking high school in Porvoo, evaluated the third topic.
The third topic was just a quote from former European Commission President José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one was nice, according to Lybeck.
They had to write a speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment as "quite normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was used to answer questions about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer turbot to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Autumn writings will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Swedish exam will take place.
In high schools, the exam is held normally, i.e. it is not affected by the employees’ demonstration.
The matriculation examination committee urges the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time for the audition.
You can also get an extension if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu with a gun
A shop was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando cape.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man threatened the staff with a handgun and took a small sum of money.
It's being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from the rest of Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block Helsinki’s centre on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people could arrive.
Members of SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Rautatientori at 11 a.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of police officers at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the gigantic demonstration runs smoothly.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed to motor vehicles between 9:30 and 14:00.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from Mannerheimintie to the west.
Will there be enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it seems to be enough.
I have no opinion on police work.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the protest.
The police don't tell us who the scouts are.
“Something is coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own,” Kujala says.
Police say they should avoid driving cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the centre of the city.
Stagnating traffic is expected from the morning until early afternoon.
With demonstrators arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the railway station.
Buses are usually far away.
The rest of the journey must then be walked to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The protest will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, will now be partly resolved by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to proceed calmly.
There are ordinary people working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also take place in different parts of Finland on Friday.
The Friday demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no good comparison in Finnish political history,” says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It’s no wonder that the U.S. government is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siiseinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish tradition of corporatism - and also those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard-handed approach interferes with the treaty law.
There are a lot of things that are really trying to get the U.S. movement on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay-Movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the union movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division that the demonstration creates in the crowd that the syndicate movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland protested in the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a gigantic demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorgestai, 1993, says Siiseinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho’s (central) government is stumbling from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earners’ organisations had never been as bad as under Aho’s bourgeois government.
Now, the relationship between the government and the union movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the days of Murros Thursday.
Besides, Finland’s most bourgeois government is now in power, says Siiseinen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were certain elements of the old working-class movement at the time.
Thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and possibly close daycare centres and schools.
Even if the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement has been quite peaceful in its demonstrations – even though the practices have become harsher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Demonstrators are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siiseinen says.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs, and the police prepared to get porkshit on their heads.
The firefighter strike lasted three months.
There were also strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metalmen took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended at the request of the Reconciliation Committee after seven weeks of strike.
The metalworkers received a 16% salary increase.
The electric strike in the spring of 1977 lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murros Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the Parliament House to protest in favour of work.
Firefighters on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters’ strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police were caught in the egg rain as farmers protested against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
In Spain, farmers flew tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a number of deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened strikes and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancy eventually accelerated the negotiations.
The Doctors Striked in 2001
"Doctors strike - forced," was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors’ wages.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support from Senaatintori in Helsinki to Parliament House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the cabin was in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria in a lorry were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by asphyxiation.
According to Yleisradio, who first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company operates, among other things, as a restaurant and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in Austria for smuggling human beings.
A Refugee-Kicking Captain, a Former Drug Courier and a Rich Businessman: The Story of Five Smugglers
A wealthy king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in smuggling people into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them out of my mind right away
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, as they are only 120 kilometres from the Italian island of Lampedusa.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has already done this hundreds of times with his blue, ten-meter wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for him clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis escalated again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers can barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
At midnight, the lanterns are extinguished.
On the first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the 20-metre-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's beating the hangers to death.
When he was spotted by the police, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the sub-Saharan region.
I hear his compatriots have to beat him for this.
I'll knock them out of my mind right away.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is running out of speed and he has seen his best days anyway.
For Goran’s customers, however, the most important thing is that the taxi is moving at all and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly accessible to families.
In the forests around the city centre, men traveling without their family stay in tents, lodges and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogova<0xC5><0xA1>a area, the great hub of human smuggling, people are deadly tired.
The Goran drivers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their thing once and that’s enough,” Goran boasts.
He says the Africans are trying to make a deal.
Goran doesn't like that.
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dump.
First you agree on a price of, say, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300, then they lower it to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200, and finally they offer <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about three hundred kilometers, most comfortably on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ruled that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and sneaks away.
Mercy at Work
A 35-year-old Congolais is called a Missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many of the refugees from the Congo are visiting, as well as a small centre for helping the Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business that transfers people from the Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the elastic band of white underwear peeks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and further to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money carefully and slipping amongst the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have had to flee their homes from violence.
Often this is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old ID card is destroyed and replaced by another one.
That's where the missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police will help.
The client is then redirected to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each staircase separately: filing an application to the Ugandan police costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150, and the migration process to a European country, for example, costs between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in a human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If a policeman stopped a car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be imprisoned for organizing illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been in jail for seven years for drugs.
When a taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest spot where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the UK.
Tom picks the right truck, makes sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example, and cuts off the safety wire in the cover.
It has to be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it’s more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting someone hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not be able to catch the sudden clandestine passengers at least before he arrives in the UK.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The rich Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and is constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury boat scam: Turkish ports rent yachts supposedly to take American or European families on nice tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are being loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of EUR 5 000 to 7 000 first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human storage, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People get stuffed in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it's given, you have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the deck throughout the journey.

He does not take care of practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other minors to take care of the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have purchased land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
In 2011, Muammer Küçük was arrested at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.

An American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500-meter runner who competed three times at the Olympics, has a new book that has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top condition and ran the second best time in qualifying.
In the final, he panicked.
From the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I pushed myself across the finish line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting money to have sex with strangers.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
The price of Favor Hamilton was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline spikes he had when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The dual life of the former star runner came to light in late 2012 when the magazine Smoking Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's statistic number one at 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympics.
World Champion rejoiced when the Alliance ruled the Norwegian skiing flower: "Straightback"
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the line of adequacy in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the whole summer and autumn from the sports contract as they did last year.
While the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup in the coming season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union had put the ski flower under control.
"Thank you for showing backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor,” he said.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the national team so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent a union that would also care for future generations and not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has granted Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug announced on Tuesday that he would like to compete in the Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup, as well as in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals, two of which were gold.
He was part of the team that won the gold medal last winter in Falun.
Bakery Turners Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Kilpi Day 25 September, events will be held in different restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Patisserie Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but the top restaurants checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of raising the awareness of Schildi restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in the restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant participates in the Shield Day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organisation, which will take place in different parts of the world on the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice for establishing a Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava Armed Forces currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy, is still permanently located in the area.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to the individual, placing the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the armed forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force Force School, the impact of which has also not been clarified when preparing the reception centre.
The case states that negotiations on the organisation of flight training and the possible arrival of a foreign operator at the airport have been held in Kauhava airport for the past two years.
The matter has been discussed with, for example, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Secretary General Arto Rädy of the Ministry of Defence.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions,” Niinistö said to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties in their residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about the management of the refugee situation unified all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we are facing great challenges.
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful of the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to him, the issue of NATO was also discussed.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia tells us that during the work stop, airport operations will be managed by superior forces.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes down the streets of Helsinki city centre
A demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of Helsinki city centre.
The police say that the streets leading to Rautatientori will be closed to cars at around 9.30-14.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed towards the Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu railway station.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people taking part in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tramway drivers at Friday’s demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday’s demonstration from the start of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The association of tram and subway personnel told STT this evening.
Most Alkis close for two hours, including posts closed
The Friday demonstration will also cause disruptions to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transports are handled in spite of the strike.
Food transports, hospital shipments and laboratory samples will also be handled.
You can find information about the services on Posti’s website.
Most of the Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The service union Pam has instructed its employees to halt work between 11 and 13 a.m.
Pam has also called on grocery trade workers to participate in a trade union demonstration.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open, if necessary, with the help of managers.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closing of individual stores.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki kindergartens will not be fully operational on Friday, reports the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency.
Because of the protest of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain kindergartens, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day-care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities and autism are organised normally.
The Board of Early Childhood Education promises to announce further changes tomorrow.
Media Scientist: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, diverse channels are needed in communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
We will also need such a direct talk channel in the future.
This will not be the last time,” Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio talks will become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle’s channels in the future.
If there are other channels, we’ll see.
We’re going to use this channel tonight, he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech to be given to the citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer argument.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in the arena.
The squirrel takes a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television speech will not tell about the more general introspection of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into their own hands and refuse to ask questions about the public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen from the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of Foreign Minister Soini’s recent remark that he does not follow the media agenda and does not let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not linked.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn’t react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcement issues in a democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken as given.
According to Koivus, television talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more available today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are only more of the same old ones in the promise, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
You also take a risk in this regard, if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will become the media for politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or general policy.
A cunning twist
In Sipilä’s forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister is not saying is also important, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, you have to look carefully at what Sipilä is doing and what he is not doing,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, the TV speech is a cunning move from Sipilä, because this way he can express his own view without the sound of gravel.
Unlike in a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions, this way the message is sent to the general public without a journalistic filter.
He skips the media and speaks directly to the people.
There is a danger, however, that the media will misinterpret the speech, because it will not be possible to ask specific questions.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä performs on TV - is it sweating, are your hands shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to put things right, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to communicate something, because here one is talking directly to the other person.
This is what President Barack Obama and his partners do on a regular basis.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister would like to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Employee groups will hold protests and strikes on Friday against the government's actions.
Chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would also allow discussion of the speech.
SDP chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä to engage in dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can’t hide indefinitely,” Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy was found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
The boy has been found and is OK, his father updated his Facebook page.
The Interior Finland Police Department will also confirm this to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play around four in the afternoon.
Later that night he was no longer contacted.
My father thanked all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed with youth’s violent craze: You create hate
Kurdish freelance fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook appealing especially to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a weighty statement against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says she received a message asking her to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the young man's craze.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking those on the ground, sitting on top of each other and beating them without even thinking about the consequences of this when you make videos like this.
Difficult to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki Police Department, both immigrants and young Finns have uploaded fighting videos to social media.
It's the fact that you're fighting on the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku recalls.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a few of these individual cases.
It's a little hard, boys, no more defending you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a long time.
That’s a slightly different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani encourages young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of any kind of racism, you can blame it on yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with it, guys.
My Amirkhani says that violent acts are fuelling racism.
You make me hate something I don’t like either.
Things are pretty bad for you anyway, and you won’t improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, the chairman of SAK, said on Twitter that on Monday the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Finnish Employees’ Centre organisation STTK announced earlier Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the Government, which would achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle).
Akava’s Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, the chairman of SAK, commented on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock” and that instead of compulsory laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to the SAK.
Sipilä earlier cut off negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a five per cent productivity leap.
Comments on: The Great Protest Threatens to Faint - "It Feels a Little Funny to Thinn My Fist"
After all, it feels a little funny to knit your fist if you already have reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospheres in the wage camps vary from one side to the next.
Is it to overthrow the government or to make a deal with it?
On Monday, SAK’s federal leaders blew out a sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the akavians.
Teachers’ union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be closed altogether.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the Central Staff Organisation of STTK, spoke in conciliation.
He said that he had been in contact with the Government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a five per cent productivity leap.
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder (cook), immediately rushed to announce that his pleading paper was already ready.
At first, there was no sign of the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "unlock the labour market".
In order for a joint proposal to be made by employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palolan STTK has good relations with the Sipilä Government.
Palola’s right hand, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the centrist prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the government’s trade know-how has been improving all the time.
Coincidentally or not, Palola's departure took a little bit of momentum away from the stoppers in Finland, whose front figure is Marko Piirainen (sd) from the AKT.
It feels a little funny to knit your fist if you already have a paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Speaker of the Russian Duma Sergey Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma President Sergey Naryshkin said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki General Assembly in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - an issue that the President would remind journalists of.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where he had also been denied entry.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to spike Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with the meeting leader Ilkka Kanerva (kok) in Ulan Bator, who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets a real playoff troll: "Goals in tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull-days in Hakamelästi today, when both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real goal celebrations in Hakamesti today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2-season win from KalPa.
The rise was masculine, as last season’s Silver Group was at its worst from a loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more win-win.
The roommates’ catch as a guest of the Blues, who had a tricky start, was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-attaker Janne Lahti anticipates the set-up on the club’s website.
It has become a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has just dropped Lock in the semi-finals.
In both cases, a decisive seventh match is required.
Last season, Lockuk took the series to a break in the fourth game, but in the next three games, Tappara rose to the front and past.
There are no major changes in the composition of the teams except for the goalkeepers.
Both of the box offices that were rejected yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the lock poles Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of View: An awful play in ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for the film Rocky, in which he himself starred in the lead role.
The underdog was sensationally pitted against heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky’s premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
To everyone’s surprise, the nameless and wooden-handed pot-pack progressed to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Mattia Porin and Pele from Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irokes.
She turned blonde.
The great TV reporter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that the novel of this season works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the sports director of the <0xC3><0x81>ssi has built a patataka on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating dudes in the distance like Rocky has been beating pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have their merits in something other than reel playing.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has named Iron Rock Sean Connery.
In Rocky, written by Toivola, Rautakallio is just as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no Rocky in Iron Rock other than a nickname.
Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing and squealing.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of Ässie slammed Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He was given 2+10 minutes by the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not approve of such a game and it does not belong to ace hockey, after the game the hot Iron Rock got angry with the Satakunta People.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's junkies, veterans, cops, prowlers.
There are practically no key players at the best age.
No wonder the coach complained of a shortage of skills.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect procurements and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's burning under the surface.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in taking the place of Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
Asses's balance in the three league matches of the season is equal to the number of losses in goal difference 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Claus's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would not have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Tuukka Temonen, a former bassist and director since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now for the first time Olga is acting under Tuuka’s direction.
Olga’s role in the movie “You made us beautiful” is drummer Sipe Santapuk’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka supports her son, even though his father, Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true role model Sirka, the easier it seems to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the duo have become much closer.
They've been meeting, talking on the phone, texting.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of their history from different angles.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and that the truth may need to be colored a bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
The '90s were a recession, and it was really sad.
There was little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
Parents’ stories are sometimes a little different.
Yes, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, how much do parents really know what you’re doing?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an ordinary and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuukka.
He could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that a big joint project is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iitti often intends to drive home overnight for their young children, as the distance is not too long.
We occupy Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 is Finland's Most Expensive Film
The budget for Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is the most expensive play ever made in Finland, with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The upcoming Angry Birds animation will also overtake Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over <0x24>100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will start shooting in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
The big budget is not scary.
I've been so sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the public,” he tells Iltalehti.
The original budget for the film was between <0x24>8 and <0x24>10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big story.
However, the movie could get <0x24>100 million, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that there is no loose one.
The film’s production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4 to 8% on Wednesday.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to the shirts
The fronts of the trendsetters have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, the fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or a t-shirt brand was seen as something of a jerk.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the boundary between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already a jerk, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, where trendsetters surprised me by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a way to stand out from the mass.
Instead of a gray basic college, we put on the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the closet with the logo in front of it.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas’ recognizable striped sweaters, favorite team shirts and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace’s autumn blouses makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.

Russian politician says he didn’t get stuck in a tank hatch for hours
It is alleged that a special incident took place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russian Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, colorful claims have been circulated in the Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Forces had to remove Zotov from a large tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking through the armored vehicle’s hatch in a very good mood, and at least according to the photos, it’s not about getting stuck or angry.
That's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian military television channel that he admired the new Russian technology in the show, as he himself was a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, I admired our technology.
“I came out through the trunk,” he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it stupid.
One fool wrote, and all the others repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went in and came out.
"I'm tall and sturdy, but nothing like getting stuck in a tank somewhere happened," he told Russian radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged blockage have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The allegation that Zotov was stuck was initially based on a story on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told that he was hanging out of the tank hatch trying to get out and that he was threatening to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of his way.
Later, Bloknot published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers shared their views on what happened.
Everyone is just accustomed to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," Alexander Pisarevsky, the exhibition coordinator, told Bloknot.

A leak has occurred in the Kittilän mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The refined process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The basin contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or injected into the environment via a surface drainage field.
The leakage was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit requirements.
No other material was leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been found to cause structural damage to the pool dam structures.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland’s country report, published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome its economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed in the entire contract system and in unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also slight differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of positive messages for the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
This includes infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Economics.
The IMF also believes that it would be worthwhile to implement growth projects as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts 0.4 per cent economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
In its new cyclical forecast, Danske forecasts growth to remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little bit more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output had increased slightly during the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention may have been paid to weakened industrial confidence or other so-called softer gauges.
However, the differences are only a few decimal places.
After death, Nintendo appointed a new director.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will begin work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as a possible successor to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata’s footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda for Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to force Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
Increasing number of minor asylum seekers arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country are missing each year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of minor applicants disappear every year in Sweden.
Juha Kannelmaa, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear “underground” in a year?- A total of 156 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, there were 196 similar applications and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The disappearance may be due to the fact that the case reveals that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications received a decision to lapse because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, a total of 586 unaccompanied minors have received asylum applications.
There are no statistics on the number of missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of missing minor asylum seekers is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to have an impact on the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been converted?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the rejection decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the meeting of EU interior ministers, spoke about practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media industry who has lost his ability to work due to illnesses, is now available for sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells on Huuto.net devices that were once the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online announcement was first reported by the Iltamakasini online magazine.
Nowadays, much of the equipment has been left behind by technological advances.
In the digital media world, there are no more TV shows on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be an interest.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is such old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks for IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've started to inventory and see what things are being given up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for television or radio.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man with a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to grow worse than expected: Metro and trams could stop all Friday
The subway and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend the force in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for Friday’s demonstration.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief Trustee Pekka Hirvonen says that there is a big hug on the field.
The cuts in night and shift shifts are badly hurting drivers, so the government’s plans to cut supplements stir up opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area is virtually at a standstill.
According to VR, trains do not run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no short-haul or long-haul traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left at the depot.
Members of the AKT will be away from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by managers,” says Pirkko Repo, HSL’s spokeswoman.
Repo says HSL is unable to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will hold a large demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, according to AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have attempted to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas after teacher thought home-made watch was a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought his self-made watch was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he just wanted to showcase the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were summoned, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never claimed anything other than that he made the clock.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, police said the watch looked like a “film bomb.”
The watch is in police custody, but it was supposed to consist of a printed circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was sentenced to three days of school leave.
His father is outraged by the incident, and the U.S.-Islamic Council wonders whether the incident is yet another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service commemorated the fight of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the labour ranks.
Particularly among Members of Parliament, there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament today for the first time as party leader during Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted last week about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
"The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families," he tweeted.
Cause of Minnesota family killing remains unclear: father faces trial
South Lake Minnetonka police are investigating a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for Days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of the children.
Based on this report, the police went into the house for an inspection and found the Short family dead across the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A millionaire and a successful company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motive for the hemorrhage remains unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on AllNurses.com, a social media site for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that the site had four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 bids for the company over the past 10 years.
I have abandoned them all.
I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the company at some point, but not yet.
Short’s family bought a <0x24>2 million house in Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for eight cars.
Proceedings pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
He had been sued by Achieve Test Prep for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website had not removed any slanderous comments about prep courses and had thus lost customers to its competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s business.

Pekka decides and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughing.
A stunning gesture from an NHL star - "The biggest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated <0x24>10 million to Montreal Children’s Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraisers for the next seven years.
Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens for eight years and <0x24>72 million.
Subban’s donation is therefore significantly higher than his annual salary of <0x24>9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby bearing his name from the hospital.
The players of the Canadiens have helped the local hospitals significantly in the past.
Captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another large hospital in the city to provide the hospital with a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese cafe for the evening - serves food only in bikini and a flip-flop
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
The market already has a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hali café and now a wife café.
It strikes lonely, companions and hungry people.
This is reported by Metro.

Soon 150 million vehicles are connected to the network: Car security attacks are underway
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological developments and innovations in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The panel consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel unveiled the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
In the future, the company will update the report based on the results of the ASRB’s research.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles will be connected.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, CEO of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish best practices on security and support the view that cybersecurity is a key component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS will cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>52,000 in Finland.
Ford’s Focus RS has been waiting for years to rise like a moon.
The car is finally in sight in Finland.
Ford unveiled the RS data now that the world of cars is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new all-wheel-drive RS, with its 2.3-litre 350-hp engine, accelerates in 4.7 seconds from 0 to 100 and has a top speed of 266 km/h.
In Finnish terms, the price is also interesting, initially it is said to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>52,000.
The car is now available to order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
Kia presents two new cars at the Frankfurt Motor Show – the new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish terms, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than two of the new ones, with which Kia intends to grab a bigger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of the new European design director Gregory Guillaume, the Sportage is rounder than before.
The distance between the axles and the outer dimensions has come one cent here and there, and the car is more efficient in venting the air.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
Read more about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive for us in the spring of 2016.
Already before the turn of the year the new Kia Optima arrives in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with improved driving performance, lower noise levels and improved equipment.
Optimas with 1.7-litre turbo diesel and 2.0-litre gasoline engine will start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the arrival of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer will begin.
Chisu returns to the stage - smashed in a bold overalls
Singer Chisu participates in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a striking, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the singer's delicate waist.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to shed her kilograms of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisun's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn’t really excite me.
I’ve missed everything that’s related to music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will be releasing their fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to create new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian’s maternity style stuns again
Reality TV beauties Kim Kardashian talks about one thing after another.
She displays her breasts and belly in sexy clothes, most recently at 1:00 a.m. last night when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left her husband Kanye West gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-coloured bra underneath the dress when the lightning flashes.
The last time Kardashian wore an amazon-like maternity uniform was when she visited a friend for a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black overknee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when I had a pregnancy tummy.
Hard Laws of the Model World: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition is Horrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to make it clear that the world of design was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you’ve been posing in top designer outfits, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with the hardcore.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is a continuous journey, and it can take up to a year to accommodate a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful ones.
There's not just one type of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to lose a few pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
At the fashion week, models and designers are always together and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is bleak.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a showcase of clothes.
Models want to be their own people.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Week, where designers will unveil their collection for next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band’s founding member, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala formed Apulanna with Toni Wirtanen in 1991, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I’m about to be a rapper, and in this movie I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I haven’t wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar to people in that group, so I think it's good that I just learn her playing style from video.
I don't want to make a human imitation.
The man who leads Scrooge Salminen and Dogs is not going to take on the role.
Punks come naturally.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many of you probably saw a taste of it, as well as if you have ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
The main actors of Tuukka Temonen, who played the bass in Helsinki from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core group of the band, which has become familiar to the general public, is performed by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santa Pukki will be performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip on his upcoming job last night, when he told Snapchat he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a photo of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he had to make for the film.
Scrooge, who had previously seen his mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face like a silo beak and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist: How to Tell Your Kids About Refugees
In the past few days, many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees trying to come to Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
The issue does not need to be brought up by force, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR’s crisis team.
Younger children should be protected and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and annoy them, she says.
However, if a child has come across news photos of refugees on TV or heard about it from elsewhere, it is worth talking about it.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he or she asks.
Children’s fears can be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You shouldn’t frighten a child for nothing, even if you are bothered and frightened.
The younger child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Older children are likely to run into conversations about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents should discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and children can think together about how this will be handled in our family.
Is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives – some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child will have a model for dealing with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Your own power out?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Ball lightning hitting the verge is hard to contain
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind Apila’s Ball Lightning to a heavy impact in the middle of summer.
It only led to victories and second places, until at the end of July the raves in Tampere collapsed.
As the stallion froze to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time from the vet for his guardian.
The explanation for the extinction came through the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not from the mildest end, but took two courses of medicine to control it.
Since Palloslama had to do light exercise, Pohjola says that she was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE dam in Turku in record time after Taruntuuli.
Apila’s Ball Lightning was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had only been possible to drive normally for a few weeks.
With those things in mind, the slight leaning at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good race would have made the stallions feel better.
The horse’s spirit certainly moved on from there, and hopefully it would have been evened out.
Ball lightning has been the so-called humor horses.
When he didn't like it, he could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
Instead, on a good day, the stallion has been so disconnected from the lightning bull that the opponents have been amazed.
At long-distance speed, fellow competitors can’t compete with a Ball Lightning, from which even warm-blooded rides are detached.
The hopes of the Nordic region are in Vermo.
However, the other thing is how the Ball Lightning of Apila agrees to it.
It’s quite difficult at the time of departure and you might even stumble under the boom of the departure car and so on.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when we leave.
When he is in good shape, Ball Lightning can also come from the bow, and we will drive with it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you can’t get rid of unnecessary iPhone apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, said Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of apps that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime Calls, Kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these apps is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update for iPhone phones, although it’s only needed by Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, uninstalling Apple’s apps is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone,” Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work in conjunction with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical authority.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by cheaper energy.
Eurostat thus revised its forecast of 0.2% slightly downwards a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0%.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU-28 was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Among euro area countries, consumer prices rose most in August, i.e. by 1.4 per cent.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target of a price increase of around 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years of the Fed’s resumption of interest rate hikes.
And the downturn in the financial markets will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rate increases may start this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession may hit the fastest by next autumn and the pace of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that’s what will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets are operating as they used to be – and if they react to the Fed’s blackmailing of money taps as they have done in the past.
These are the conclusions reached by the London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of Deutsche Bank in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international customers last week.
The strategists who drafted the study and the report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations from economic statistics to present how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or another pattern as at the time of previous interest rate hikes — and what the consequences may be.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to withstand the rise in interest rates than they have been since the 1950s.
At the start of the recession, not a year.
Throughout the summer and early autumn, the Fed’s monetary policy leaders have suggested that the time is ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in over nine years may come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed’s Executive Board meets to decide on the matter in its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate was in June 2006.
At that time, the two-year series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points ended, by which the Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
In 2007, the financial market began to suffer from the most risky housing crisis in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the serious adversities in the financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than they have typically been since previous Fed interest rate increases.
Similarly, the trials were harsher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world’s largest economies and the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
They have been reporting on the Fed’s interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the first interest rate increase is less than one year, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The price rise on the financial markets has ended within a year-two of the beginning of Fed’s interest rate increases.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, the Fed has alternately increased and decreased its steering rate by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has differed in some respects from the other, and the number of times is relatively limited in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude with certainty on the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
The strategy reminds us that many things are different this time.
And not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, cannot be unambiguously identified even by decades of research.
However, three facts about the causes of the crisis and its devastating effects are more or less undeniably clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno-bubble, while growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in different parts of the financial and real economy grew even larger as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in the history of the economy.
3) The insane debt financing, which was packed into the financial economy without any restraint, swelled up the largest bubbles in the history of most financial markets, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is unlikely that there will be a very strong controversy that the high financial markets, relying on increasingly complex debt levers, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state of affairs as the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures based on leverage, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last until after interest rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned upwards.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists don’t guess what will happen next, but they give a clue by mentioning things like:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept the tuning of their monetary policy even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for too long.
2) Indebtedness has not been insanely cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, but is now literally cheaper than free debt money at its lowest cost.
As a result, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but is now being heavier in different parts of the economy than it was before the financial crisis or at any time before.
3) The liquidity emitted from central banks, which has been lower and cheaper than before, has remained largely in the financial markets and has slowed down key securities and asset classes to their highest value, whether at the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
And the strategists not only latentize the mood with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades to the pattern it has seen in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are incomparably greater than they were before the financial crisis when the Fed next starts tightening its money taps.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards, a strategist at Societe Generale, is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
For some time now, he has been preparing the bank’s international investor clients for the following Fed’s full translations:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst – and soon it’s time for the Fed to rush out to extinguish the financial fires with even larger QE money jets.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will go to HP’s business service side, the company says.
In November, HP will be split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the number of personnel had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises a one-off cost of <0x24>2.7 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
On the consumer side, the reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the previous year, its three most significant customers accounted for 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation when the "Software Update Failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also simplified the process with a new tool that suggests apps to be removed and then reinstalled when the update is complete.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or close to the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out, it may result in the update being compromised.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, whose Board of Directors Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had filed for membership in May this year.
I checked and it is enough that I have filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg-based company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on Karelia-Upofloor’s Board of Directors from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, on Kährs’ Board of Directors and on the Luxembourg-based company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ ownership in Luxembourg passes through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second-largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, a company owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the income from capital of Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest shareholder of Kährs, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a company-maintained reception centre
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers will be opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first 100 residents as early as 6 p.m.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the former Rescue School.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which specialises in the provision of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agreed, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative blackmail package
STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government’s workforce blackmails.
The organization also wants to include other employee centers.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently focused on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists during the break from the meeting of the organisation’s administration.
Palola believes that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change protection contained in the Government’s competitiveness package costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if a party has a great desire to have a discussion if there's a one-to-one ratio on the side of 100.
Palola: Negotiations were constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has asked for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is due to submit a notice to Parliament on its own package and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the Government, and it has always been constructive to him.
According to Palola, the operation of the staff centre organisation STTK’s field, especially Sunday allowances, is a painful place.
The organization demands that the government retreat from the coercive legislation by which it would carry out some of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STTK is not warming to the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the SDP, which has been presenting the issue.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government’s blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first sick days will be cut, overtime allowances will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
It is stressed from the STTK that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and it was not intended to organize a strike.
Akavan Fjäder
Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, praises STTK’s announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change protection and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal, with which it is ready to negotiate the government’s goal of a 5% competitive leap as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are ready to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava’s lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package will not be strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the country’s government and employers,” Fjäder said.
The Akava Bureau will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, let's work" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
University of Tampere Green Left Viva Bingo Coupon for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously made extraordinary speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and wars.
In a very exceptional way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When applying for a similar speech by the Prime Minister, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä uprising.
Thereafter, the President and the ministers made several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators with a televised speech.
Monologue, monarchist talk
His speech has been a source of criticism and conjecture all day long as to what is to come.
Chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that "Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Greens, "the single-talk has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, SDP’s Erkki Tuomioja denounced that “monarchist thinking: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them.”
SDP chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Shortly six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is <0x40>sheepsilicon afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it will be commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
I have been criticized for making a speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity throughout Finland, Yle’s Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle said in the news.
Like in the days of the oaks
The speech has also sparked mockery.
In the evening, the dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on the prettiest tie, and Dad sews a tie around his neck.
At nine o’clock, you’ll be silent in front of the TV as you used to be in the days of Me Tammela,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaires sitting in the Finnish government in tax havens hiding their capital, drafting amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time saying to the people that they must cut when the state is running out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has posted the following bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear tonight about the same boat, the common coal, the debt of living and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia’s proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected a Russian offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad out of power, President Martti Ahtisaari told The Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would have allowed Assad to resign in style after a while.
However, the West refused to accept the proposal, believing that Assad would fall in a matter of weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin told him in a bilateral conversation about the plan on three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, talks between the opposition and Assad had to be made immediately, and the resignation of Assad had to be carried out in moderation.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, “Sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell you what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment.
Ahtisaari said he had forwarded Churkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr Churkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but Mr Ahtisaari said there were no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s allegations, but said that al-Assad’s forces had already committed several massacres at the time and that the main opposition groups refused any agreement that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department at the British Foreign Ministry, hesitated at Ahtisaari’s speeches because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has officially supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Churkin spoke under Moscow’s authority.
If he had told me about Churkin’s speeches, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin’s trick to hold power over an al-Assad supporter.
The Flood of Our Own Deeds
During the Ahtisaari talks, around 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll at the beginning of this year exceeded 220,000.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own work.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying an invoice that we ourselves created, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The Asylum Seekers Organisation Centre in Tornio
The asylum seekers’ organisation centre planned by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tornio joint building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a space solution to the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen, Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not present and part of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
The meeting was attended by 36 of the 43 delegates.
Thirteen delegates opposed the organizational centre.
On the basis of this, one could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated at a time.
An expert has checked whether it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), a halving of holiday pay in public would only cover part of the government’s aim to lower the price of work.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package with him if the social partners were able to agree on it.
He told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for ways to compensate for the government’s announced blackmails.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s view, halving holiday allowances would be a viable means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the cut in Sunday allowances planned by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on cuts in holiday allowances, as they are recorded in collective agreements rather than in the law.
The Government will inform Parliament on Wednesday next week about the blackmails in working life as a Government announcement.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative process then starts, meaning that the train is moving and it is getting more and more difficult.
It's a very good time.
It doesn’t take long for such things to happen, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, changing Epiphany and Thursday into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, wages for the first sick days will be cut, overtime allowances will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as coercive legislation bypassing trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
As a result, a large demonstration will be held on Friday by the central wage-earners' organisations, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves expansion of juice hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved the expansion of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the juice hall.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
It also has a busy schedule.
It was also a bit surprising that the demand for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment plan, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
At the meeting, the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väisto (ps.) justified.
The language of Karelia in Joensuu
The City Government relaxed its previous stance to bring street name signs in Karelian into the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu area has been more part of the Eastern Savo dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, on a case-by-case basis.
The city recommends the same to all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language is also worth taking a broad-minded approach now that multiculturalism is also living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used in various marketing activities in the province.
Termination of train connections reduces the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections are hitting the vitality of the province hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s economic life and competitiveness.
And it affects whether you can live and work here at all,” Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlighted the issue of air transport, which has also been included in the report on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that our chances are not reduced by measures taken by state power, as is currently happening.
We should look at the effects of these shutdowns on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it will be to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor accessibility also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university to Western Finland because of poor cross-border connections.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
Approximately 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
From the riverside came a gravel sound for Siu's war
The City Council of Joensuu’s view of the provincial Siun ware project is seemingly unanimous, but one of them is gravel.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Board (sd., in the photo) proposed abandoning the entire project at the Board meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed as unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s draft resolution, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit with one less train service.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train is cancelled, but five times a day it is still possible to get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchase money for rail transport for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off the scene
The Rescue Department let a 12-year-old climbed from a chimney to the roof, but he couldn’t get down from the roof by himself.
The situation took place in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys from climbing the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same road, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slipped away and the passers-by alerted the rescue team to help the last person left safely on the roof to return to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit doubles, lowering fiscal year 2016 outlook
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the shipping giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
By this time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
Its share fell by approximately 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the fiscal year to end in May at <0x24>10.40 to <0x24>10.90, which is 20 cents lower than its previous forecast.
Analysts expected <0x24>10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came in spite of an average price increase of 4.9%, which will enter into force on January 4, and despite the higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels that began in November.
The company said it expects its operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “will perform steadily considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in terms of production and global trade.”
Plans for salaries during the holiday were announced the day after UPS announced that it would hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra employees, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share was <0x24>2.42, which is left behind the <0x24>2.44 average forecast. The survey was conducted by 12 analysts from Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales increased by 5% to <0x24>12.3 billion.
In a Zacks survey, six analysts expected <0x24>12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transport, which has halted the growth of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the performance of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the country unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the operations were basically the same due to the high costs of larger parcels and self-insurance.
The Express unit’s revenues were higher due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased due to higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx’s shares fell by <0x24>3.85, or 2.5 percent, to <0x24>150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed down 11 percent this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
This week, the Federal Reserve is sitting for two days on a huge mahogany table at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the key rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that central bank president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests first.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Recession, however, the governors of the central bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement could be the decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record short-term stimulus brought about by the near-zero level of interest rates since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows steady economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets may have made central bank officials, who are already on guard, even more frightened when it comes to increasing volatility. There are fears about what the effect would be if the federal funds rate was raised by even a quarter.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economics specialist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for keeping interest rates unchanged, increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid enough reason to wait," he said.
There has been no agreement on the Central Bank's decision, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that the chance of growth is only around 30%.
This suggests a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the policymakers then manage to soften the shock by promising that the next raise will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, the new figure being 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would maintain its level this week, says John Lonski, chief economics officer at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they will have to put a lot of effort into their policy to support the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their elections.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to what the central bank regards as the threshold for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of recovery.
While inflation is still below the central bank’s 2% annual target, the central bank’s decision-makers say the main reason for this is the temporary effect of the substantially lower oil price.
The economy “can cope with even higher interest rates and needs them in view of the tight labour market conditions,” says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the global financial markets were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16 percent from its May record, with investors fearing that China’s slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below its peak in May.
For central bank policy makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks about China's economic weakness, policymakers would tighten the tide at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still rather unclear, and they have little information at their disposal about the consequences of what happened in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, a suggestion by the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could “restrict” the increase in the amount of money, caused turbulence in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more an art than a science,” says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be separated from economic fundamentals.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for interest rates to be raised, and Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, is citing the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings “despite its limited, recognisable impact on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritise financial stability during a major crisis, such as when the markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate setting committee.
The latest turmoil will not come close to its level, Posen says.
"Nobody wants a situation where there is fear of a rise in interest rates because the market is getting upset," said Posen, chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's pediatrics agency in Rio Grande promotes healthy diet for nursing mothers
The Brazilian Agency for Pediatrics (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing images of babies suckling breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the immune system of the child.
Seven Channel’s Sunrise program is a favorite among viewers, despite Nine Channel’s efforts to report a leader revelation on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party’s revelation failed to increase Today’s audience.
The Nine-channel morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Australian television viewers didn’t seem to be bothered by the distance, with Sunrise’s average viewing in five state capitals being 397,000, compared to Today’s 339,000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, today’s average was 318,000 and Sunrise’s average was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, while Today has 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news on the Seven Channel was the 800 Words series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing premiere.
The new drama series, which gathered an impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson would be the driving force behind the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real assurance.
Seven's The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a dual destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new quiz program attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers – which was enough for a small win on Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour average was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour had a staggering 720,000 viewers.
The average for Hot Seat was 620,000.
The second night of The Chase Australia’s decline in the average viewership gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce McGuire’s audience.

The final trio agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Has the secret been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor has been kept utmost secret.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women were poetic about how Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positivity as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
When they were asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to?”, their answers may have provided a revelation as to who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been straightforward since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies [of Sarah] and the energies of Sam seemed quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really earthy, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a great partner.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game – I’m now wholeheartedly involved in it,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was a mystery.
"I don't know if I can tell," he said.
I like the other girls equally, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 pm on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, which seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first kickback when the team defeated Minnesota on Tuesday with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next shot and took him into the running after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his newcomers a polehead in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne drops a shot from the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
This was definitely not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for for the man’s NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way out of the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio couple Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his stunt to his 2007 Origin debut when a assist in his own goal area led him to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed on her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
Four killed in police shooting rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the country's new draft constitution, officials said Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandú.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region's chief official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous option, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group is demanding its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of them police.
At that time, the four main parties signed a treaty dividing the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted this week on the clauses of the constitutional draft in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) says there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
On the wide low-pressure front, about 560 kilometers south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center of the United States said on Tuesday.
Another high-precision low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde archipelago and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane over the next two days, the Miami-based weather center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million to humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it posted the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of the announcement being made by the executive, a Google employee, Rita Masoud, wrote about her personal experience as she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations are made to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will make the same amount for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief for up to <0x24>5.5 million, with a total target of <0x24>11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight Loss Surgery May Help Slightly Obese Diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after a weight loss surgery than those who are treated in ways other than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery specialist who wrote an editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the participants in the study have been morbidly obese and have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI above 25 indicates that someone is overweight, and a person with a BMI above 30 is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, with type 2 diabetes medications for people who were slightly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the surgical subjects decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, people treated with non-surgical methods had a BMI that remained roughly the same at 29.
Of the surgical subjects, 36 percent had a complete and 28 percent partial improvement in diabetes.
By comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely cured by only 1% and partially cured by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and the “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored the patients’ blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved “glycemic control,” as demonstrated by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared to the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery, the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had decreased its BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), had decreased haemoglobin A1c more than its levels (3.1 and 2.1 %), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 and 16.7 %).
Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show any improvement in surgical survival, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The findings are decisive in that they show that surgery is safe for a group with a lower BMI," he says, "and not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease."
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when a patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ll wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that when a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK, dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, while the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
While commenting on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US’ violent response caused a chain of drastic events.
“After 9/11, in a letter to President Bush, I expressed my condolences and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used force and that created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, children’s hand disinfectant ingestion has quadrupled
Poisoning Centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in the ingestion of heavily alcoholic hand disinfectant by children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Poisoning Center.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poison Information Center, cases of disinfectant ingestion reported to poison information centers among children under the age of 12 rose from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 161,17 cases in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap riser.
According to reports, teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand deodorants) are those with an added scent.
There are strawberry, grape and orange scent disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain anything from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Hospital's Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don’t leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand sanitizer is left out, and if the kids are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberry scent hand disinfectant at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit for adult drunk driving, says Chris Ritchey, an ambulance doctor who cared for the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed as he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible symptoms of brain injury, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and remove the disinfectant from children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York State planned to poison their “evil” teacher by spreading bactericide in the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from her class.
The police must prevent the plan from being a "stupid nonsense" and leave disciplinary measures to the school district.
Celtic: No Controversy
Griffiths despises talk of Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn.
Hearts fights Scottish football federation against Neilson’s charges, and Warburton is on guard against January recruitment that could disrupt the team’s unity
Dons increase lead to five points for Celtic
Adam Rooney's penalty shot in the first half led to Aberdeen's narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the distance to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths underestimates talk of contradictions
Rumors have emerged about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately overcame them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Dutch league leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are waiting to face it.
The lack of a Scottish championship is boring to the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the highlights of Celtic games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't in.
People around here just can't talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and the non-Scots also like to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the consequent fall in the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss to Aberdeen, a ten-man player who is now at the top of the series with a difference of five points to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad periods in the past, and we're going to rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters, because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard for January transfers
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on possible January transfer targets, he is on guard against the most recruitment, assuring that he does not want to confuse the team with consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the whole season ahead, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is linked to Celtic in the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has had ankle problems for two years, and during the summer he was unable to find a new player outside of Wales.
Hearts Ready to Fight Scottish Football Federation After Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the pitch, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card already condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was revoked.
Neilson insisted, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths swore to avoid Tynecastle.
A loyal Hibernian player was convicted of singing an insulting song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a whim of the moment," the attacker said, adding, "I think it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to play for Celtic."
Tannadice's Board of Directors believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims the Dundee United board still has faith in the ability of the management team to reverse the situation, but admits that the weakening of the players must stop.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes welcomes 'ugly victory' in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty shot, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, raising them to the top of the table by five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, “There is no team that has won anything, whether it’s a trophy or a league, that hasn’t won games in this way either.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains the same as the total number in the UK increases
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9% is higher than the UK’s of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The long-term plan of the government is to build the foundations for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention of any kind, I will see the man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting in the audience's gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacant seats, participants are selected through a terrifying draw.
Oklahoma has reduced media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever chooses, watches the event coolly.
I can't do it.
I am going to sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also made my own contact with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can’t be both a witness and a journalist, so I’m not allowed to have a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try and remember all the details.
An Oklahoma reporter tweeted that I have compromised my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get involved.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "he could have written his words better", but he still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I have told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the anti-death penalty trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I will not go over all the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would, in any case, make him guilty of aiding.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view I see him dying from.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man pulled out of Canning River after watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters away from a policeman who was trying to "gently lure him back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were summoned to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorised intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
But he did not go very far.
"She was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, I'm coming to get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: a "decent police negotiation."
“Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody Says Officers Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to Stop Competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria’s officials tried to infiltrate his team last year and threaten to stop competing immediately.
He blames the officers and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign running against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to a treatment procedure on the race day was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what’s best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has been keeping his tongue in check with spy allegations for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like jealousy.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything blows up at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation would continue.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I’ve said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head upright and I want the owners to think that I’m doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — I name him when asked — and offered him a job in my stables if he conveyed information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, surely they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming personal?
Is Victoria Racing finally determined to become a man and perhaps pass on the responsibility not just to the coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they’ll have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I’m saying now might make them think about it.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and that saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with the long-term cobalt research of Lidar, and his late rejection made him realize that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for coaching the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of racing day care measures “laughing” after a mud or clay bath has been put on a horse’s legs, which is irregular.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on it.
It could've had a burial last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on the race day.
Moody may face a three-month suspension due to a race day incubation, which was investigated by the commissioners.
It's a joke. It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobra's driver is arrested
Police have arrested a man who was convicted of a traffic flight after colliding with a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured when he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with non-stopping in an accident, neglect of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL rugby leagues championships’ claims that his team’s strikes are part of the “line”.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the arbitrators allowed Storm to "wrestle" on his own side after he unexpectedly won the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely able to cover up his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals Saturday night. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "show window" and said that two Queensland teams weren't "highly enthusiastic" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's strikes and said they were just focusing on "contact" while tackling.
Bellamy added that her confidence was heightened by criticism from two leading coaches of Storm, which meant they were afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks we have only stressed contact in the tacks, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coach, the St George Illawarra Dragons, won the championship in 2010 by playing "borefully".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
"He felt it was important to compare Saturday night's game to our Friday night's game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 that St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought out that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby – not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like this because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more scored than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the defensive line and fail to score?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is off this weekend as they have already won the right to play home against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man gets <0x24>200,000 bail on drug charges
A man threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail for <0x24>200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of drugs for a Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic is threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to possess cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he might have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In a court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered <0x24>200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the imposition of a <0x24>200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was given bail on condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passports, reported to the police on a daily basis and maintained a curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girl's Phone to Entice Pedophiles to Send Pictures
The paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online messaging service where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found the shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, searched the computers on the spot and found "worrying" web searches using keywords used to search for immoral pictures of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done this “to lure pedophiles” on the Internet, before he “pretended to be a police officer to scare them.”
Fiscal Deputy Representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done computer searches, but said they were only done to pretend he was a policeman so he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures, and when Hogg asked him to send more pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that if he drinks, he's sick of his head, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying.
Mom saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then faced the accused.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than she.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking photos of immoral children on June 14 of last year, violating his guarantees on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked not to include Hogg in the sex offenders’ register, as it could be argued that his crime did not include a “significant sexual element.”
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed his sentence until October to give social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's in custody before trial.
He was included in the sex offenders' register before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes a false speech to Parliament
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also stained by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to buoy Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him in intermissions as he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is headed 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that the immunity of Parliament would end and that, when they stepped out, the parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is preparing to cut 25,000-30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the fastest growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will bring about <0x24>2.7 billion in costs starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into new kinds of business,” Whitman said.
As a standalone company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will generate annual revenues of more than <0x24>50 billion and will “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated technology solutions to companies,” the company said in a statement.
The division dissolves the company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical supplies in a garage in Palo Alto, known as the "Silicon Valley Birthplace".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., and its division is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it’s only September and that assuming that his rehabilitation is going as planned, there’s no reason why he won’t be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will compete in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that the end of Wilshere’s last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"Such a disability does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but as Wenger admitted, there is always a risk of further injury when a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he has played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider set since the 2007-08 season, in six out of eight seasons, it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to an injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their improvement in last season’s disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when recovering from an injury, it can be a period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m sure it will, and that he can make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to re-enact his team as Arsenal starts their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players a break," Wenger said.
While Arsenal is a clear follow-up favourite of the F-group, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from last season’s Champions League surrender against Monaco and is still driven by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup win.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in the last fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it is three times more common among men than among women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the men’s year, with the aim of challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 high-school and high-school students with depressive symptoms found that a person's chances of recovering doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of their friends were "healthy".
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the probability of developing potential mental health problems was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this time of social media communication, style goes beyond content, and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - the inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly doesn’t make you happier.
The beauty of friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in the interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all of this, even though they often hesitate to explore their emotions completely.
As a Samaritan volunteer explained to me: “When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.”
Men who contact us often feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of “getting over” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term ways of coping.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my impartial, outsider position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And if you're going to comedy central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the sets have been redesigned to celebrate the festival, why not take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.

Di Maria takes a goal and helps PSG slap Malmö on the side
Angel Di Maria, Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavani to score against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut helping PSG overtake the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in her Champions League debut, showing the French champions the way, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their lead when Cavan scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, which is in the same group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a sequel in the game, but also an improvement in their quarter-final games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG scored, it wasn't a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a spot in front of the goal and was later replaced on the pitch. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even if there are some things we have to hone this season," Blanc said.
This is a good foreshadowing.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we were not able to score one or two more goals.
After an injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes made after the team tied 2-2 in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine wingman was named the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass stuck behind Malmö's defense line and then hit a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland at the back of the net.
If anyone expected a big and easy win for PSG, they would be disappointed.
Malmö was a clumsy opponent. He defeated Celtic in a decisive game when he reached this level, with nine international players and five-man defense in the opening field, and two players in the deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic’s shot in the 34th minute, which just passed by Kevin Trapp’s goal pole.
On the other hand, PSG was occasionally in trouble due to lost assists and poor finishes, especially by Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half alone and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in after Ibrahimovic touched him right at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in his pre-work with his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent a twist that tipped around Wiland's goal post at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play, thanks to Cavani from Uruguay, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic snapping Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and it was only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's straight kick that kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was discarded at the end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was at a level higher than his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying is not enough.
I'll take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises <0x24>2.5 billion by selling shares
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, who suffered from a commodity price collapse, raised <0x24>2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its comprehensive debt cut plan.
In a statement, Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion in new shares to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the slowdown in the Chinese economy strains demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The issue raised the value of Glencore’s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday’s morning trades.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up by 0.69 per cent.
Glencore had unveiled a <0x24>2.5 billion stock deal last week as part of a broader plan to cut its <0x24>30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold its new share capital for 125 pence shares, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Worries about China’s long-standing stagnation in growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
President Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner for Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“Present X’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to constructively discuss issues where there are differences,” the statement said.
The visit, first announced in February, also expects Xi to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a number of U.S. technology leaders before moving on to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon underestimates differences in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown in a conversation about a difference that Damon says isn’t needed behind the scenes.
During HBO’s Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown, stressing the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the screenplay chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when selecting actors for the movie, not the series," Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted with disbelief to the offended, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay," while the comments of The Martian's actor were left hanging in the air.
The other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists.
“I want people to think about how they treat Harmony’s character, whoever the director is,” Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer demanded rights to direct the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their directing "may end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing, "Matt Damon speaking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Since its release, it has collected more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social conversation.
After a white police officer killed a teenager named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminating against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the Album of the Year nominations for the Grammy Award.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement in response to Fox News’s face Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon was among the entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion is crowned.
On Monday, professional rock climber and utensil collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and win the <0x24>1 million prize.
In the competition programme, which ended its seventh season, there has never been a competitor who has survived all the sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to clear the exhausting fourth installment of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still shocked to win the <0x24>1 million prize.
“It’s great to think about this, since I’ve never made or lived on more than <0x24>10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big pay rise.
So all of a sudden... so I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten is not getting more reward money, even though he is the first racer ever to pass the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money will go to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he's got any grudges about that.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had been the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns for the eighth season, which will begin shooting in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers sneaked past the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their full-blown role on Tuesday when they won the Minnesota Twins in the 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get halfway out of the Houston Astros in the race for another American League wild card position.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they are won," Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) passed 6 1/3 in the innings and let go three runs.
This was his third game in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It’s hard for a trader to pass in every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers deputy Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, his first beaten run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He shook the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting rehearsals), looked significantly better in batting rehearsals and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Byron Buxton started the innings by hitting the left field line twice.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks got home at the touch of a single base, and Simon was able to burn down the second base player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player to face, ahead of the novice substitute striker Miguel Sano, who pulled a two-nest run to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and a leveling runner on the second base, VerHagen managed to beat third base Trevor Plouffe in a double landing.
It was the 27th time in the season that Plouffe won a double.
After Detroit had a confirmation run in the ninth run, Mauer pulled two beaten runs against Tigers' closeter Bruce Rondon, with a score of 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth rescue.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got out of the injury list before the game after more than a month of being out due to an infection of the lower back.
"It's obvious I didn't want a start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt I could make some nice assists in the third inning."
After Hughes took the starter to the first base, he allowed second base player Ian Kinsler to advance one step.
The right side J.D. Martinez's walk in the event of two fires led to Victor Martinez's strike, who took himself to Base 1 in the midfield and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued hitting right and causing a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he tried to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second innings and scored one fire, two-nests from runner James McCann, and two fires, one-nests from center Anthony Gose, after which the score was 3-0.
"It was an important punch," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right spot.
Hughes started to pass and fed a runless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed substitute A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six punches and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was driven away due to a strain on the shoulder of the throwing arm.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder spasm, but was due to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's record for the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was replaced by him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a strain in the right abdomen.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) plays against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi Calls for Opening the Economy to the World
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group whose task is to lead the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign finance and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group on Deepening the General Reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as pushing reforms forward adds new movement and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Board adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list limiting market access, loosening of border control principles, urging state-owned enterprises to take up private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, identifying the sectors and companies in which investment is not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legally-based business environment and makes the market more open.
The government also loosens control over the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that companies themselves decide how to run their business.
It also said that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors will be opened up to private investors to open up government-dominated sectors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for foreign permanent residents, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and support for professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement published after the meeting.
