It's not over until we're done with it.
I'll take his place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You and your sister should be better.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
There may be a problem.

It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
He definitely freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I didn't feel bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
I don't know if you're coming.
It's okay.
It doesn’t matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
Slowly I realized I misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That was on the day of our marriage, darling.
There must have been a reason for this.
It happened all of a sudden.
This happened while he was out.
It happened to me several times.

I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
There is very little chance, in my opinion, that you will be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.

I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still at home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under the influence.

It's dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.

You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
That's not the best option.
That's not the right way.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom's got a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.

It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what counts.
That could be a long time.
It could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
It needs to be washed.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.

It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock in the morning.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same song.
Environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.

It seems to me that you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's awkward to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.

You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
It's just over there.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's too late.
It's laundry today.
It's like an undersea field, and turtles, rays, and sharks above it, like flying creatures.

It's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over. It's over.
It's personal.
It's spilling like it's pouring from a bowl.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite clear that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is to discredit the working class, to relieve imperialism of the responsibility of the bloody wars it incites, and to sow the seed of the idea that the innate aggressive tendencies of man to endless wars are the causes.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's really a big deal.

This was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.
That was an under-belt punch.
It didn't matter.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It's not the first time they've done this.

That's what's gonna happen.
It'll rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
Works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
I'm having a hard time getting out of here.
That would be pointless.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
That would not be courage, it would be stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I underestimated Tom.
Yeah, okay.
I understand it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I understand what you're saying, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but I'm not touched.
I understand your problem.
I upgraded my software.
I need a job right away.
