Members of the Wales Congress are afraid to look like fools
Some MEPs have been confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The controversy began with a plan to change the name of the congress to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Council of Representatives, regardless of party stance, are concerned that the change may make them subject to mockery.
According to a Labour Party representative, the group is concerned that the name "rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to one representative of the Plaid party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has suggested other options.
A Conservative Party spokesman said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but pointed out that MWP is a short verbal leap from the word "stupid".
In the Welsh language, the letter w is pronounced in this context in the same way as the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Representative Council Commission, which is currently working on the legislative amendment necessary for the change of name, stated: 'The final decision on the titles depicting the Members of the Assembly is, of course, up to the Members themselves.'
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowers the Congress to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which there is broad support for the nomination of the delegation to the Welsh Parliament.
While the Commission favoured members of the Council of Representatives as members of the Welsh Parliament or the abbreviation WMP, the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Council of Representatives are apparently proposing alternative titles, but a lack of consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a bill for changes in a few weeks' time.
Legislation on amendments also includes other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, such as the rules on the removal of the mandate and the form of the committee system.
In legislative deliberations, Members of the Assembly may give their final vote on the title under which they should be invited.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long repeated that the name of the northern neighbour is, in practice, a territorial claim for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' clocks are silent as Harlem's churches live in difficult times
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that before there was a bar or church on every corner of the street,” says Adams.
"Today there is neither."
He said that the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, "People's relationships have changed."
“Bars are no longer neighborhood common living rooms where people gather regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not go as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they will have returned to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential buildings and apartments that are not populated by people who support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"It is impossible for more people to buy apartments in these buildings to be white," he says, "and thus they will hasten the day when these churches will close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black residential area – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original Methodist Church of Whites moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby congregation of black people acquired the building.
St. Martins was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of Harlem's central commercial street, 125th Street merchants for their opposition to recruitment or promotion.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they introduced a tower clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell game "the clocks of the poor."
An expert who played the tower-clock in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that it was the world’s first tower clock game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed into a complex bunch of architects and contractors hired by the lay leaders of the Church and by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Sakast - a governing body composed of the lay leaders of the church - wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would "aspire to roll the cost" to the Sakast, even though the Sakast had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency with regard to the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Lobster Digger in California
Authorities say the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had dive for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry out for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited about catching the lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!”
Upon reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
"I yelled at everyone to leave the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in critical condition.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's to enter the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's will challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments with expert advisers.
This is a significant move for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty industry, which will continue to grow even though sales of fashion and household goods are declining. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful they will expand to other stores next year.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets tend to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s has doubled its beauty product portfolio to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, and they will have their own brand-specific areas like boots stores.
In the future, the majority of the products will be vegan-friendly, as it will be increasingly demanded by young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop chain is testing rental stores at two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift of grocery shopping to small one-time purchases in local stores force supermarkets to invent new incentives for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as a supermarket chain struggles against low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by increasing services and non-food products.
Since buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores, as well as Habitat stores, which, according to the company, has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how the profits of supermarket pharmacies should be shared.
The new strategy follows the acquisition where Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of its pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skincare products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive environment and convenient location make us a convincing beauty shop that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
'Dragons Den' star Peter Jones left 'out of his rage' when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household goods and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She is now focusing on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "infuriated" at a tense meeting held last Tuesday at the Jones Empire business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire, and the TV star girl had admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their household goods and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and was betting it would double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of assets.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone astonished.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning is one of the UK’s most secured stars, and experts say her departure could cause the company to lose millions due to product placements that include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household items, not to mention delayed release.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Capp at Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked as M&S’ new brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Tough talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comment, which some would find inappropriate for the president, and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be the “news anchor.”
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He noted Kim’s interest in meeting again after Trump glowed the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the nuclear negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “responsive response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
He said the U.S. would continue to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
He said the efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers have been returned to their homes.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kimi.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get into this crowded hall outside with 10,000 more, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroy island, killing hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national state of emergency required by international assistance was not declared, despite the fact that about 10% of the population of Lombok had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is a traveling group to Return, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The call probably resulted in the loss of lives due to the absence of a tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in force.
Traveling between the many Indonesian islands is challenging, even under the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way to Return, but it takes at least three days before it reaches a new area of disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centrepiece of his election campaign, and he has given money to improve roads and railways.
However, Joko’s administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion, are also increasing.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought in the streets with jungle knives, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and the displacement of tens of thousands.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge tossed a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge scored a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before spooking the shot towards the rear post.
The shot floated high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Eventually the ball dropped over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as high as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and triggered without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the game in the 1-0 half after Belgium's Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass before he fled near the midfield and sprinted to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast wall pass in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a magnificent pass.
Hazard escaped from the defense and passed Liverpool with Alisson Becker's left leg in the back corner.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 pm at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 pm in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
Early Sunday, the Indonesian National Agency for Disasters said the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo, told a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
The fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Please, with a population of 380,000.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, opened a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I urge anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all taxi drivers, in particular those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police; they may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known the woman have come to the scene of the crime and asked her where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police say they are trying to inform the victim’s family about what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police said no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that it may take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeatedly said, “It’s terrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two Mayas in the isolated area, and outside there was also a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or call the Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 anonymously using code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell Statue Belongs to Historic Rewriting
The eviction of the statue would be a poetic justice, given that his own fanatical puritan supporters destroyed England’s cultural and religious relics as well as the best of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate to remove the statues would make a target for the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command and execute the English Civil War iconoclasm.
Wrong Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his forefather, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell embodies 19th-century opinions and is a historical proof of a character that many still regard as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the nineteenth century than today, see Cromwell as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, was caused by the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain, at least, is that the controversy of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation; Cromwell, in turn, is a recognizable figure representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as head of state deserve praise and remembrance.”
Killer pig kills Chinese farmer
Local media reports that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified with the last name "Yuan" was found near a pig farm at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province. The man's artery was broken and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig shepherd is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door to the nearby pighouse open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big boar with blood in his mouth.
According to the news, forensics confirmed a 250-pound boar grub killed by a farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reported that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera shows a cousin coming to the marketplace to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market managers told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid harming others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market officials are reported to be negotiating compensation for death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kilograms wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
A farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012. Following the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, or first-class hurricane, on Sunday morning from 5 East Coast Time, and it was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical humidity northwards toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will form large areas of rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Local rainfall of 25 to 100 millimetres causes dangerous heavy rainfall floods and potentially landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of 50-75 millimeters per hour in certain deposition areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the southwest, especially Arizona, are expected to receive as much as 50-100 millimeters of rain.
Severe flooding is possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the dispersal of tropical rain.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure zone brings local heavy rainfall to southern California’s coastal areas.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimetres is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Scattered tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, we can see strong fluctuations in temperatures throughout the United States as the Arctic cools down, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
In the central United States, we see an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa’s Des Moines is almost 20 degrees.
The stagnant heat of the summer tends to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can reach +26<0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, about 4<0xC2><0xB0>C warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, there are good prospects for higher than average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched a television broadcast on Tuesday by six TV channels where Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, gave their intriguing testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as the broadcasters interrupted their broadcasts at the last minute turn, according to which the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations on the basis of a deal arranged by Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona.
Ford told the Senate Legal Affairs Committee that he was 100 percent sure that the drunken Kavanaugh had touched him and tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony stating that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
There were probably more spectators than Nielsen’s 20.4 million on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewer rating on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure the viewers who watch in offices.
Some of the proportions indicate that the number corresponds to the number of spectators of the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest number of viewers of all broadcasters, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day of the hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed how protesters' screams led him to the elevator on Friday on the way to a hearing with the Legal Affairs Committee, a moderate Republican who had previously announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed him standing for minutes with his eyes down as the reproaches flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told.
Mr Flake said that his office had made a statement and, before the lift doors were closed, added that he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting on the Kavanaugh appointment to be put to the vote in the Senate Plenary.
Flake said he only acted in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against him next week, as demanded by minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses those who criticize her plans to leave the EU of politics that threatens Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan, calling the proposal that Britain and the EU should impose import duties on each other "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested him for shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at the LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, he is accused of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of a confrontation between Simpson and Sims, in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB said.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during interrogation.
His bail was set at <0x24>350,000, according to Advocate magazine.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement authorities for their “seriousness and justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where Wayne's father played basketball in the LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "terrified" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening," Wayde said.
A volcano spitting ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico’s Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center recorded the thunder and vibration several times.
Social media posted photos of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash in residential areas like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists meet before independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police, with thousands participating in rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split vote.
Police detained a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, forming dark clouds of dust on the streets normally filled by tourists.
Over the course of the day, more riots broke out as police officers used their batons to curb the raids.
The clashes between the independents and the unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter shouting "Long live Spain".
The local press said 14 people had been treated for minor injuries during demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in the pro-independence region a year after the 1 October referendum, which is declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although participation was low when those against boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block voting in polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent the night outside Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration was held, but it had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for Catalonia’s independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives."
“I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the narrow but vital victory of last December’s regional elections, the momentum of Catalonia’s independent parties has faded this year, and many of the most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a police-promoting demonstration on her phone, said politicians on both sides were fueling the controversy.
"The situation is getting tighter," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who has been in custody for nine years, announced that he will participate in next year's European elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was reported to have repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
Events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. UK time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
The car may have been shot with a crossbow at some point.
Livingston defeated Rangers 1-0 with Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured victory
Livingston stunned the Rangers and only defeated Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox manager.
Dolly Menga's goal was eventually enough to win as Gary Holt's team ascended to a shared second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team lost their first away win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday faces Head of Division Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued to lose six games in the league, and Holt hasn’t lost a single game since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places in response to a visitor suffering from a shortage of blades
Holt's team should have led long before his goal, having caused the Rangers a lot of trouble with their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide. Next Alan Lithgow slipped to Craig Halkett's butt but passed the ball.
The hosts willingly handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate for special situations.
This is how the important goal came about.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, whereupon Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, from where he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found the home team held the defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly allowed to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt, and Lithgow passed the ball from one more Livingston special situation.
The centers that rained down in Livingston's penalty area were continually cleaned up, and two situations demanded an unnecessary penalty shot - a smashed substitute Glenn Middleton and a smashed ball.
"Excellent performance from Livingston - analysis
the BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the upward leads.
The way the team plays and the crew has hardly changed since it has returned to the highest league level.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was astonished to lead an excellently organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers were lacking in ideas.
The team has at times performed very well under Gerrard, but is now far from his standard.
The last assist was exhausted, and they managed to unlock the home team's defense only once, which should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the middle of the chart.
Erdogan received a varied reception in Cologne.
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and freedom of the press, as well as on Turkey’s EU aspirations.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but many supporters still gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him into the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect a division of opinion, and some German Turks greet him as a hero, while others slander him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10 a.m. local time in southwest Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The driver stopped and the nursing staff came to help the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Unrest
Prison officials report that six prison guards were injured in the high-class male prison disturbances.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continues.
Tornado special police have been brought in to calm the unrest, behind which eight prisoners are in one prison wing.
Minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent to HMP Long Lartin to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
He was reportedly hospitalized in June after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October, riot police were alerted to the prison because of serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings a threat of heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but this is exactly what is happening at the beginning of next week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern desert with the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of heavy rainfall during Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern Kaifonia and Utah, as well as cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest modelling by the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall of 50 to 100 millimeters, while the Mogollin ridge in Arizona can precipitate up to 150 millimeters.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, it can be estimated that between 25 and 50 milliliters can be produced, and in some places it can rain as much as 100 millimetres.
Rosa rain can also be a blessing in drought-affected areas if there is no risk of heavy flooding.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rains may be useful because of severe droughts in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Administration, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first lands on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, at a speed of 135 kilometers per hour and moving northward at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when faced with cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to northwest Sonora, 75-150 millimetres are expected, and up to 250 millimetres are possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey across Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday mornings, from where she continues her journey across Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday evening..
"The biggest risks of Rosa or its remains would be associated with very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the Southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Agency said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfall and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. UK time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in a “stable” condition.
Police said they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking to be contacted by anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh's Experienced Democratic Party Has 'Evil and Anger'
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the “malice and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford, which would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified to his accusations at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans had seen Kavanaugh’s excellence, character and courage on that day.
"My vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with excellent merits in public service," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full-on," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had taken on the role of “resistance and obstruction.”
A senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination process is expected in the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Authorities said Saturday at least 384 people died after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, many of whom were wiped out by the giant waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the festival on the shore of the city on Friday, when waves as high as six metres hit the shore in the twilight, and many were washed to death while the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still at the beach and did not immediately escape, leaving them as victims,” said Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses and hit all over the land," Nugroho says. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 km/h on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial images published by the Disaster Bureau show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian agency for technology evaluation and application (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have caused a tsunami.
Nugroho described the devastation as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and the damage could be greater on the 300 kilometers north of Palu coast, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
Communications are "completely cut off and no information has been received from Donggala," Nugroho says.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to say the tsunami hit Return, although authorities said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building is shouting fervently warnings about an imminent tsunami for people on the street.
Just minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that cut the communication lines around Please, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Authorities say the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport aircraft, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport has been reopened for aid purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Please evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision’s staff at Donggala have been brought to safety in the city of Please, where they have been accommodated in the tent roofs in the office’s courtyard. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
When the relief teams began their desolating mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Return.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start flowing once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.”
When the second night landed on Please after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people kept hoping that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Hitchhiking Team, had trained two missing Hitchhikers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, according to Mandagi.
"As a senior member of the federation, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he desperately tried to reach out to the beach festival participants with Please Competitors WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hanging federation community.
However, only one gray marker appeared after the messages he sent, instead of two blue ones.
"That means, I understand, that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves Steal <0x24>26,750 in ATM Replenishment at Newport on the Wide
The thieves took <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's security worker on Friday morning while he was completing an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver had been clearing and replenishing the ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee was distracted, "my husband ran behind him," who stole the money, too.
Witnesses said they saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identities are requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The character formerly known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the nickname of the 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the show, cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him, in addition to being an abbreviation for his professional name.
While discussing the title of the album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it means "you."
“I am you, me, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye - which only expresses the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced that he prefers Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner JAY-Z has also occasionally removed and returned the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO Promises Not to Use Military Against Civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of student retaliation.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, said he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
The armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
Joint institutions should double funding for AI research
The U.S. should double its funding for AI research as China intensifies its operations in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financer and AI professional who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence from various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: to become the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Double the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee’s book, “The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most significant AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the top-ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and as head of Google's China operations.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have worked hard to get public funding.
"Academic influencers are not exported by China, but by large corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think that doctoral students in artificial intelligence should be automatically issued green cards," he said.
The Government of China’s next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations grant funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industrial and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the bill to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing the country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to the 'Republic of North Macedonia', which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's aspirations to join the European Union and NATO.
In the view of Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on a new name proposal, but anti-nationalists believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the required 50 % turnout will be reached in order for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price so that Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can apply for both EU and NATO membership. .
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of this House have said that they respect the result of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents erected to boycott the referendum in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads upright, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, like China and Russia, as part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of the name change because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said "yes" is "the way we see our future."
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies indicated a turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - that is, below the required level of activity.
In a second survey commissioned by Macedonia’s Telma TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote for the “yes” option.
For a referendum to be successful, voter turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats Brighton with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal at 65 minutes seem ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the game, the Argentinian leader scored a pass from the middle.
He found an empty space in the field by running through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used his first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot oriented to the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his legs."
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
Yes, it did.
Fortunately, he scored in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the azure an advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero scored a ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touchings before sending the ball to the backpost towards Sterling.
The sky-blue attacker threw the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in a game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why force them into the starting line-up?
However, Scherzer is always equally competitive and hopes to take possession of the pit stop in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have one win difference in the Los Angeles Dodgers western league.
The Rockies took at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still aiming for their first division win.
“While we don’t have the stakes, we can at least climb the pass-hill knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team here in Denver will create for me the most demanding racing situation I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I accept the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a rehearsal on Thursday, playing at the start of his 34th game, and then relaying on Sunday with his normal resting time.
The right-handed player in Washington has an 18-7 win/loss ratio in this season. The ERA stats are 2.53 and he has burned the batter to the base 300 times, with the innings stats being 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president implicitly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, while at the same time speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“All our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lifetime.
This is one of the big things -- not just campaigning, campaigning full, and that's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump said: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't choose who they want to hurt or who they have to crush to gain power. That's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of "resistance and obstruction".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrathful and mean and malicious and false."
Referring to Dianne Feinstein, the longest influential Democratic senator on the Senate Justice Committee, the audience responded with loud boo-boo.
“Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, uh, no, I'll wait a little -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinion.
I was not really surprised when my local Momentum activists supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I am only the latest Labour representative in the queue to be told that I am not welcome - just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way just because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar topics, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Summit said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour representative, Fridays in the party council have been just that.
Now, many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and the policy of 'friendlier and gentler' has long since been forgotten, if ever it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is appropriate for the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a wave of insults on social media, calling for my choice to be withdrawn, for the rejection of centrist politics, and for me to be told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my own experience.
I know indeed that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members, because the comments made to me are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults on a daily basis and never waver.
The normalisation of abuse is one of the most disturbing aspects of politics in this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the rule of election, the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything goes well.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, as a result of the Thatcher Government's negligence in the Single School, I have sought, both as a city councillor and as a minister, to promote better public services for those most in need.
I have never hidden my political stance, not even in the last elections.
No one in the electoral district of Nottingham East could have been surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current management.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that is hampering households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from doing what I think is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr in the blockhead
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a day's victory in the entertaining Tennant's Premiership game.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of 10 that has not lost a single game.
A brilliant defense and more successful risk-taking was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be pleased with it for good reason.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still invincible, so I can be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "With all the credit to Ayr, they took the risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead in 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Clima's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, which the Warriors handed over to the match, allowed Melrose to climb, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before half-time he scored a goal and succeeded in a conversion kick, raising Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, in which Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points in a conversion kick.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and removed from the pitch. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo scored a conversion kick.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal that failed to convert.
The home team, however, responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Clima, and Macpherson scored a goal behind Ayr, who had left the sideline.
Climo did the same conversion kick as before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and had Gregor Henry finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game star starts in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actress portrays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is listed as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.
'The sea belongs to us': landlocked Bolivia tries to reconnect with the Pacific Ocean by legal means
Sailors patrolling outside the naval base in La Paz.
On the flagpoles of public buildings there is a sea-blue flag.
Navy bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are thrust with the slogan: "Just the sea belongs to us.
Getting it back is our duty.”
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody war on resources of the 19th century is still strong – as is the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
The hope is at its highest in decades, with Bolivia awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong faith in progress, a common spirit and serenity and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are optimistic about the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that at the end of decades of intermittent debate in The Hague, Bolivia’s position on Chile’s obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea will be upheld.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle over re-election next year, has a lot at stake in next Monday’s lineup.
"Return to the Pacific is very close," he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s best interests, and even if it did, the situation would hardly change.
A UN institution of Dutch origin has no competence to extradite Chilean jurisdictions, and the ICJ has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is issued just six months after the last statements were made suggests that the case “is not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the past four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia’s intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the question of sea connection," Zárate said.
The rhetoric challenging the Morales controversy has stifled the rest of the Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold the negotiations thereafter.
Neither country has had an embassy since 1962.
The former president and Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not agree with the view that the court’s decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday will give Bolivia an “exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and an opportunity “to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to connect with the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that it’s time for us to move forward from the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
"North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington," North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore summit.
Ri’s statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume a deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was “a distant dream” to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the Korean War ended would bring North Korea to its knees.
Until Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is on guard in adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up its arsenal, which the state probably sees as the only real means of guaranteeing its own security, has come under widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows showcase the latest collection of large headgear that will soon be on your street as well
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don’t have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of unusual oversized headgear at their SS19 showcase that dazzled the styles of the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical headgear captured Instagram this summer, and these designers have also posted their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather blade that covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon with jewellery stones, a wizard hat and even a pineapple —but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a range of strange masks – just before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn their lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high-end fashion.
One creature with a snorkel and mask resembled a diving device, and another resembled a melted cone of ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand on big-sized fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves will appear on the streets.
Exaggerated-sized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-metre cylinder that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult fame of the impractical hat, which was widely seen on social media, also wings another large creation into the fashion shows – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that wears it.
The raffia bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for the world citizen
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good exam results. The success has been strengthened by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by SCIS, the Scottish Council of Private Schools, aim to provide a high level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for careers of their choice, postgraduate and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an educational actor who can design and implement tailor-made learning content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject to continue in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message will go to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships with people in other countries with confidence.
This year’s latest test results show that languages are at the top of the list in terms of passing rates among private schools.
Sixty-eight per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved the highest A score.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools and found that 72% of the students with the highest A score studied Mandarin, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey commissioned by the UK Employment Agency found that 17% of situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for possible work tasks, the more relevant these skills are in the global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he will have an advantage over this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of the career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent of more than 4,000 British adults are unable to communicate in a foreign language, and French was the only two-digit language spoken by 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Especially knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find meaningful careers.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialised teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed in whatever the future holds.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, versatility and high-level youth in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of SCIS, Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron to make his debut in San Diego on Sunday
The fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first appearance at the Los Angeles Lakers are almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday for a pre-season game.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," Walton Lakers' official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play the incomplete minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six games before the season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any more pre-matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five elections scheduled for next week, including sympathetic destinations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his election to fill the vacant seat of a Supreme Court judge, Trump will seek to increase support for the forthcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing a majority in Congress in the November elections.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 7 p.m. on the East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign event online live on YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to comment on this week’s hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became adamant over sexual harassment charges that have delayed the Senate’s confirmation vote for as long as a week as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary objective of the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
Accordingly, comments on President Trump’s campaign were made on these five events next week to “awaken volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Governing Congress is so essential to his purposes that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign period,” Trump’s anonymous spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and fans can even arrive from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media outlets from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Will to Keep Hope Before Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon doubles were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where, according to them, is this success at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead, which narrowed to four, so we take this success power as a hippie," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind on the sails and a lot to be encouraged by, like the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play together all day and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior brick to green, and leads by example.
The victorious throat tones intensified as his lap progressed, as he managed in a critical putt to equalize the match to exactly four, while he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt that they won the 15th game was followed by a similar shout that gave the impression that he believed that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and only take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but sweet duo has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo who didn't do any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this bustling crowd, confirms that they are Sunday’s favorites, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to ensure Europe’s eventual victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning’s doubles.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede so deep that they were not even close to getting out of there.
However, on Sunday, no one will help you out of the pit.
Four-ball and four-player games are fascinating to watch closely from a couple’s perspective: what kind of advice they give or don’t give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, taking a remarkable lead before the last day, but this quadruple game proved that the US team has a fighting spirit, even though it has been suspected, especially in the US.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is well ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup since they took a 10-6 lead from the United States in Saturday's four-ball and four-player games.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the march with two victories over the rapping Tiger Woods, and scored a high score of four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who made a great effort to maintain a loss at Hazeltine two years ago, controlled the poorly played US team in the morning's four-ball, taking the match to a 3-1 position.
The United States was a tougher opponent in the quads, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow their lead.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep winning.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively called "Molliwood", were the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they then finished the supremely discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with even more vigorous 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through two matches on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-player, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested on the morning's four-balls, but returned to the doubles with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time value winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the U.S. with two points on Saturday.
They secured a 2-to-1 victory over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball game, and later a 4-to-3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-ball game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team risen from a four-point chase to level at the start of the doubles, although on Furyk's side, a draw is enough to keep the win.
After two days of being second best, however, it may be that Sunday’s counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea 'no way' disarms itself without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken "significantly benevolent measures" over the past year, including ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the test site, and pledging that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the preservation of national security, so in such circumstances, disarming ourselves unilaterally is not possible.”
While Ri reiterated the familiar lamentation that Washington would not accept a phased denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate point, his statement is significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President-in-Office and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in a statement, Kim assured "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to officially end the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States demands ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even against a ‘declaration of peace’,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a dream of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself underlined to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, he stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party calling for disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have come to such a dead end.”
Yet Ri’s tone was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that missiles aimed at the U.S. mainland were unavoidable after “bad President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” with suicidal intentions.
Last year, Trump threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea. However, this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage to approach the disarmament, but stressed that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea drops its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia urged the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strong and unsuccessful until we prove a complete, definitive and reinforced denuclearisation.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting the funding channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with the North Korean Rin in the margins of the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit did not go smoothly.
While leaving Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event that the U.S. takes “similar measures.”
According to Pompeo, by “equivalent measures” Kim means the security guarantees Trump pledged at the Singapore summit and the move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Adequate Rest Instruction Course
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University will take part in a course designed to increase students’ rest. This course is a counter-attack to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basic issues related to their own well-being.
Designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the course is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why do I hear about it only now, in my final year of school?'
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which was surprising to me," he said in an interview with the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medicine at Harvard University and deputy director of health services at the university, says the university ended up organizing the course after hearing how students suffered from severe sleep deficiencies during the week of study.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive assignments.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thereby gaining information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep deficiency on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behavior.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know about these things in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a subject of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
“Getting adequate and high-quality sleep should be the students’ ‘secret weapon’ against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state in the brain that is similar to starvation, which is why people are constantly hungry,” the professor notes.
Raymond So, a Californian 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave an impetus to the organisation of a comprehensive course for all students on the campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students could complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock to remind them of their bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning, and to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic displays and LED lighting "blue light" on the circadian rhythm, which can make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot defeated Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had yet another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox's players were claiming their first win since the February 4-1 game against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard was only a second loss in his career as a manager of 18 games. The Rangers were eight points away from the current Premier League leader, the Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' defeated will no longer equalized the situation.
As a result of the game, the Rangers fell to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, with only Hibernian above.
The Rangers may face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object was thrown from the guest hall and had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight shifts to the line-up where the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the Scottish League Cup semifinals.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up, which took a point from the Hearts last week. The same strategy again yielded results, as a well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score in just two minutes, when Menga's first assist gave Scott Pittman a free pass to Allan McGregor's goal.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the other defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide into the rear post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the last third of the game, there was no self-confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty after fifteen minutes of collision between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was able to defeat Lassana Coulibaly's butt and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston’s goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn’t just because of the team’s hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long pass tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly sent the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the pitch. The change almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly's impressive rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued to make long passes after each other.
Holt's team had a chance to raise their lead in the last moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense blocked Jacobs's intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers replacement, also demanded a penalty kick after confronting Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geiger meter inventor
On September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany on this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the metric was also a key concept in pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "The Clocks of Coronado" is well suited, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portray some seemingly cowboy scientists:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger gauge. It's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really raging now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
In this method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of many cancers
The dog vaccine has yielded promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method is to isolate resistant cells from the patient and modify them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers, and then inject the modified cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “Our findings suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer, as well as cancers of the ovaries, lungs, and colon."
A similar approach —to take resistant cells from the patient and teach them how to attack cancer cells— has also produced results in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was caught in the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West received a buoyancy on Saturday Night Live after he hailed President Donald Trump and announced that he was running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing tonight's third song "Ghost Town" in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often, when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
“If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch where Matt Damon taunted Brett Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, linked to allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's slogan was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock posted a snippet of it on social media.
It's unclear if Rock's intention is to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been mistreated for wearing a hat in the backstage.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told not to go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they’ll say I’m in the margins,” West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says he's wearing his Superman cape because, "then you can't control what I do.
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments made the audience buoya at least twice, and the performers of the show looked embarrassed. One of the attendees described the situation to the newspaper as "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was shortly selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who praised her courage on Twitter: "Thank you for threatening the junk."
Speaker Karen Hunter tweeted that West “is just himself, which is absolutely wonderful.”
However, I can choose to BE SUPPORTED by a person (by buying their music or clothing brand or by supporting their “art”), which I believe supports and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
The rapper later tweeted that he had changed his name to “a person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the deceased musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabber charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident occurred in the Ballyhackakomore area.
The defendant is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Star of the throne game Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for her sword-waving heroic role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent fantasy series Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero stereotype: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” in the case, questioning the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the <0x23>MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, married to Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old star of the Game of Thrones, admits he has a strong desire to intervene.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity awakens strong feelings in me right now,” she says.
"What has men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to the problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters appearing on it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
There is something very wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the prequels or sequels to the Throne Game after the series ends next summer because, according to his own words, he "has had enough of battlefields and horses."
In November, Harrington will be featured in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his brother who robbed him.
The actress recently revealed that getting to know her future wife Rose was the best thing the Game of Thrones has offered her.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow's Harrington character in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family’s property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections in China increased by 14%
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
Health officials say the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The overwhelming majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which represents a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are caused by inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies an employee leaked information from a Republican senator and accuses him of spreading “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied allegations on Saturday that her employee had posted personal information about the three Republican senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic MP said the allegations were spread by "extreme-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement.
The information included the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person published the information on Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a Senate Committee hearing on charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that, according to the Hillin newspaper, the messages were published from an IP address associated with the Waters office and by a person on the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security has been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is not in any way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character does not fit a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, there is no reason for him to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be defiant.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
We need to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters' seat in the midterm congressional election, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
“I can’t believe this is true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies in response to these fraudulent accusations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he added, "and that they are legally held responsible for all destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English strikes again as Rowan Atkinson's agent parody
There is a long-established tradition of searching for Brexit references in any film that is even slightly inclined towards the UK, but this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and came back to life with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English - Reborn".
Can the nation’s satire on the cheek become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, the cheek-eyed, cumin-faced and incompetent Johnny English has already earned his permission to screw up for the second time, and his name above all tells us that it is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
This is, of course, the silly secret agent who desperately tries to breathe the glamour around him, but appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and that unfortunate one-note musician at the opening concert in London in 2012.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical man of the world, who was left behind in chaos, as Atkinson originally portrayed in Barclaycard’s television commercials.
The latest show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems subdued and oddly unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ movie brands like 007 and Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English’s insane treatment doesn’t seem to me as inventive and sharp-eyed as Atkinson’s Mr. Bean’s silent comedy.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that Britain is in trouble for the worse.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a top-secret spy network in the UK and reveals the identities of all British agents on the ground to the astonishment of an agent on duty – presented as an unfortunately small performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a pompous and struggling prime minister who is already in the swamp of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in the skins of Teresa May, but the script just doesn’t give her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been discovered, someone who has already left active service must be called in.
Of course, this is a stunning Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a fine school teacher, but at the same time he gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject fills with some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-like lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets his endlessly patient battle partner, Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, who in the role of Vicki Pepperdine seems not to get his rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of His Majesty to face the fateful super-villain Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough immediately turns into a farce: a duo disguised as waitresses sets fire to a fancy French restaurant and causes chaos in their secret quest for Volta’s luxury yacht. The attempt to explore Volta’s house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last blocks of the authors fall when the final scene arrives, but despite all the power and charm, the film still feels a bit made for a children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching Johnny English films, I’ve come to the same conclusion before: why is the British film industry not able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour rejects plans for four-day work week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party is said to require business leaders to pass on to the workers the savings generated by the AI revolution in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends with the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would 'suit' to the party's economic program and its plans for tilting the policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to the four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “The announcement of the revision of the route is expected before the end of the year.
Change is not instantaneous, but the four-day working week is a goal that fits into the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the UK’s Green Party pledged to support the transition to a four-day working week in its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective will not receive indivisible support in the Labour ranks.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy, and the party is not considering switching to one.”
John McDonnell, Treasury Secretary of the Shadow Government, took advantage of last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "faceless dictators" and "speculators" of non-profit corporations.
According to the plans of the Treasury Minister of the Shadow Government, the current shareholders of the water companies would not get their shares back in full, as the Labour-led government could implement “deductions” on the basis of the observed abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employee management, with a maximum annual payout of <0xC2><0xA3>500 per employee in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh’s appointment.
In a Sunday episode of the 60 Minutes program, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it was possible for the FBI to find out things that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said on my way to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the accusations came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to have been hewn into stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he nominated could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which will be held in New York on Saturday, is a music event with performers as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to the lawns of Central Park in New York City to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the real goal of the event known: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group whose goal is to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must perform various tasks or “deeds”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or making a phone call, or performing any other act that raises awareness of the goals of the project.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that it has only 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others – the idea that you can change the world by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has reported over 19 million "deeds" since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policymakers to declare commitments and principles equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which have been spent in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than <0x24>10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds so far have affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to “helping children develop to their full potential”. The group committed to deliver <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country. This was after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
“Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and the world’s citizens just like you, we are able to pass social injustice and malnutrition to the journals of history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also called on the British government to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on combating malnutrition and reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the movement’s website is: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen’s response: “The road will be long and difficult and there will be many stumbling blocks in front of us.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the New York Concert this year, and its starring cast includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it could hamper energy exports by using the Navy as an “obstacle”
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinken, quoted by the Washington Examiner, said Washington could "rely on" its Navy to prevent the spread of Russian energy to the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s actions in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse to explore new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia's] reason for the presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open by using its fleet and, if necessary, by blocking it, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the global market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the public at the event, organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group profiled as the "speaker of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued comparing Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it was the same thing.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, describing Russia as a "one-trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements take place at a time when the Trump administration has sought to increase the efficiency of LNG exports to Europe and replace the much cheaper Russian LNG.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of the existing pipeline of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s opposition is purely economic, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States’ attitude has prompted a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Industrial Confederation, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Confederation, said in a statement following a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully about "candidating for presidential elections in 2020"
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" about running for president after the midterm election.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination for an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed administration, and that includes a woman at the top of the empire,” he said.
"After the sixth of November, I will carefully consider running for president."
Warren judged President Donald Trump during the event, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticisms of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, a majority of Warren’s electorate is not in favour of this candidacy in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk University Department of Political Studies and the Boston Globe, 58% of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts are not in favor of a senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of standing.
A majority of respondents were in favour of Deval Patrick’s candidacy with 38%, while 48% were against the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has announced that he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin Refers to Her Son's War Trauma at Donald Trump Election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my son is going through when he gets home, I can well identify with other families that are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our returning soldiers are going through,” he told an audience gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for Donald Trump’s election ceremony.
Palin called the arrest "a streamer in the living room" and said that his son, like other war veterans, "will return home slightly changed, they will return hardened, they will return wondering if there is any respect for what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett said he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun intoxicated.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are appealing a new policy in force in the United States that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and federal districts have filed a letter from Justice Friends in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who violate the policy, NBC News reports.
The defendant’s full name has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He says he was assaulted by his partner "and his sons in a violent gang" and was denied asylum by U.S. authorities on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where most of the asylum seekers in the United States come from, as countries where gang and domestic violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new asylum policy of the United States overturned the 2014 decision of the Asylum Appeals Board that undocumented migrants were allowed to apply for asylum on the grounds of domestic violence.
The Columbia District Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international law for decades."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle.”
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practice of blocking asylum seekers from entering is damaging to the U.S. economy, as newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and “bring the necessary additional workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"The asylum is intended for people who flee their home country because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social affiliation or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even the serious ones— that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts for survivors continue in Palu – the number of found dead has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calms down her febrile baby at the Please evacuation centre in the ruined city.
Ambulances bring in new bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their wetted belongings, and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Please Army Hospital, where patients are treated for constant, strong aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how a violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then it was quiet.
I don’t know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "provoking" by "propaganda announcements"
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper as a means of propaganda, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid appendix to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the congressional elections on 6 November.
Trump’s allegations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in the US election mark a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-escalating trade war in which both sides in turn impose tariffs on the counterparty’s exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, at the beginning of the trade war, Chinese revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. workers, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in a poll published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the prestigious U.S. free speech and press traditions by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, the dissenting opinions in the newspaper kiosks in the streets of Beijing are only limited, and the real, dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that “one of the largest newspapers in China withdrew an offer to publish” the article he wrote, but does not specify what newspaper it is about.
Kavanaugh Fiasco Expels Female Voters From Republicans, Analysts Warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names stand behind Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and defend him may cause a reaction, according to analysts, especially among female voters in the forthcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding the case have been in big circles, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move forward in the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona)’s last-minute offer for an FBI investigation to appeasingly angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokeswoman for MoveOn, a national reform group, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming” as they protested in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans of the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, which happened despite a testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among suburban insecure female voters and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts anticipate a possible reaction if the Republicans proceed with the confirmation even before Ford’s testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his allegations of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will be put to question. It’s about how the Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, head of the Democratic Priorities USA group, said in a statement.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new survey conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony absolutely or most likely, while 35% say they believe in Kavanaugh absolutely or most likely.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushed the case forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the jury that Kavanaugh abused him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate revealed his genitals to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet as a counterattack to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to what information.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt’s goal is “to rule the world.”
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data repository” or POD.
It can include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what kind of data.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through information.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-acquired security platform, a community of hired developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website. All this will be available from this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether or not people should be offered a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for their consent.”
In a paper published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the coherence and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city commemorates the heroic priest of World War I
The city celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Victoria Cross award given to the Church of England as the only priest to serve as a soldier.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Reverend Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, following the attacks on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Vann died, however, four days later, without ever learning of the highest British military honor he had received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is “strongly symbolic”; the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather’s exploits.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line and "with the greatest bravery" led the advance of the troops before attacking the field cannons alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s action was “something I could never match, something that inspires respect.”
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr James Vann, laid a wreath after a parade with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is “a great honor to take part in the parade” and added, “a great number of people are there to commemorate the glory of a true hero.”
Fans of the freestyle game waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve been up all night watching the anticipated Bellator 206 tournament and the whole event isn’t being played.
The event, which was scheduled to be held in San Jose, consisted of 13 matches, of which six matches in the main series, and was to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show changed to Pipsa Possu for the great astonishment of the audience.
Some of the spectators weren’t really happy to stay up all night because of the game.
A friend of the free-match opened up on Twitter describing replacing the match with a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, such content was not suitable for presentation at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch it to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, explaining the switching of the program.
"Piss Pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said schedules will be worked on to allow UK viewers to follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a retransmission that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning, and we can’t get the program out until Sunday, which is their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, the messages began to go one way and the other, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is a disturbing situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels inferior to himself because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he had not noticed until coming to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, Daley said he talked about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also tells us that after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, the regular host of a long-term radio program, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was young, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work."
He says, “To this day, these feelings of feeling less and different have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I need to succeed.”
She says she wanted to prove she was ‘something’ so she wouldn’t disappoint everyone when her sexuality was finally revealed.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and will appear at this year’s Commonwealth Games appealing for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells the story of her love for Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker she met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things at such a young age” – she attended her first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later – “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same kind of prosperity and adversity,” Daley says.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father would never approve of him dying, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about tickets to the 2012 Olympics, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there to be in the front row anymore," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. It was only when her breathing really stopped and she was dead that I finally realized that she was not invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also the inspiration for his first choice of songs on the air – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which aroused emotions even as he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still makes his skin go chicken.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Mickelson half-qualified for exchange seat at Saturday's Ryder Cup
US Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to make a significant effort to avoid the record-breaking lap in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays for the record 12th time in a two-yearly event, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-some on Saturday.
Usually the American five-time Major winner spent half the day as a cheerleader and half the day on the pitch trying to get his punch under control.
48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field where a tall, rugged punch punishes inaccurate punches.
If there is not enough resistance for Mickelson on the pitch, the ninth game on Sunday will be faced by British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in 12 singles, get a flying start, Michelson’s game may prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else can be said about the situation.
"He fully understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, squeezed and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined otherwise, but this is how it went, and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be there as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for several Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, albeit, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but according to Furyk, his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's clever, he likes to joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy that everyone likes to be with," she explains.
"The younger players must have had a lot of fun with him this week, too.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leadership position can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup’s massive leadership before the final day of the doubles can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but he managed to win with just his nose and win with the narrowest possible margin141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds us of how we led in Valderrama, how we led in Brookline, where we lost, but won in Valderrama, albeit scarcely,” said Bjorn after looking at the 2018 team’s 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
“History will show me and all the rest of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and that is all we are aiming at.
As I’ve always said, I’m focusing on these 12 players who are on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted to see how his team’s players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I never lick until I drop in things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, the priority will be individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, your ability is tested to the bottom.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform best.
Now we have to give up the partner who is allowed to go [to the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require players to perform better individually than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day's full turns in both directions. He was part of the Brookline winning team before becoming a loser when the European team won "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team stretched out his team's ranks to the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to have a quick start just like it happened in Brookline, or like it happened in Medinah.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our line-up accordingly and we’ll put the boys on the pitch the way we want, as you know, we’re going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas is given the task of trying to lead the defense battle and faces Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in line to face their European opponents.
"I put my teammates in this order because I think it's going to carry the whole tournament," Bjorn said.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace obsolete Cold War equipment, but it will not be commissioned until next year due to faulty systems and explosively rising costs, local media reports.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, the commissioning of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the ambitious project has been haunted by worrying after-sales problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels commissioned by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to the available information, they will be equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems for combating aircraft and surface vessels, and masking technologies such as radar reflection and infrared and acoustic signal reduction technologies.
Another important feature of the ship is its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting their home port.
Continued delays mean, however, that warships at the forefront of technology – allegedly designed to enhance Germany’s influence in overseas territories – are already outdated when they take up service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has talked about essential "software and hardware failures" that make a warship unfit for combat missions.
Software shortcomings are particularly important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class of vessels is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to carry out subsequent upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, which has a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, is estimated to be twice as heavy as the German ships used in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag of the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering sum of EUR 3.1 billion, compared to the initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of accessing new frigates have emerged as the German navy has recently been warned of a shrinking power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out that the fleet's vessels "are running out of usable vessels".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been decommissioned but not replaced by new ones.
He complained that no frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to enter the fleet.
Environmental organizations eavesdrop on the secret lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation measures.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland have conducted a study of mink and dwarf bats, as well as earbuds and water wings in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special recording devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organization’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the noises and the species concerned are confirmed by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is created, in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats, and how they are exploited by different species.
The data will help in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking account of bats and related species.
The bat populations of Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threaten the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo tracking technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization dedicated to the protection of the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, rest checks and, in some cases, animal rescues.
The organization has even established the first and only protected area in Scotland dedicated exclusively to the protection of bats on the lands of Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway areas, with eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
According to farm manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very suitable for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before starting renovation work, since the destruction of one bat resting place can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is forbidden to kill, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Flea Conservation Organisation, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "false news" and says people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 at a hotel in Las Vegas.
He is said to have paid the victim <0x24>375,000 to remain silent, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer sharply denied the allegations and described them as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that they have called “unsubstantiated reporting of privacy concerns,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player is claiming compensation for “mental suffering according to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious personal rights violation in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met in a nightclub and moved into a player’s room where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99% a good guy," but whose "1%" disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later reached a compromise because he was "terrified of the possibility of revenge" and worried about being "subjected to public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking the abolition of the mediation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to signing a deal to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United and moved to Juventus for a <0x24>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain "should regret forever" car manufacturing ends
Britain would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Economic Affairs Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "worrying" about Toyota's announcement to temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says the effects of border delays will be reflected in job losses if Brexit comes without a deal.
The plant in Burnaston, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production interruptions at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota’s Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its factory for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern concerns supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a timely JOT-principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and the cars are manufactured on-demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It is impossible to maintain a warehouse at the Derbyshire plant for more than 24 hours, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May’s EU relations plan is “precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.”
"We want the best possible deal, which is not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"The statements not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the supply chains that have worked very well so far."
Toyota does not know how long production will be halted, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union administrator at the factory, says that concerns are growing among members: “In my experience, jobs lost will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may have to be postponed for another week because of the 'duty' around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s interference in the election, Trump’s associates’ connections with Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump intends to dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardize the impartiality of Mueller’s investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of dismissal of the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein's visit to the White House last Monday was reportedly due to Rosenstein's resignation.
At the time, however, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would not “preferably” dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News’ Sunday program.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "There's no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court right now.
We'll see, but I want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the shortage of press conferences was for reasons other than disgust with the "attractiveness" of TV journalists, but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questioning hours than any president before him," he says, adding more evidence without quoting: "We've checked those numbers."
"Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, "but it is infinitely better for the media to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you’ve seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Being alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President has perhaps pointed out the reason for this by appearing uninhibited and occasionally strangely to journalists who have gathered.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) from EU countries about their fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish health system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter after less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made provision to cover the costs of applications for "established status" for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal resignation.
I know for all of you these are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each and every one of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery for head injury
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injuries occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side line before putting him on a stretcher and taking him aside for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State trustee told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/size of the injury at this stage," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays her first season in the team after her transfer from Illinois.
He had five hits on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 hits this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The amendment aims to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
Increasing stamp duty for those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when buying real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to taxing high-income people.
The increase in the stamp tax will be directed at people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be channelled to government efforts to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee – which will be added to the current stamp tax in addition to the increases in second- and investment dwellings added two years ago – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to reach <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
An estimated 13% of London’s new buildings are bought by non-residents in the UK, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to buy in the property market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering stamp duty as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon low-cost housing quotas to remedy Britain’s “disgraceful housing situation.”
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and an end to “confidential evictions.”
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
"I said last year that I was going to devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream that every generation should have a better life than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents do.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far too distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about his challenge to get the team from the northeastern corner of the country back on its feet, and is currently in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the "Lights Stadium" this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my team.
I got into the second team and it was there," Ross told BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"When I was a kid, I often watched Scottish games with my dad at Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about stepping into the shoes of his prominent predecessors with a prominent company. He has previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“At the moment, I’m measuring my own success by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably consider myself successful only if I can get the team back to the Premier League.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months on the Heats’ coaching team.
After that, he helped Alloa rise from the fall games of the third series and raised St Mirren from falling to championships in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at a real crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he took over from Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a fairly good profit and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
But playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work pressure, but managing the team feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for a living, and I feel better in my own body than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows
The summer heatwave has kicked in pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but it has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, says: “The continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July was the June of the year, with a 2.8% increase in pub sales, while for restaurants the month was even worse.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drinks side were the most successful, and their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant runners.
It seems that people just wanted out drinking in their minds.
Sales of beverages in the pubs and bars managed by the companies grew by 6.6% over the month, and food sales fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman of RSM, a provider of leisure and hospitality consulting services, says: “The results continue a trend that has been continuing since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the main factors influencing the sale of out-of-home meal markets.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the annual decline of 4.8% in sales is particularly painful now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have gotten worse for the food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures in August will bring the industry’s desperate need for a break.
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer that tracks the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant sales and collects and analyses performance data from 47 industry-leading groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It is considered to be a reliable indicator of the industry.
One-Fifth of Children Hide Social Media Accounts From Their Parents
One-fifth of children, some as young as 11 years of age, hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, study reveals
A study of 20,000 secondary school students reveals the growing phenomenon of 'Fake Instagram Accounts'
News raises concerns that sexual content can be shared on accounts
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘master account’ that is shown to parents
One-fifth of children, some as young as 11 years old, create social media accounts that they conceal from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the fast-growing existence of 'Fake Instagram Accounts', which refers to an Instagram site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content may be posted on accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they would keep a cleaned 'main' account for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager who hoped to be raped after running into a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter.
A survey commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Directors’ Advisory Council (HMC) found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle "voice of the athletes" to the Scottish athletes' government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athlete Board and participates in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Ian Beattie, the chairman of the board, describes the nomination as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidhi has great respect for athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to my role as a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope I can be useful and help guide the Scottish sport in the right direction."
The four-Olympic gold medal winner, an American athlete who won the 200-meter and 400-meter distances at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as the BBC's regular commentator, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient stroke in the brain.
He tweeted, “A month ago, I had a stroke.”
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say only time will tell if I'm recovering and in what condition.
This has been exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Advertising that equates mothers to cows divides opinions online
An advertisement similar to dairy cows by a breast pump manufacturer has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has launched a product called "the world's first silent breast pump to be worn," and its marketing is accelerated by a cheek-to-cheek ad that describes the freedom that the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with songs such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I can't see the tail" and "in case you didn't notice, it's not the udders, it's the tits".
The chorus continues, "Bomb it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement on the company’s Facebook page caused discussion on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has sparked a controversial reaction among viewers, many saying it is a joke on the dairy industry's daily 'horror'.
"Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: "I understand it's traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
The third commenter added: "Perfect reality-driven ad."
The advertisement also got defenders: a woman admitted that she thought the advertisement was "fun".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product,” reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilets) and 'feel like cows'.
The advertisement is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced discreet pumps stuffed in their bra.
The advertising campaign concept is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and discreetly fits inside the breastfeeding vest, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother Advertising, commented: “The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By combining nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using the breast pump to the spotlight, bringing out the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump brings in an entertaining and identifying way.”
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Moved to Tent Camp at Texas Border
The number of migrant children intercepted has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult for children to be placed in foster families.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a foster family can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would have to provide their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs official, testified in Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for underage migrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people,” Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with children’s cases, the authorities have introduced new rules, which in some cases require the case to be brought before the courts within one month of being arrested, instead of the earlier 60-day time limit, according to the staff of the reception centre.
Many prefer to appear by videoconference rather than in person before the Court of Immigrants.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for assistance will be deported as a matter of urgency.
According to reports published in recent months by reception center workers and the system, the time spent in captivity by children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s despair may pass unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent towns without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering trauma right now.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulayem also urged Syrian refugees to return to their homes after the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputising for the Prime Minister, said foreign troops were illegally in the country under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "they will be acted upon accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the “holy fight until all Syria is cleansed” from both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign forces.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they mainly train and guide the Kurds and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops in the country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called on the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war has been agreed by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale invasion by Russian-backed Syrian forces in an area of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear time limits” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, “who will be exterminated.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new government and opposition committee to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers would probably hope, the dismissal and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, CNN has more than doubled its best-selling figures to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million with MSNBC.
Fox News, according to Nielsen, has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached the peak of 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is a flame that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” ABC’s chief producer of Designated Survivor, Neal Baer, said in a statement.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine what happens in the Roe vs. Wade case, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other, and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the conscious citizen’s responsibilities to watch the sixth hour of an expert panel debating the use of Bob Woodward’s source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich-skinned pilot jacket (a “arrogant garment” according to the Washington Post), and the consequences of stormy Daniels’ unscrupulous descriptions of President Trump’s anatomics.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way I did.
“What he’s doing feels like a reality TV show, because part of it is giving the audience something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawnshop series, about the changing characters on Trump’s show and the daily changing plot twists (NFL quarrel, praise to Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single episode or you'll fall off the chariot.
When I reached Mr. Fleisch this week, he had a lovely sunny day at his place on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away from the program where Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flows from outside for tight mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has faced a real cash flow, as the reorganization of the congress constituency forces two already elected candidates to fight for one place.
This newly redefined Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old division of constituency favored Republicans unconstitutionally.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has launched an economic struggle in the finance departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name became known after the special elections in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March.
The seat had been in the Republican seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20%.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from its plans
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the slight reaction in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “on the basis of recent policies that Taiwan will no longer be recognized,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country, which has a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was seen last year as a step in trying to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that the summit was to proceed, and this effectively ended speculation about possible sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give a signal to the mid-October meeting about the importance the administration gives to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new unpleasant messages or penalties from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next unavoidable step may be the report by Specialist Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of President Trump’s justice, which is now very strong evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reported to be conducting an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and may be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs in this, and I don’t mean to say that the defeat of President Trump would be inevitable – no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We have to find solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the subsequent years of carnage.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, where the inevitable march forward of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these turning points.
What will we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been infamous since it became known that he had proposed a secret recording of the president's speech and was considering the president's possible inability to perform his duties.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these attempts, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated with a scabbard.
How could this legacy be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at their home on Thursday, knowing that after a tie against Villarreal in Spain earlier that month, a victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the pitch this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point.
Maybe we could have gotten a win at the end, but overall, a tie is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got in the second and we were better.
Thursday is another big night in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I believe that with the support of this team, we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The setup is good and the boys enjoy it; the training goes well.
I hope we can now push hard, leave the past behind and be successful.”
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep at night
Although the participants had a clear view of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few had talked about it with their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of the respondents said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Discuss with a professional and your family where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost determining factor.
Bring financial advice into the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
The financing options for long-term care can be, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-cost insurance, if you can afford it.
Create legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care professional on site so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also drawing up a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital because of a medical emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medications and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just a financial issue. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medications are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.”

The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim’s injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Põl on Friday, according to authorities, the number of casualties is expected to increase.
Since communications to the area have been cut off, rescue authorities have not received any information from the north of the area of Donggala municipality, which is closer to the surface center of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
Earthquake and tsunami hit the city during its 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala spans more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of the northwest coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality of Donggala is a provincial administrative district with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, and in particular of the Donggala coastal region, are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have hit Donggala in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire region and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake hit the south side of Indonesia’s most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast of the island, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai islands in Sumatra, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit Aceh’s Pidie Jaya area, causing devastation and panic as people remember the massive devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report by the Alaskan police on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as obstruction and resistance to a report of domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial detention facility and his bail is set at <0x24>500, TV channel KTUU reports.
According to the report, Palin arrived at the courthouse on Saturday and replied that he was “definitely innocent.”
Palin is charged with three class A offences, which means he can face up to a year in prison and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence, for which he can be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin’s mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving the possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are cut off and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central Sulawesi on the northeastern side of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media about the earthquake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Porel when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in October to hit a cycling path on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, where he ran into pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included charges of eight murders for aiding a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this crime title in cases related to organised crime. In addition, the indictments included charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required “considerable planning and preparation,” prosecutors said and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as “horrible, cruel and shameful.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time a court in the Southern District of New York passed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last applied in a federal case in New York City in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed two years earlier for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, did not show any signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov said he had been inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to the 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, a federal defense attorney representing Saipov, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"In our view, the decision to demand the death penalty instead of recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that will only prolong the trauma caused by these events to those affected," Patton said.
Saipov’s defence had previously requested that the death penalty not be imposed on him.
The Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be held accountable in Brexit talks.
Nigel Farage pledged in a protest against the Conservatives today to “mobilize the civil army.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain "would be out already" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But as she reconciles her deeply divided ranks, May faces a challenge underlined by the conservatives in favour of staying, who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the brink of the squeeze of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
The supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the setback – and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to “discard the Chequers proposal.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough’s MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal.”
He said: "We didn't fight world wars to end up being subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the idea that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “That the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false statement.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party, nor by the activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success in general.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would have to feel pressure if they were to reverse the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to water down Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to turn Brexit around to feel pressure from you.”
“We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state.”
In the meantime, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city center.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was formed this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get their IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus arrangement and smooth border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported a Massachusetts Democrat talking about his future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face the re-elect Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign, in November.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters since the beginning of Trump’s term.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place.
Arrest in LSU's Sims shooting
Louisiana's Baton Rouge police on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team arrangements play an important role in the race.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to his own fate in defending his position in the first two rounds, calling Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the deck first and left Hamilton behind, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the deck later in the lap and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed after making some contact and after the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner line, giving up defending his position after only two third turns.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the rear row and was seventh in the first round.
After that, he was in the lead for a large part of the race, prolonging the change of tyres, aiming for a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He reached the quarterfinals in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps when Räikkönen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
"The team has made an exceptional effort and won a double win," Hamilton said.
Very poor body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a ceremony in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an expression of "people's malice, malice, and dishonesty."
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that’s been going on in the Senate in the last few days, when we see the anger, the people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest,” he said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you date this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you year the document - ‘Oh, what?
Oh, no. No.
I didn't leak."
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we--No, we didn't leak," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban was not acceptable to the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday's event: "Let me tell you, that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of sexual harassment and alleged that the democrats were using the accusations for their own benefit.
“They have decided to get back to power by any means necessary.
“You see that wickedness and evil, they don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the loss of Friday's Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillieri.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the level before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced for the fourth time in the season after the Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pass, and David Rutherford passed when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the opening season, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched the Cowns' handicap goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' lead in the first set break by scoring his second goal of the evening at the end of the first set.
The home team gathered their ranks and Bouchard scored again in overwhelming 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces, and Nielsen scored the first lead goal for Dundee at the end of the second round. He also secured a victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at their home on Friday.
The pilot died while making sure hundreds of passengers on board were able to escape the earthquake.
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller has become a hero after his death by ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers can safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a violent earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Severe aftershocks are hitting the area and several people have been trapped in the trapped material in Please City.
While his co-workers ran for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stood still and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, currently on the runway, could safely take flight.
He then jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said Agung’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
A helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Return.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will rise to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have reported that links to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are inadequate.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to rise because several bodies are buried in the ruins and many people have not been reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said in a statement.
The waves, which have grown to six metres, have destroyed Please, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring assistance and equipment to the area.
35-year-old Risa Kusuma told Sky News: <0x23>Ambulances bring bodies all the time.

Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, Jan Gelfand, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it can turn out to be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo returned to Indonesia on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline of the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now say one person is missing, although all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the plane.
Air Niugini said it had not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, the passengers were able to wade in the sinking plane in wading water for emergency exits.
He said the passenger crew had panicked and screamed, and that he himself had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen who were repairing the nearby dock were involved in the rescue by carrying people ashore in a rubber boat before the plane sank in waters about 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
An analyst presents a timeline for the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded a retrial in which the man was charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used data stored on his cell phone to gather together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim’s death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was in conflict with his previous allegations of being with Chambers the night he died, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information showed that Tellis’s cell phone was with Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned him.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was “lying because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final statements of the defense are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge negative perceptions about the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were about politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York babysitter sues couple over racist text message
A New York babysitter sues the couple for discriminatory disfellowshipping after accidentally receiving a text message from the child’s mother complaining that she is “again a black man.”
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived at work on her first day at work in 2016 and found out she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, AGAIN DARK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But then, instead of her husband, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that his former African-American nanny, who had been dismissed, had done her job poorly and that she had been expecting a Filipino this time.
Maurice got paid for one day of work and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for their separation and wants <0x24>350 a day for the six months for which he was originally hired to live and work for the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the racist allegations, saying that terminating Maurice’s employment was a legitimate decision because they could not trust him for offending him.
"My wife sent him something he wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your child with someone you’ve been unkind to, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco compared the challenge to blackmail and said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Is someone going to be chased in this situation?
It’s not very comfortable,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, stamping out their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: “It’s hard to feel in the position of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny now that Paddington’s huge popularity is known.”
Saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before dedicating himself to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books felt bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington "described him as a very important family member" and noted that his father was silently proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a bragging type at all," she says.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you are proud of, though not really your own.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"They kept calling me and telling me that the situation was really bad, that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter was going to die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'm with you."
The drugs that the doctors used to keep her heart running gradually disappeared from her body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it's all gone.
I could just sit there knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Eventually, grieving over the loss of her daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane among other passengers - who knew nothing about the trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
I kept my head down and the tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous compassion for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support from.
Davis' son Tyler fell ill at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that her smile would light up the whole room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt “in darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of being together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened their presents, she didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
He notes that Mark’s death was a traumatic one for them, but they must survive: “It breaks up the family.
It will tear us apart.
But we just have to keep on living and fighting forward.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI opens investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a limited investigation in time and scope - we might be able to achieve a little unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would 'break' into a dead end caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, November 6, and if Republicans’ success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's time and met his wife Ashley through him, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
In the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, a vote will be held.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game off and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans Declining During Kim's Period
According to South Korean lawmakers, the number of people who have fled North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification as saying that there were 1,127 leaps last year, from 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the decisive factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in human traffickers’ prices.
No public comment has been made on Pyongyang.
Most North Korean refugees will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily-protected demilitarized zone between the two countries.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most often returns them forcibly.
Technically, relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on stalled talks on the demolition of nuclear arms.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on a general effort towards nuclear denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for stalling sanctions after the summit.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security will not be on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally begin to disarm first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if she had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotionally overwhelmed, and at times he almost screamed and lost his ability to speak while telling about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee’s democrats, without calling the accusations against himself “a grotesque and planned persecution of a person” organized by liberals vexed by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony would show that he was unable to act in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
When asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives, he wondered.
“Let’s say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently works,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Fear added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders on health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice user.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
“It’s not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected as a member of the court and we should be expected to say that it’s wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women have to cope with everything.
It’s a legitimate speech with months and years of rage going on, and he can’t keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
He continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her interlocutor when she got angry and started crying, ‘You might think I’m sad now because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are justified as an outburst of rage, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early employment in a male-dominated office is when I once cried speechlessly out of rage, and an older woman - a cold-hearted superior I had always feared - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’re happy because they made you angry.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business in 1987 and was expelled from the race, Schroeder felt very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates and the least we needed was one more.
Someone called the situation 'Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
Since the campaign was over, he was lagging behind the fundraiser, and so he announced that he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He learned that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates <0x24>1,000, gave him only <0x24>250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude to his supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work on voters rather than delegates, and hatred for sexism - that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I'd have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reaction of the press.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be beaten for an obituary.
“She was crying.”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war was overwhelming, and while the fight is far from over, a breakup between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week occurred with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of imported goods, effectively taxing half of all Chinese imports into the United States.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5% to 10% on US imports worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-for-eye style, and it does not seem that the world’s second-largest economic power is waning for a moment.
To get Washington to retreat, we should give in to our own demands, but public bows to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing interdependence between countries.
"A quick political decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, could create the conditions that are starting an economic downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than bystanders have ever realized," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-based research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria’s foreign minister says Syria is “ready” for refugee return
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees to return voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulayem said conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
The circumstances now make it possible for refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for help in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team on 16.5 vs 10.5 Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team retained the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had difficulties almost throughout the tournament, and he hit his starter punch in the water in the 16th hole of the par-3 track, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of the four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
America’s Jordan Spieth was eliminated in a 5&4 against the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Denmark’s Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup golf veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It’s a team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after winning the European team.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 individual competitions on Sunday.
"I feel tremendously proud of winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange stats from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding lanes throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was at a high level throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in the games this morning.
We resisted.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We re-group, I work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
“These 12 guys are great and I’m proud to be their captain.
I gotta take off my hat.
We met our winners.”
Red tide algae blooming situation: decrease in concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the number of algae in the Tampa Bay area is declining overall.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algae areas are reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a possible reduction in concentrations.
Red tide algae blooms along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be seen ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Red tide algae blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported in the past week off the coast of Pinellas County, ranging from low to high on the coasts of Hillsborough County, from background concentrations to high concentrations in the counties of Manatee and Sarasota, from background concentrations to moderate concentrations in the county of Charlotte and from background concentrations to high concentrations in the coasts of the Lee District and the Collier District.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Over the past week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwestern part of Florida.
