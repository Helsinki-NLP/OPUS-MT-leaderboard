Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness, and now she's doing art on the theme - "Man should have a right to his own body"
Dozens of patient reports hang from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts’ Project room gallery.
They all have Camille Auer's name on them.
The papers tell a long story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
They decided for him who he was.
“I wanted to share my personal medical history to make the violence of the process visible,” Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender change process.
It is often a years-long research period that involves meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral for the "gender identity disorder" diagnostic studies, which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process began four years ago.
Before this, she had already used the estrogen she had ordered via the Internet and was already very advanced in her own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to be able to legally correct the gender.
The Translating Act (563/2002) obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilize in order to get the right gender, for example, in a population register centre and a passport.
Currently, every gender corrective is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," said Auer.
Trans law reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight remarks on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government was preparing the amendment of the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
Elections were fired and the Finns took up the government.
The change in the law is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about the amendment of the law," said Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines that Auer is taking.
In the patient story installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the transpol psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, she wrote a story that would define Auer's right to care and help.
The sense of reality is subject to disruption.
The subject’s self-concept appears to be fragmented in a borderline-level manner, and personality-related unstable traits are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with a mental illness," Auer says.
What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given sex-change treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpol waiting lobby into the air.
Later that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Exclud, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that anyone who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove the breasts,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are more than your sex at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the process of gender correction is more difficult for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
The participants will meet dozens of people to whom they must justify their own existence and their right to their own sex experience.
“It’s crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that they don’t have enough resources,” Auer says.
Many of the participants in the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, potential experiences of bullying.
On this basis, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Preventing access to care and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
The depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, I felt better.
She had finally been able to articulate the feelings that had existed since childhood and adolescence.
Why the wide chin didn’t seem to fit in my body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using voice and movements," he says.
Today, Auer feels she is already being seen, she exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, random comments from close people could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when close people have sexual intercourse.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they don’t agree or can’t internalize it,” he said.
However, not all transgender people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, a condition in which the body or parts of the body can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, you cannot get an official confirmation of your own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in relation to legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identification number, in which he/she says that he/she feels that he/she is of the other sex.
After the six-month reflection period, the applicant confirms his or her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identification number.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and this demand is also summed up in the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

Civil Rights Organization issues travel warning to Missouri
The National Afro-American Civil Rights Organization (NAACP) has issued a travel warning against Missouri, due to its discriminatory practices and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s Missouri travel announcement will come into force on August 28, 2017, and urges African-American travellers, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state that has recently witnessed a series of dubious racial incidents,” the organization said in a statement.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to export discrimination cases to the courts, and the state's enforcement of laws disproportionately targets minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuing of a travel warning.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped for their skin colour and beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, chairman of the NAACP in Missouri, in a statement to the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short period of time."
The Missouri Travel Alert is the first U.S. state warning issued by the organization.
The organization cited examples of racist remarks against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by the Missouri police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
A Missouri attorney general’s office said police were 75% more likely to arrest a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel release is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by bringing in money to pay bail or telling relatives they’re going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, Missouri had one hundred hate crimes in 2015, the sixteenth largest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, the organization that defends the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration offences. The organization says this increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department and affect other states, but recently they have been issued by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Central), responsible for state ownership governance, has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension payment received by the airline’s CEO, Pekka Vauramo, says Yle.
According to the Minister, this conflicts with the state’s declaration of will.
The additional pension of EUR 130,000 received by Vauramo was highlighted this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has ruled that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s resolution on ownership governance.
Immediately, the sanctions intensified.
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were moving from cold to warm.
At the G20 summit in Hamburg, President Donald Trump of the United States and President Vladimir Putin of Russia seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted to in Russia.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Trump’s sanctions bill meant “a full trade war.”
Even if Russia’s reactions are offset only by political rhetoric and exaggerations, the tightening of U.S.-Russia relations after a short honeymoon after Trump’s election is a fact.
In the United States, the passing of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
Although the law was passed by Congress with considerable unanimity, it was reported that it was much more difficult for the president to pass.
Trump recently criticized the bill as “significantly inadequate.”
The reason for President Trump’s wilfulness may have been Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law that restricts his own powers must also have been disgusting.
As is well known, investigations are underway in the United States regarding both Russia’s possible interference in the presidential elections and Trump’s connections to Russia.
The tension between the US and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the staff of the White House has changed frequently and various scandalous twists and turns have been revealed almost to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not being conducted under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia has a strong relationship with the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union’s core region of the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the surface, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland, which does a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real burden.
The impact of the US sanctions is still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions of liquid natural gas (LNG), which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of demonstrating disapproval in world politics.
Economic sanctions, however, must be well-considered and rigorous.
Otherwise, they are more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House has the Statue of Liberty in its sights
Interfering with the statues is the strongest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, overthrew the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the top ideologists in the Trump administration, knew well what was going on in a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a dispute over the president’s proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attacks were on the significance of the statue and, in particular, the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the pedestal of the statue – 17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller told Acosta: "I don't want to go into history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The words of Lazarus are the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not only immigrants, but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The written complaint of your teeming shore."
The poem is more topical than ever.
He made it clear that the "poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the significance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal, knowing well that the act was highly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republicanism with a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American nationalist idea.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a whistleblower who can now be seen as some sort of prediction of Trump, claimed that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is the early pioneer of the neo-conservatives, taking the torch of the United States into a world covered with darkness: “Lady Liberty steps out.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
That’s not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not point the way, but kindles the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, Executive Vice President of the British Athletics Federation, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are a "significant reinforcement".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Black said there was "something special going on in Scotland" and that British athletics had to learn from it.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what's going on," Black says.
"I talked to representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation believes that it will be associated with the activities of the Federation,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is based on their activities.
And the average streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s something great, whatever the reason.”
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful," Black said.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidhi’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle, the silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in the 400m hurdles, and these are her fifth World Championships, finds it "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records in the past year.
He competes in London in 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, but he is also worth keeping an eye on: he has an excellent season behind him, which includes winning the British World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the national team's only Scotsman besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is “immensely proud” to have so many Scots, some of whom are really competing for the final places and medals.
"Being captain is a great honour anyway, but it's even more special because the national team members voted for the captain," Doyle said.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prizes.
My captain's speech?
I think it went all right.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and to be back at the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be amazing.”
Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism must have annoyed you.
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led dumb and silent like sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
Hogan was sued by the U.S. Civil Rights League earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also understated online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the remarkably popular Republican governor of the Democratic-dominated state.
He has the second highest ranking among 50 governors.
Hogan's not responsive to hotheads.
He has led the state steadfastly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a photo of a bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users from coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was just a question of moderating comments.
However, stigmatizing commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to leaders of their choice, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, for example.
They said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and appropriate.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely comment that I am disappointed that Hogan has not commented on the hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in a Washington Post commentary.
“I also cannot accept that when more than one person comments on the same issue, they are immediately considered to be somehow organized and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack." Someone else could call them to advance what they thought was important.
In the age of Facebook, it’s easy to manage communication by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It’s the same thing now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudoun County Government violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Liberties Union visited to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with Kentucky’s Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington’s time, cheap postage had the same effect as the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls then.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers in which they scoffed at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, the U.S.-UK Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement, as documented by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means acknowledging this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, plus online announcements from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from Haapavede and Seinäjoki, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green peaches have died of a parasitic disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially the bulge.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be detected in marsupial birds.
In 2009 it got really good.
At that time, trichomonase caused a major collapse in the Finnish green beetroot strain, after which the populations of the species have been on the road to recovery.
There have now been sick green beanies, but at least not yet on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, Museum Master at the University of Helsinki’s Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Creative).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green peacock will recur again if nothing is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty Wants to Benefit from Homerunning at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home-field presence for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament at the neighbouring Archerfield Links field last year before the last round, but lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and serves as the tournament's ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club and this event will bring it to its full glory,” Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is the zealous ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field.”
Eales is defending the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special occasion," the Southport player says.
"I couldn't defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come back: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil, joining the tour earlier this year when he turned 50.
This is her first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Gambling at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played quite hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, along with Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade, at least so far, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air surveys are still ongoing.
The investigations began when a man who had interrupted his conscript service for health reasons suspected that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no health problems have been identified for other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that the other staff members of the unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this issue thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade’s statement says that due to the July arrival batch, goods have had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have seemed stale, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove in her cooking.
He also rarely uses the pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the turbulent Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts sweet potatoes – locally “take” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the stubble is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
She sits on a muddy floor, where she usually also carries out her daily chores, such as washing in cloudy water from a nearby bog.
The toilet is provided by a bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and she is not assigned to care for fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the people in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which tightly controls the area and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The journey starts with a one and a half hour flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a five-hour trip in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
With a population of about 19,000, the city has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with corrosion on the corrugated roofs.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago people worshiped the Uga Tamee god.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei says. She means her colorful, hand-woven winding headdress, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"Before we had only leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, with child mortality and illiteracy among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. Just a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine generated <0x24>3.1 billion in gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated <0x24>78 billion in wood reserves.
For Papuas, however, these riches bring misery, because they mean the repressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers being paid up to <0x24>150,000.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
Human rights activists say the Indonesian army has killed, raped, tortured and imprisoned more than 500,000 Papuans since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the highlands of Papua tribes in the 1970s took proportions to genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people were arrested in peaceful demonstrations by the Indonesian police.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, reports the atrocities of the previous year, including extrajudicial executions, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular – and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because there are cases every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened as Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographic is changing as Muslims from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mixture in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market for less than locals,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Pania, who moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta’s Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You said.
Pania experienced some kind of wave bottom just two months after Jokow’s inauguration in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by a fire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles came out of the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports of victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured and beat the children with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma after being assaulted.
A few hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans —young men, women, and children— gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried hunting bows for ceremonial ceremonies and began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, dancing in circles and imitating bird songs.
Some protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hotter, the soldiers were told on the internal radio system: "If crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." This information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been disclosed to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto district, felt the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house painted in bright color.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME magazine, sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Yotje Mende, the chief police inspector in Papua, told reporters that the police were simply "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua Police Department, said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the killing reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing like this ever happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
He immediately began to withdraw from his speech.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we are determined to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed to do so," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be clarified in court," he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity" related to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been solved, including Paniai incidents.
The families of the Paniai victims are grimly distrustful of the allegations.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he still lives in fear, even though it’s been years.
“Yes, I am afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panicians are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighboring area of Paniai in Deiya.
One was killed and 17 were injured in a conflict between villagers and the head of a construction company, which began when the head refused to take the man who had lost his mind to the hospital, including children.
Ravianus Douw, a 24-year-old man who had been caught by the water while fishing on a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at a construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, the Indonesian paramilitary police’s mobile police unit opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the shooting of police officers to be held accountable and for a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, who live in the lush mid-heavens of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the Papuans through occasional attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the insurrection by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among Papuas, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
There's very little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that's too expensive for the locals.
Like the bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to locally better educated and wealthier migrants.
Few people have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua has little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare photographic license due to their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia’s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
“Journalists reporting on Indonesia’s turbulent eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only from its closest neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “numerous and widespread violations”, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations.”
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Barer visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, an anonymous source said.
Indonesia's presidential election is 2019, but Papuas say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
"Jokowi has good intentions, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting scene," said Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know about the situation of the Panaeans: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and want, practically without health care and education.
According to Gobai, the Panaeans, like other Papuans, consider their votes to be a "debt" to be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again demonstrated symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head bent.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora says Robert Helenius' rematch has been cancelled: "Even his fans don't want to see him"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight in the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora blames Helenius for flopping the rematch entirely on his shoulders.
My game in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
"Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable," Chisora said.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversy.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomi in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
There has been nothing new from the match since.
However, it is no longer annoying to Chisara.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled because of Chisora’s illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up with a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
“The hospital told me I had to have surgery,” Chisora said.
The British are currently in a state of health of about 45%.
Apparently, he's not interested in a rematch with Helenius, he's looking at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora defeated Whyte in December with a scattered vote.
Fire strikes Torch skyscraper in Dubai for second time
On Friday, hundreds of residents were forced to flee from a 337-meter-high 79-storey building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, no one was known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's rescue officials said the firefighters were able to shut down the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
This incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
Following the fire in 2015, the board of directors of the Torch building commissioned a study that found that the most damage was caused by the boards used for the cladding and insulation of the facade.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and cladding plates of Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot overnight.
A moped was stolen from the parking lot in the River Suului on Tuesday between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was called Sky Team Monkey.
The colour is red and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.

More than 20 percent of U.S. airline passengers carry prohibited items on board, according to a survey
A survey of airline passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unwittingly taken prohibited articles onto aircraft past U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints, and at least six percent of passengers had knives or other blade-equipped items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they only found out afterwards that they had accidentally carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than 1,000 passengers responded to the survey, carried out by the charter airline Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of the passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules, 19.7 per cent were members of Generation Y and less than 15 per cent were members of Generation X.
The most common violation of the rules was by taking food and liquids on the plane.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately taking blade-equipped items onto an aircraft, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said that they had deliberately taken prohibited drugs onto an aircraft.
The company, which conducted the survey, wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggled goods past security checks and how many had deliberately done so.
It is not surprising that those who travel most are also most likely to pass smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly.
But, as the company who conducted the survey notes, the TSA’s guidelines are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids they can take on an airplane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the seizures by the TSA are liquids.
For a while, there was also the belief that books were not allowed on the plane.
You can take liquids to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt reverses decision to delay Obama’s decision to cut emissions
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt overturned his earlier decision to delay Obama’s decision to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads takes better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the states than in previous administrations.
Mr Pruitt did not mention a word about the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should start complying with the 2015 ground ozone standard from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year ahead so that his agency would have more time to look at the plan, as the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth."
Pruitt was the Oklahoma State Attorney General before President Donald Trump appointed him EPA Director. Pruitt is known for opposing stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to relax the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA director exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged them to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that her overturning on ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on schedule.
“During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for groups of activists and others to sue it to reach an agreement on timetables,” Pruitt said. In her previous post, she sued the Environment Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation that governs our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise “its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the provisions “are justified and based on the best available information.”
In Congress, Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations.
The aim of the bill, adopted last month, is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the state coalition that sued the EPA this week, said the group would continue to put pressure on them.
"The EPA's change of mind as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuits included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ozone occurs when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems to sensitive groups of people and is a contributing factor in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists were delighted by Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy responsible for our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interested groups.”
Supercar manufacturer coming to SUV - "happens in Ferrari style"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars, while trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in the Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer unveils its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of measles in Eastern Savo are of the same virus type
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports the THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday, July 28, in a person living on the shores of Salt Lake has the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all the infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may appear from the fifth person until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over yet, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, doctor responsible for infectious diseases in Soster’s primary care.
No new cases of measles or suspicion of measles have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for a permissible screaming act
The soup was not even considered for legalization.
In the background, the argument that the process produces methanol in addition to liquor, which is toxic.
It will be legal to make kilts at home next year, but the legalization of the soup of squash will not even be considered.
Kilju is made by fermentation, squash by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol in addition to liquor, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make the soup of redcurrants a right of everyman,” said Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of redcurrants was not considered for legalisation.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalization of distillation, says MEP Outi Mäkelä.
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups in the government parties, which took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Promise to distill the red berries at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen tells us that when making alcoholic beverages at home, there is a simple rule: you can make alcohol at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make screams at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of kilts, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still be done in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings and flavourings resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you like, and you can give yourself a gift of homemade alcohol.
It should not be put on sale.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when the import of passengers from Estonia and other EU countries was liberalised.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act comes to Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session was held on 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital escorted by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to a South African hospital for suspicion of heart attack.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving a prison sentence in Ateridgeville.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Translated phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
Transcriptions of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Mr. Nieto for publicly knocking down the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern US border at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcription of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement to allow the United States to take refugees on their way to Australia would be "lame", "sad" and "stupid". Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump interrupted Turnbull by saying, “This was the most unpleasant call I’ve had all day.”
Georgia Massacre: Activists re-spoke racist lynchage in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes crowds in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and looks through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man coughs.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-scene that was presented on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are real when the loop is hung around the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to stage the events of 1946, when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the re-arrangement.
“It is a stain of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs upon our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-scene is an astonishing invitation to action and a reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to go to court, we want things to be finally settled, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all, we want justice," Brooks said.
"We can't recover and reconcile until we get justice."
A coroner covers the body of a victim who died in the Georgia massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives for lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential elections by a decision of the Supreme Court in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, an incident occurred in which a black landowner, Roger Malcom, stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that allegedly involved Malcom’s wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the town had rumors that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a powerful white landowner, paid Malcom a <0x24>600 bail against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
A mob stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
“It was a right to vote,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same would happen to them if they were to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-scene of the Georgia massacre for almost a decade.
It is an extremely realistic and captivating depiction of the appalling racism that many would like to believe has disappeared from the United States today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to watch what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides," the director said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you can’t hear me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and about 20 whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan in the remake for years, but the role is always equally difficult and disgusting.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh said.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history be brought to the fore so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcolm shouts and pushes Hester, who is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? I said leave my land, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then we're going to hit.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene said.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n---u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You'll have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friendly spirit.
Everyone wants to be successful, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are snapping.
Nobody's laughing.
The revival ends quickly and violently.
Shots, screams, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings the song Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday.
His voice breaks with every second word.
A few dozen meters away, about fifty spectators wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the public is black and half is white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show in Ithaca, New York State, but most of them are local.
They've been visiting the victims' graves under Brooks' guidance in Georgia's pressing humidity.
The murders have turned from the story into reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites the crowd to examine the bodies.
The children squat to look at false blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy murmurs as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the licks took off their cloaks and wiped their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a hard performance.
"It's okay," the woman in the show comforts me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a dinner.
A white couple from Altanta are discussing the show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when describing the feelings aroused by the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to the terrible words and watch the terrible acts that are said and done by people who look like you—just because they look like you,” she says.
"The show made me realize that lynchings are still taking place," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for those sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“Re-inventing is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
“Its message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Growing up vegetables in stores makes you feel upset: This is how much removing "extra parts" really saves you
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
What about taking out a large piece of a pineapple hat - how much does it weigh?
The answers strongly divide opinions: for one, it is an indication of extreme lumpiness, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go to the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, you can find cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable section of Ruoholahti in Helsinki, because many people tear off the leaves of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to commercial biowaste.
According to the news published in the economic newspapers, groping at the vegetable counter amazes merchants.
But how much does removing excess portions of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is this sniffing method really?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapples, top artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower remove leaves or stems.
Flower cabbage: the price of 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.30 fell to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Latva artichoke: the price of 2.60 euros was 2.40 euros when the short stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stocks, the price would be 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a strain 80 cents.
The result: If you start picking leaves and strains, you can save a few dozen centimeters for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona and signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday, it was reported that representatives of Neymar had paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona.
The transfer amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, who paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million last summer for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the move earlier Thursday when it rejected Neymar's representatives' first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the league, the club that buys cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his/her contract himself/herself, which is done by wagering the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be presented to a new home audience at the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
The UEFA examines the details.
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association UEFA in order to enable the association to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Spain’s league president Javier Tebas has accused PSG of violating UEFA’s financial fair play rules.
UEFA could penalise a club that makes a loss of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million over a three-year period.
UEFA says Neymar’s move does not automatically violate its financial regulations.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG will have an impact on the club’s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial sums, UEFA said.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, was severely burned by lightning flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing normal work on a plane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly a lightning strikes a plane from a rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw Dunn near the wing of the plane into the ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me that my brother had an electric shock and that he was in the hospital.
“I asked if he was alive,” Austin’s sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he also had muscle damage and cerebral haemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident, and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and boost business by cutting dividends
The British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it will cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72 percent when it launches a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to John Fallon, CEO, the job losses will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company has already cut 4,000 jobs in the context of previous restructuring.
Pearson has announced that it will cut costs again by <0xC2><0xA3>300 million in May as part of its third savings program to revive the business that has deteriorated as a result of rapid digitalization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for this year unchanged. Its revenue grew by 1% in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, killing 30 people on Tuesday in an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a statement by NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a “man-made explosive device carried by a person.”
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were treated in a US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of ISIS in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, a region where predominantly Shia Muslims live.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, the country’s most devastating attack by a militant group since the U.S.-led overthrow of the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its politics and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration’s decisions to reduce smog emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called “ozone definitions” late on Wednesday, saying the decision was a sign of its commitment to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states,” said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone definitions for one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, smoke smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where the pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mostly Democratic-dominated states, including the District of Columbia, claiming that deferral of execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate Barack Obama’s environmental regulations, saying the measures are part of a broader agenda for economic growth.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA’s website, breathing ozone-containing air “can impair lung function and increase breathing symptoms” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of ISIS had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted prior to security checks.
The police have not yet explained why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas emitting device and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist attacks, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation continues.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste’s profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Matti Lievosen, CEO, the company achieved good results in petroleum products, sales of renewable products reached record levels and the development of the Marketing & Services segment’s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievosen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is proceeding well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017,” Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss possible match at first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on the collision course towards the most exciting boxing match of the upcoming 66.7-pound series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men stayed in their own rooms at the ESPN Sports Channel in Los Angeles until WBC’s invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, WBO’s upper feather champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won at Showtime by unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on the list of boxers in different weight classes.
Garcia reached out his right hand and asked, "How are you, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
When the pair posed for photographers, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas pointed out that a match between the men would be “perfect in terms of sizes.”
"I'm a former featherer," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small, 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to light.
He's gonna have to climb into the lightweight [61.2 pounds] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be arranged on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko will debut in a lightweight league later this year and will fight Garcia (37–0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested to face the lightweight winner of the game between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell in September.
"The match could be on the pay-per-view channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later announcing that she was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts that much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might be going to see the match on Saturday.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's flattery and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the force of the punch and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted the match between them to be more and more intense.
“This is the game we are waiting for.
No other game attracts as much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was looking forward to fighting the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary 5,300 euros, education whatever happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment adviser of the banker’s business spoke nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening will be based on the new MiFID, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements in the law.
The Financial Services Authority (FA) recommends that those working in an investment service take their own APV1 or APV2 examinations.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of degrees for APV-Investment Qualifications Ltd, a company whose research group consists of experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry actors.
The degrees cover 12-15 credits, and the exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd., which provides management development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degrees consists of 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the passing rate of the exams is roughly 70 per cent.
Of the staff of the largest banks, almost all providers of investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 examinations, as these are mandatory under the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning the names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing the examinations, Savikko says.
According to him, there are “a few” such bankers.
According to Saviko, 13,000-14,000 people have completed the APV1 qualification since 2000, and some 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors.
Some banking firms consider a degree to be an advantage.
Many other industries have much stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the completion of APV examinations, because then the competence related to the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros a month in commissions, including benefits in kind and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours paid monthly are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men earn more than 5,900 euros per month and women more than 4,500 euros per month.
On average, one-tenth of those who earn the most earn around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,100.
A tenth of the men who earn the most earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 per month or more, and a tenth of the women who earn the most earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,400 or more.
Investment advice in accordance with the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been trusted at the employee and task level.
According to Fiva, the inspection carried out by Fiva revealed individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor’s activities.
In principle, you can also be a seller of investment products, even if you have a low level of skill and competence.
In the first place, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new MiFID II directive.
This requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently skilled.
In turn, the Financial Supervisory Authority should be empowered to dictate what needs to be known.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current one is the legislation on the requirements for the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms’ own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be empowered to dictate competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has an obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the job descriptions of the personnel at an individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, it is also a new requirement to work with someone who is more experienced for a certain period of time if the level of competence or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not exactly meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules will become stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
A 787 Dreamliner 'drawn' a giant plane over the United States
The flight route was plotted over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with the 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long-haul flight.
Departing from Seattle in 18 hours and 1 minute, the plane flew 15,700 kilometers, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States throughout the journey.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra’s persevering beach swimming students are not affected by the rain or the sun’s roast - Iines Kaikkonen’s polski perseveres with the help of a swimming pool village
Iines Kaikkonen proceeded at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra’s beach swimming schools will run in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even if it rains sometimes and then it shines again, the young swimmers are not a bit of a mess, says Taina Itkonen, the head of the swimming schools.
A total of 13 children will be able to swim in this week’s swimming schools, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the Eskari will begin then, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation by the Liikunta unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday there was a nice atmosphere on the beach.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with the swimming villages, someone already without them.
The younger siblings also enjoyed the water.
The five-year-old thought he was going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to cheer for the beach.
You're doing great!
She told me that she went swimming a lot this summer.
Sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You can also be happy with today’s achievements, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 years old, once again wanted to be a water warrior.
His daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who watched swimming from the beach, Ilona Villberg considers the beach swimming school to be a good start for swimming lessons.
No matter what the weather is, I love coming here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed up at the pier.
The boys had enough work to do with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the towels on the pier, snacked fruit and roasted the day.
The lesson continued in the water, but there was no hurry at the pier.
It’s not like you don’t belong in the summer.
Unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's a kind of unifying story"
You see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product range a couple of days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes, laundry racks, and "toilet brush with rim brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film, which will be released in the autumn.
Still, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been laughed at on social media: When will the Unknown health ties come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, the Vice President of Sinituote say?
We are the film’s partner.
We’re supporting this film, like so many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film,” Määttä says.
According to him, there will be a special presentation of the products in the shops, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story here that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products,” Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
Cleaning is not alien to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other business partners of Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saluto, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichys have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been removed by Suomen Kuvalehti blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and clocks are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so the continuation is still under way.
The partners of the unknown have not yet revealed their war products, e.g. Valio, Rajottaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New age test results for asylum seekers in Sweden announced
The latest results of medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been released. The results of tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were found to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the real age of applicants claiming to be minors.
To date, the Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
In addition, in 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency determined that the test subject was ‘possibly 18 years of age or older’.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age stated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency says the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no big differences between the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were "indicatives that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet looked at the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
In the medical age assessment method used for tests, X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic resonance imaging of knee joints are taken. Then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans.
"I have had some reason to think about it and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
"If we can't determine the age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of defining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test subject is about to turn 18 years old, at which point the risk is about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 seats in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilonen spent 30 points down on the scoreboard in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left the shared 11th place on Saturday, but at the end of the round he was able to share 41st place.
In a difficult weather, Ilonen gathered one double bog to accompany three bogs.
Others had a hard time too.
Englishman Ian Poulter got up to split the top spot in the one under par round, although he said there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
The weather was rough, but I was hanging with it and finally it was a good day, Poulter thought.
He shares the lead with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor to Change Party
West Virginia’s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at a Trump campaign event that he would change party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The crowd burst into applause.
"Tomorrow as a registered member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time for a new game.”
Trump has promised that a major announcement will be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in the state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about <0x24>1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday evening that “Governor Justice’s party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which is building barriers rather than a better America.”
“The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this situation, Justice’s announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, people-connecting message,” RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS.
Lightning sowed damage - Thursday is even becoming the most thunderstorm day of the summer
There will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland at the end of the week.
During the past week, there have been thunderstorms especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday could be the worst thunderstorm day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, lightning has occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
The lightning struck the power plant of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report about the fire about 15 minutes after midnight on Wednesday.
The power centre was located at the end of the terraced house.
The Rescue Department dismantled the roof and wall to find the fire outlets and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but injuries were avoided.
At Loimaa, lightning set the outbuilding on fire in Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full state of fire, and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
A fifty-square-foot-square-foot outbuilding burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä once again lightning struck a detached house.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
Rescue services came to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses burned.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The information about the fault was received on Thursday morning between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally on the thunderstorm-driven part of the line.
Lightning has sown destruction in different parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been a total mess! says the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s on-call meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but due to the low lightning balance in the summer, many people feel strong.
This might seem like a really loud thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like compared to the thunderstorms this summer, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, land lightning flashes blinked 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential for even the harshest thunderstorm day of the summer: around 4 p.m. there were 1,790 land lightning flashes in the poster.
If the lightning still continues on the side of the evening, then it can be over two thousand lightnings, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning flashes in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of lightning flashes this year had risen to 18,386.
There is still something to catch, so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the storm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovisen, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favorable environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is expected to shift from the northernmost parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where approximately 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There will be more uniform rainfall in the central parts of the country.
In such cases, according to Tuovisen, thunders only seldom.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised Russia's open-minded apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban.
Russian athletics director Dmitry Shlyahtin said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Cup on Thursday that the Russian ban is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was "sorry on behalf of all the athletes who were deprived of the gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very straightforward and very open-minded," Coe, the chairman of the IAAF, told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and said it was doing everything in its power to restructure its operations."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
“In the coming months, we will have to do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet a number of requirements before it could be restored to its status.
"Tests are still inadequate and the banned coaches continue to operate freely," he told reporters at the IAAF Council on Friday after his presentation in London.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not succeed as the filmmakers hoped, Yle says.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admits Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film’s budget of around five million euros.
There is no such thing as winning the lottery, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been better at home, they would have had their money by now.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the Financial Rules of Football Affect Neymar’s Movement to Paris
Neymar's transfer from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France, is not prevented by regulations restricting the use of money by European football clubs, which is the most expensive transfer ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, the European football regulator, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play economic rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million for the termination of the Brazilian deal, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a number of economic aspects.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer sum and joining him in its stargarde, as it will be financed by Qatar's oil-rich dynasty.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they need to be balanced by real sources of income to ensure that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from club debts to tracking their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of Roman Abramovich's first business model in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of Fair Play’s financial rules will run until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
While Platini was forced to resign as UEFA president in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the clubs’ reckless spending.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's Chief Financial Officer, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract on a lump sum, it can write off the sum in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
As Neymar has signed a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be booked as an annual expense of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44,4 million over the next five years.
On the basis of the financial rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were issued in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million, which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the subsidy is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not count the subsidy as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could be financed through fees from the Qatar World Cup Organisation Committee 2022.
However, the PSG and the Organising Committee have denied that Neymar would be the World Cup ambassador, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to previous sanctions by PSG, UEFA is monitoring more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources who are aware of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity would not be disclosed because they had no authority to discuss the situation at PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the previous period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of clubwear and shirts.
The club estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30 percent as a result of the Neymar agreement.
Obviously annoyed by the departure of one of the best players in the world, the Spanish league tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," said Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sportsman.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of fair play. There are so many different interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
The coach of the Finnish World Cup athletes is stuck in Helsinki
Length jumper Arttu Pajulahden and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though she should be coaching at the World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualification and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump qualification.
Armenian coach Ghazaryan has not been granted a visa to enter the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British embassy without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Cup organizers as a document, but even that has not been accepted for obtaining a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successful in dealing with visas himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for many years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone in the stadium looks at the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said about his coach’s possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland from London demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics in London will begin on Friday and will last for a week until Sunday, 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the kinds of sports that Finnish benchesports are passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one high-ranking race to another, where experience is used to mature the athlete’s performance to the level that the World Championships for adults are truly possible.
Nowadays there are no such young athletes in Finland’s small World Cup team, and there are no such young athletes.
The World Cup for Finland demands a miracle.
Fortunately, the fascination and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to watch the races, even though the London medals are not decided until late in the evening due to the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by a spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Those who are brave are still waiting for Pitkämäki’s medal, even now, even though the recent results of him and other shooters and Pitkämäki’s qualifying at last summer’s high-value competition tell the other.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will be a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, entering the finals or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish athletics in the coming years will give us a good success in the international youth prize competitions this summer as well.
The breeding of young talents and financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite of representative athletes.
Success does not come instantly, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Let us hope that the London Games will go down in history as a match between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not, for example, as a result of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks.
Eenni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air competition in Colorado, USA.
The second place at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi’s best big air world cup.
The women's competition was won by American Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
On his last jump, he tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in a race, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and feels good right now, but I'm really sorry that the last jump didn't quite go.
I will try it again in the races from now on, Rukajärvi said.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jumper made for the sport.
Viking Line's new fast ship has left the harbour in Helsinki
Viking’s new FSTR has come a long way behind schedule.
The fast ship was due to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loading around eight o'clock.
The ship arrived late in Helsinki.
I've been waiting for at least an hour and a half to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving a little bit, said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian who is waiting to board the ship in the harbour of Helsinki, at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane suspected that the new ship had suffered a technical failure.
Rebane said the shipowner had brought water bottles for those waiting to board the ship.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there has been a technical failure.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours on the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn and return to Helsinki at 20.15.
42-Meter Special Transportation Disrupts Traffic on Sixth Street on Thursday Night
A 42-metre-long special transport will move from Muukko to Mustola harbour during Thursday evening.
Transportation at 9:00 a.m. is expected to arrive by 11:00 p.m.
Police control traffic on Route 6, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From Mälki, the transport proceeds along Route 13 to Mustola harbour.
Little Circle Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story echoes both the 80s glory days and the 90s grunge (at the time, David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant remembrance that we have stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems obsolete.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it was reported, among other things, as the background story of a vegetable can that spoke in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teens approaching the age of majority, and its emphasis makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parody 90s stalker movies, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs out an Apple Powerbook, inline skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Goodhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but has still not got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Ronald Reagan (also known as Michael Showalter) is an accomplice to George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such sets, the best are side paths.
It is especially fun to see Paul Rudd, an ever-young man with a razor under his lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles. Andy, the king of the camp, played by Rudd, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may bring this series to life as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it comes to its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the spirit of the Cold War in The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW rangers, where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, the series is a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a couple of police officers from Bucharest fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The starring characters are Gregor, Florin Piersic Jr., and Corneliu Ulici, whose lyrics have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on TV in the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in imitating a clumsy socialist drama – including the killer behind the Reagan mask, for example.
The six long episodes are too long, and the series’ humor is not fast enough or abundant.
To sum up, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby devouring burgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not mistaken: we ate our own recent history and theirs too.
Kouvola's Toni Tauru will rise to the ring in Macau on Saturday against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru faces a hard bone in Macau, where Brazilian Leandro Issa fought for the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has a black belt and a world championship.
For once, I'm fighting my own parent.
It's a funny story, says 32-year-old Tauru.
He was supposed to go up in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were quickly scheduled to take place in the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau.
Taurus has never faced such a thing before.
This is the first time my game has been cancelled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time has been set for the fight.
Waiting a week has little effect on the preparation.
The transplant doesn't work, because it doesn't improve in a week.
It can get worse if you practice too much.
Tauru has faced opponents in the last few battles, whose strengths are in standing.
This time the situation is different.
Issa Kouvola describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet in the first round he's gonna come on hard and try to take it to the rug.
He's won the jujutsu world championship, so he can wrestle.
The last game of the Kouvola did not go as planned.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon badly beat Tauro in the eye, and the victory was left to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially upright: he didn't get any hits.
When I left to pour, he hit my eyebrow.
It really upset me for a long time.
A New Motivation
Some freelance fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more often.
Issa, for example, last fought in September.
Taurus had three matches last year.
This year’s second battle is ahead.
Sometimes the pace gets pregnant.
I’ve been training for the past few years and I’ve been in good shape all the time.
I’ve only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We had a really good training with a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kouvola resident will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been trained against opponents of the same size and I have been trained in vertical matches.
Standing up is the 32-year-old’s main tactic.
You have to hit wisely.
If I get the chance, I’ll go to the store myself.
Low-cost exports should not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauro, who has previously fought in China.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think it will be a big and beautiful evening.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been depressed and the mitigation of inflation has stopped speculating on interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, with interest rate hikes shifted due to increasing pressure on family income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Commission voted 6–2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, a rate increase that was increasingly less supported this month due to the weak economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that household income levels would be under increased pressure as inflation is expected to continue to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation driven by Brexit, and the Bank said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more inexpensive funding to banks through the Scheme, totalling <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The Bank’s minutes of the interest rate decision state: “According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Commission, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the fall in households’ real income reduces consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" to contain inflation "a little wider than market expectations".
The market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be "steady" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now maintained its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent to USD 1.31, compared to the euro by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower-than-expected growth rates dampened higher expectations of interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the Bank says the situation will worsen before it improves.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the decline in income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to "significantly" recover at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound sterling, which will offset part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum result, which plunged the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision of the central bank, interest rate increases had become increasingly demanding as inflation tightened the pressure on households. Three decision-makers demanded an interest rate increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank, it was as expected and will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the exceedance of its 2% target was due to a "wholly" weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would seem to be intensifying as lenders are fervently seeking customers and wanting to close the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan contracts are coming to an end. Renewal contracts are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS Requires 10,000 Controversial HIV Drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed a "revolutionary" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court closed a dispute over the financing of the drug in the public health system (NHS) in England.
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Pre-intercourse medication has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year’s Supreme Court ruling, stating that the NHS could pay for the PrEP, although it argued that it should be financed by the local authorities.
NHS chief Simon Stevens called the decision a “significant new intervention,” and the National AIDS Organization described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept enrolments for a trial that will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full reach in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medicine taken before intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Taking the medicine before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection during intercourse.
It can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible candidates from men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and this week the NHS of England signed a procurement contract for medicines after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
“This major new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective ways we already have to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
“It’s another major achievement in over 30 years of fighting to solve one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is targeted correctly to those who need it and to those at risk, it can have a pivotal impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded experiment, which they can decide on their own use without the need to consult a partner. This will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a huge number of people.
This is welcome news.”
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left out," said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP drug used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection.”
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was unnecessarily delayed for several months due to the government's slowdown," Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister, said in a statement.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a pivotal impact on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: the middle floor and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Former banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anna-style house, and Joanne has not yet packed her bags and moved.
“I used to live here with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger apartment,” Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment screen here and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
“That was my demand,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was tasked with making use of the space of rooms nearly four metres high and creating an apartment that would not only be renovated and sold, but also a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor that could stand up.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
“Steel constructions are quite complicated.
The spaces had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right, both above and below them."
Erfan was able to overlap two full-height rooms with fascinating details.
Retrouvius’ copper-grid window opens in the middle floor for an elegant living area.
Mirror-shaped furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille’s vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
A mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view of another room.
Mirror-covered furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The kitchen can be hidden when it is not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what’s unique about Joanne’s kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of design," Erfan says about the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It is balanced, so it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With a rational use of space and storage space design, Joanne gained 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and an even better floor plan.
“When a property is sold, it’s the area that counts – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In the default case, the realtor walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by the use of high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The resident is in contact with the dwelling materials, and the emotional bond to the dwelling is partly based on them,” Erfan says.
"No one is attached to the power lines in the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good design and extra squares can make a basic apartment exceptionally exquisite.
It can also happen that you don’t want to move out of the apartment anymore.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiates in her summer look
Princess Sophia's dress was cute.
Princess Sofia was represented in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sophia was smiling at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B<0xC3><0xA5>stad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow at the seminar in a stunning blue body-shaped outfit that wore a beautiful dress to a pregnant princess at her finale.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event where Sofia represents her before her birth.
His scheduled date is September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress, which landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and an elegant little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess beautifully.
Sofia has been on a mission to B<0xC3><0xA5>stad in Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was radiant in her fresh summer look.
Sophia even started talking to photographers.
"Now I'm just holding my stomach," said Sofia, laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
He raises us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti Square, where Thai food was sold.
The Lahti people didn’t dare to taste it, they walked by.
At home the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the acquaintances Panja.
He didn’t speak much Finnish, and the Finns didn’t know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free samples.
This is how he taught the Lahti people to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got hooked on the lake.
I went out more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened its Thai restaurant in Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables. I think it had less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and have limited seats, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Little by little we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at the dish with a dictionary to learn Thai.
We spent two years in the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move because the spice pastes we made ourselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was vacated at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times we shyly have to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
He knows his customers.
They tell him where they have been and who they have seen.
He knows what each one eats.
He has seen how the life stages of the customers vary and the food company changes.
He remembers the name of the man with whom I ate my first spring rolls.
She remembers me skinny and fat, and she remembers what I was like when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange with Panja, who is leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened up not only our tastes, but also our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's a hard worker.
On top of restaurant work, he goes to mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating its two decades of fulfillment.
We got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any distraction or attention, this important day was spent at work.
Discovery of Underground Base Reveals 173 ISIS Terrorists Ready to Attack Europe
Earlier this year, the security authorities received a list of key elements of the fight against terrorism.
The list includes information on more than 170 ISIS fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data, but also photos of each person.
More than 130 of the figures on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been clarified.
Iraq's special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photos while investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials evaluated the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and photos of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person’s home country.
The list also lists the specialties of terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. appears on the list under the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012 to travel first to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Syria via Turkey to join ISIS.
Next to his picture is a suicide bomber.
There is no more precise information about the man's fate.
A total of 6,000 fighters have left Europe to join ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
Man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the rescue service, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning person's life.
A man was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire chief of the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was quickly over.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
Rescue service received a notification after 3:30 in the afternoon.

Brothers Fight for Over <0x24>500 Million in Real Estate
Two brothers are arguing about one of Victoria’s largest real estate empire worth over <0x24>500 million, a dispute related to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Colin De Lutis, former chairman of the Carlton Football Club and real estate developer, lives in the Torak value area just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has filed a dispute in the Supreme Court over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, jointly own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate assets when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family established the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for <0x24>85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about <0x24>316 million and Paul owns properties worth about <0x24>176 million.
Paul's not happy with the real estate and the money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was brought to the Supreme Court last Friday for the first time after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says the allegation isn't true, and he blames Paul for mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn statements that he would like to find a solution.
“In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me,” Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case continues to grow, with hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and gourmet shops in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the final years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons in a harmonious manner.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to go to court," Anna said in a statement.
The family's other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received <0x24>10 million and Luke <0x24>26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “bitter about the financial conditions of their departure.”
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this biography released in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and he said in his text that there's no way to comment on it, because it's going to be tried in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag my family’s name into a court battle,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
“Our father didn’t want us to argue like this,” Colin continued, saying that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
"We'll be tried in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff wants to restrict the president’s media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
The first.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict President Trump’s media use and news tracking so that the boss doesn’t get in trouble so often.
Reported by Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with executives on his first day at work, he brought up a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to restrict access to information by President Donald Trump.
“Kelly told White House employees that all information, whether printed or in briefings, must go through her because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump became upset about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media were more fair in handling things," Sam Nunberg, an advisor to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “six former campaign workers said it is essential that Trump’s use of Twitter is controlled by a steady stream of praise in his personal media stream.”
Yes, sir.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We’ll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing a riot.
Part of the problem is that there are competing factions in the White House that are trying to pursue their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their viewpoint. That information may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers deliberately provided the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on an incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can become furious with newspaper clippings that criticise him - especially if they report harmful leaks of information - so he must know where the information comes from.
That’s what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, an online provocateur founded by Charles C. Johnson, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later withdrew them, nor had he presented any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the article, Trump had begun asking the staff about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House personnel secretary Rob Porter “had tried to implement a system for managing documents going to Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own business.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly’s task extremely difficult.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract with PSG.
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday, it was reported that representatives of Neymar had paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to PSG.
The transfer amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, who paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million last summer for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying by hypnosis: "I'm fine in my life"
From the TV series The Time of the Rose and Pure White Bed sheets, well-known bestselling author Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold their grandmothers so tightly in their grasp, in addition to writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their houses, but this spring they also left a rental apartment.
In the light and in the sun, away from the old circles, Raija was once taken by depression and alcoholism, from which she has survived.
The exterior is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight began to drop when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-depressants.
Alcoholism was helped by hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
"Alcohol takes people away," the shining writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been together for more than 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made a major career as a writer, only remembers the 44-part Pure White Bed sheets TV series, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to work in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I acted as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
According to him, the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many scripts in the works - hundreds of ideas.
Across the ditch, the rovers returned to the 'millionaire alley'
One of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands is once again stranded with stubborn travellers who managed to cross a ditch dug by the municipality and return to the fields adjacent to the houses.
They parked around 20 caravans near a street called the millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross a ditch excavated by the municipality, bringing children, horses and an army of vans with them.
The visitors managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident said the rovers arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
“We need to get the city to act because it seems to be completely unable to solve the problem.
They were here in May, then they left, but they came back again.
“There were more of them tonight and probably more of them today.”
A resident said the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the rovers returned so soon after they were driven out.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even put a horse in a grazing park."
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihull said the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. “We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
When collecting evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to form an overall picture of the situation for judicial proceedings."
Angry People Surrounded Portugal's Crash Plane
The men who landed on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with death.
In Portugal, the maximum sentence is 16 years in prison.
A small plane flew by men had to make an emergency landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon yesterday due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran off into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man with his back on the plane.
Immediately afterwards, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, to the Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started hitting the back of it, according to Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the forced landing.
Finnish star who tragically lost her leg wins World Cup gold again: 'Without accident, I would not be world champion'
Early Wednesday morning Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated World Time gold at banked slalom in Big White, Canada.
In the past, Suur-Hamari won the Cross World Championships gold.
In total, three World Cup titles have already been won.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice gold was treated, with quite good heart rate pulled, Suur-Hamari reached by phone rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole paralum boarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
Differences are diminishing and there are a lot of new entrants involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
He lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been zealous with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take him to the slopes.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there's no point in siblings.
The cards that are dealt are played, says Suur-Hamari.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a kick of luck, and Suur-Hamari does not do that.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s biggest boarding passion was already fading.
It was only after the accident that the work started to really get to the top.
When I was young, I trained with guys, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the start of X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought it would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and pitiful.
I decided to put on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The rider was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion was awarded at a sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the parasports team.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly open your eyes to the parasports world.
When is it time to launch the Athlete of the Year campaign of the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see about that in due course.
I try my best to succeed.
Great Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he desires.
Next year we have a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We are going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees bake bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not expect to return to their home country permanently.
“The end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.”
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24 were surveyed, half of whom were women and half were men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents may think they are returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, young people’s decision to return home is mostly influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in returning permanently, while a quarter think that the most important thing would be to leave the country.
Only less than one-tenth of Syria’s economic situation or Bashar al-Assad’s departure from Syria is considered to be the main factor influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
Young Syrians were asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
Assad’s presidency is an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a fair quarter believes in solving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the power of ISIS weakened over the past year, while one fifth feels its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media should inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly as many of them preferred military measures and education reform as the primary means.
A fair tenth believes that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the conflict in Syria, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change under the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believes the conflict in Syria will worsen under Trump.
There are two opinions on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web in order – a database he developed is used by people like Wikipedia and Google.
The Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the “world’s fastest growing” open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data remain organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"Any information that is not in image format comes from a database, and images are linked there, too," Widenius explains.
Widenius, MariaDB’s Chief Technology Officer, spends about half of his time coding.
The man who works remotely from Kauniainen makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world’s most popular open source database, in collaboration with Swedish author David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for <0x24>1 billion, and a year later software giant Oracle devoured Sun for <0x24>7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, which didn’t make a sure promise for the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn’t want his life’s work to die.
I hired about 20 of Sun’s best developers and made sure that the continuity of the code is ensured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to oversee the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius regrets.
While many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion-dollar trading, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“Our growth rate has been around 50 per cent a year in recent years,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is very narrow on the company’s key figures.
He reveals that MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be more than a year’s work if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time, because they are versions of each other.
The Spanish operator Telefónica and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, among others, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections with the biggest gamblers.
"Our customers include some of the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks," Paqvalén said.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although, according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still negligible, albeit fast-growing.
With about <0x24>50 billion in the database market, open source databases do not reach even a billion.
However, the weight of open source software cannot be measured only in terms of money, as most users pay nothing for this software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for open databases at that time, or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies don’t get new customers because most people choose open source.
This has led to the licensing fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to make with fewer customers," Widenius says.
Due to the difficulty of changing the closed database, the majority of customer companies have obediently absorbed the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the size of the customers is getting full.
When licensing fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open-source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change their database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest ever EIB funding for growth in the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently,” says Paqvalén.
Widenius is annoyed about how in Finland, for example, money is wasted on closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot or cannot invent itself.
55-year-old Widenius, along with Linus Torvalds, another Finnish Linux developer, is one of the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on the basis of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches a year around the world on this topic.
Italy tightens its stance on NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
The Minniti warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which had only been operating for a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges against Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement.
“We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking boatloads of refugees on board directly from human traffickers who were able to re-use the boats.
One of these incidents is said to have occurred just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's report, which was published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as the Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the MOAS in Malta and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
He said on Thursday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, as they do not create "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that he plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected of killing his unmarried partner at Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case to prosecutor

The case may be heard in Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, from Harry Potter and My All-Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor’s death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also appeared in films and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for his role in the Harry Potter movies and his veterinary role in the television series My All-Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC’s popular series was filmed in seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and calling her to incite her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, serves 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at a hearing on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the sentence and was allowed to wait for the application to be examined on freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, listened to his judgment with his arms crossed with a weeping gaze on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the crime," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter’s attorney said the incident was “caused by shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that Carter's "age or maturity, and even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad’s mother, Lynn Roy, who said, “There is not a day that goes by that I do not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going to get through all this, and I'm going to do my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we're always going to carry."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she was "persecuted" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never goes away," Camdyn said.
The case seems to set a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that criminalizes incitement to suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it became clear that Carter had incited her boyfriend to commit suicide in her text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter should not take advantage of the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of the experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox article stating, “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO secretary-general: Russia has the worst ties since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
“I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg told CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid escalating the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump said the U.S.-Russia relations had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump urged the Congress to thank the two countries for their bad relations, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi is making changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to a setback for car manufacturers
The day before the announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW CEO said that the company believes that "there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions" and referred to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned a recall.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States has been heavily marketed by European car manufacturers in order to meet the CO2 emission targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralising devices are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of following the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices on the cars, which reduced emissions to comply with regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department of Audi was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and may be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emission standards. The charge was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela’s vote starts with fraud investigation, large demonstrations
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
"This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election results," Tibisay Lucenan, president of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro says the crisis will end
On Sunday, Venezuela elected a controversy council to amend the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised demonstrations against its modification.
The anti-Maduro opposition has postponed its own demonstrations to take place at the time of the nomination.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country’s national security forces began taking over the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The mission is to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender was decreasing due to drought and insects carrying diseases. Scientists and farmers are fiercely trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is directly endangered in the Provence region because it has been affected by the effects of climate change in recent years, which has resulted in a marked decrease in rainfall in the spring and especially in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the lifespan of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cascades into the area that spread microbes.”
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely absent," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer essential oil-containing parts."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing drought-resistant varieties.
Reporter's murder is a growing threat in Mexico
The editorial of the once-a-weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless war on drugs in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing safety because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: to leave the children at home or to bring them into the delivery of the bombing in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and feelings are sufficient.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make the news of Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, with 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. This year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
Among the most recent victims is Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, although he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture with Valdez showing his middle finger. The picture reads: "Right". Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, adorned with a smiling face of Valdez. Valdez has glasses and a branded panty.
The meeting takes place less than two months after Valdez’s death, and the journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up specifically to deal with journalists' cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalist murderers are rarely brought to justice, as are thousands of murders per year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Riodoce's journalists intend to continue to write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
“This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone until we know what happened.”
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in Culiacan on 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota just a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the Twelfth River.
The shooter drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two grown children.
Rumors move fast and roam freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is still a matter of silence.
Sinaloa has been Mexico’s bloodiest battlefield since Guzmán was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
In the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death every day, and in the cemetery there are decorative two-storey graves of drug lords that are larger than many households.
In a coastal state, it is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and leader, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce released an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival faction fighting Guzman's sons.
Guzman’s sons may have been upset: suspected gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it arrived at the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
She had survived so many that her friends and colleagues could no longer fear for her.
He had made a long career at Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to start Riodoce with five colleagues, selling the magazine's shares for <0x24>50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the journal that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists’ Freedom of the Press for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to go on with my life," he said when he was awarded the Journalists' Protection Committee award.
In Sinaloa, drug trafficking is "a way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A journalist must accept the task that falls upon him—or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when there was a death bath here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce’s staff miss Valdez – a joker who cursed like a docker. They miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we deal with their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug traffickers.
They were left out of the cases," Bojorquez says.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Confidence in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
Andres Villarreal, a Riodoce reporter, said: “The impression can be deceiving, and that’s what happened to Javier.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
It was not allowed to bring mobile phones into the room where Riodoce’s security training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been tracking activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from the heat of 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the reporters were half-joking about whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial scheduled three main cases.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The paper was also going to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's home town.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the D.A.'s office, had a group of people kidnapped.
There was no official information as to who had been abducted or how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in highly publicised cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, and in one of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would have given them reliable information about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed 'El Flaco' because of his slim physique.
"Now all connections to our information sources have been cut off."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a warehouse of signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists, and the newspaper’s employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left the next morning for a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office in response to another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacan three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which according to official DNA tests is Adama.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on the sidewalks and buildings during the demonstrations.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to gain international support for the Valdez case investigation.
The day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that his anger is unable to be objective.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, criminal permissive authorities and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were by the police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a letter signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for my writing."
Next to his cut off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate as Nuevo Laredo's El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page to the drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the entire country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you have to be on your guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after he had escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, at midnight on Friday, Riodoce’s journalists were sitting in front of the delivery with a beer on the sidewalk when the latest issue of the magazine was ready. Suddenly their phones started to color as a message.
A shooting between rival gangs and security forces at the beach resort of Mazatlan killed 19 people.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be rebuilt the next day.
Sirens roaring nearby – yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The editorial of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, in which the man shows his middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down the business. "How can I shut down the newspaper when our intern asked to go out and do the story the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, the celebration of Hannu Manninen, who turned 39, was short as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the rehearsal season began catastrophically when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
This was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted for almost five weeks.
The month of May was almost complete when I was sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a child’s disease, such as an ear infection, for which I had to take antibiotics.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can’t remember the last time I’ve been sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn’t take advantage of my training enthusiasm,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomi.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was granted a training licence only in the second week of June, which was reflected in the rolling mat test of the KIHU Research Centre for Racing and Top Sports on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis roller skis on a carpet, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the rug stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete’s fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only have 28 minutes.
It's against the wall, says Manny.
Towards a better direction
After the initial troubles, Manninen says she has remained healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to try to normalize the body’s metabolism.
It’s a really good five-week period.
Midsummer was also a week and a half off from flying.
I also had time with my family to visit the cottage.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup home games.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition, when Manninen reached the 18th place in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the national team’s head coach Petter Kukkonen have prepared a training and competition plan that runs until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm of training compared to last season.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have a weekend of three world cups.
In December, I would like to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, it is planned to be in Seefeld.
Hopefully the name will be on the Olympic team’s list, says Manninen.
The PyeongChang Olympics would be Manninen’s sixth winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela underline, who celebrated gold at the 2002 team competition in Salt Lake City.
Dinosaurs disguise to protect themselves from enemies
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have uncovered the first findings of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well-preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had been so well preserved that scientists were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to explore his discovery in more detail.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was excavated from a 1,100-pound rock.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you pinch your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum in Tyrrell.
It will enter the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Leather studies revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, although it was armored and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter color on the top, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend in with its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician from Borealope, who was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to excavate the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the pattern and shape of its body’s scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a common coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on the top and lighter on the bottom.
The observation was still a surprise, as the Borealopean is considerably larger than the current animals with a similar coloring.
This suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
Of the current animals, deer, zebras and armadillas, for example, have a similar coloration, they are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaur was also seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in nodosaurus scales reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions about its life, such as examining the contents of its bowels to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell in the river when it died and drowned in the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as Florida today, and the rivers and seas likely stretched far beyond what they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved and has also been preserved in its three-dimensional original form," Brown said.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
It doesn’t take much imagination to grasp it: if you squeeze your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping.”
The Cretaceous period was the age of theropods, huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopela, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
One of the predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex was the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of the Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armor from muzzle to hip.
Nodosaurs were an average length of five meters and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-meters of spikes rose from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore passed through Western Canada until a flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved to the smallest detail in the undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been so well preserved that its leather remains on the pitted plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull armor still has fossilized leather on its pitted plates.
Its right foreleg is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also count the scales on the sole of his feet."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Whose streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was shocked on August 9, 2014.
She had arrived in New York the day before from her home in St. Louis and was sitting in her airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on her phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets by <0x40>TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, a white police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user also posted a photo of Brown’s dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering at Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police locks and screaming people, and a man claiming to be Brown’s father, carrying a sign that read, “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell watched a real-time video of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video of a cop tuning his rifle and shouting, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell said.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we were used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried.”
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening, and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next almost three years has been documented in the documentary "Whose Streets?", which premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower dress and a matching crown, they re-discussed what it was like to live in black and under what conditions.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers telling his daughter.
“We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that’s not right.”
"I couldn't stop taking my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are...the culmination of past events.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow up in it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person, and he needs to know what we need to do to be free, to be free ourselves.
Even though I’ve been able to protect her from blatant racism, she’s still just like the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited to be informed of the case and finally learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the Association of Nursing Students from Minorities. At the time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabah Folayan, the documentary’s assistant director.
Folayan said that he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “simply wanted to tell us what was going on.”
Ferrell was sneaked into suspicion and asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times that people, usually white people, had appeared in the local community, who only wanted to take advantage of its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those who were born and raised in Ferguson did not have a voice in common," Folayan said in an interview recently. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals, and the shooting team followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how the local people are portrayed in the movie because I’m being portrayed in the same way.”
According to Mr Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about the community".
That’s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as he tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats and re-focuses the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (<0x23>BlackLivesMatter) after police shot and killed a black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among which there are a lot of queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary because of his "self-intentional" queer identity.
"He made the energy move," Folayan says.
"However, it's no coincidence that she was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police remains tense.
Ferrelli still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking a highway during a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political climate of his home corner is brief and concise: "The mess."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned from the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can do is lose our chains."
Artist Creates Portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has hung faces in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces, with similarities between them.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning’s cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served a 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology, and art. Manning is a trans woman and a pioneering dissident whose jail sentence Barack Obama relaxed on the third and final day of his term in office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning’s DNA algorithmically and based on his genetic data, he created 30 portraits. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement on the modifiability, ambiguity and causality of DNA data, and the identity behind the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since adolescence. She was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, including espionage law violations, computer fraud, and theft.
There was only one photo of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie with Manning sitting in the driver's seat and wearing a platinum-white wig that became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a successful Stranger Visions project in 2015, which she completed in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, including DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gums, and he created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference.
He was unable to visit Manning and could not be photographed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his captive muse suddenly became friends in correspondence, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-wrote a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which portrayed a future where the president would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and she would be able to see the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the release of the comic book, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas City.
It’s also impressive that the show is opening right now as Donald Trump wages his own war against leakers and transgender soldiers and invents new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divisions that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is an artist's statement and underneath it is Manning's large autograph, in which the point of the last name is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "the automatic division based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist’s scientific definition goes – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least in our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal from our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning’s character rises out of prison like King Kong with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can shut you down, they've won," says the picture.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold flushes."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the show, and when Manning arrives, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic knowledge, like a group of protesters in the middle of the showroom.
It’s intentional, like everything else in this show: for example, Manning’s DNA episode is written on a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg says.
“I wanted to capture the mass movement that Chelsea was creating and that was behind her release.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee on suspicion of murder
Police have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court documents, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police who were alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts on his body.
According to authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stab is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the University’s Vice President for Public Relations, said in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University will help with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email: “We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the U.S. authorities investigating the case in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Information Officer of the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly refining our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had received a vague indication that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as awful.
According to Guglielmi, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras had revealed that Lathem and Warren had been inside the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza executive team released the following statement to the residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the convict told the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and “kill all Muslims.”
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of harassment.
According to police, the staff of the bookstore alerted them on 23 May.
He said he had threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after being threatened.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police for threatening him.
The threat was not related to the bookstore's events.
Authorities found Moffatt wore the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” Moffatt told police.
As a punishment, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>690) in legal expenses and <0xC2><0xA3>85 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>95) in compensation to the victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said several hate crimes were not reported.
"We will complete WADA Roadmap actions in the near future" – Vitaly Mutko, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia
Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete actions in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the measures under the Roadmap have already been implemented and RUSADA has been granted the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA Roadmap has been updated on these aspects," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the re-establishment of the mandate of RUSADA, and the second part of the Roadmap was recently published on the WADA website.
It does not contain anything that is of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
One of the points on the roadmap, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of a WADA-ordered study by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the state’s alleged involvement in Russian sport doping.
Mutko said: “The research is underway because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes, and we cannot admit what did not exist."
The statements of the president of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission, Vitaly Smirnov, were echoed in the words of Mr Mutko.
Speaking to the Russian sports media RSport earlier that day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with the Russian anti-doping institutions. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered Rusada to end its anti-doping controls in Russia in November 2015, after the scale of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July, after which he said the organization was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of Finland’s beloved innovation: There is “no evidence” of the health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and The Guardian, among others, say the Lullaby Trust, which fights sudden deaths, bans the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
Distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packages reduce the risk of sudden death.
Sudden death is the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert on safe sleep for children in the UK.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, a good reading in Finland is the result of a variety of reasons, including the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that there is a box for each family there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for certain," Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and sudden deaths.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package includes various accessories, such as children's clothing.
There are 53 products in the package this year.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends using the pack only for naptime and stop using it as soon as the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and making sure they don’t get wet or get dirty.
A fast-paced villain escapes from a Japanese zoo for the second time.
The staff of the Japanese zoo is looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn't die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is a female, weighing 55 kilograms and about a meter in length.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely on the grounds.
The zoo hasn't had any eyewitness sightings of a turtle.
The last escape of the villain took place last week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
"I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Can Help Your Business Avoid Uber Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured me that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new kinds of HR startups have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can make surveys and target specific teams and population groups, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, a direct link to the board bypassing senior management.
“Your health can be monitored with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for companies?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint Startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years and says he has gained a deeper understanding of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program allows quick surveys and voting for specific teams. It also allows you to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfaction with employees and which managers have the lowest ratings, which has allowed Errett to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have realised that they need to follow the workplace culture to not become the next Uber. The transportation company has been in turmoil around since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate Governance, Regulation and Compliance is a global industry that could reach more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Based in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent improper behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year after Uber’s reputation suffered a hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to make tailor-made surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of improperness, complaints go directly to the board of the company.
“Public opinion has overrun the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He reminds us that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily access the headquarters.
Previously, it was practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out a phone number or email address to be able to file a report with the headquarters. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Chief Legal Officer at Ruby Tuesday. According to him, the complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems were hidden from managers working in another city or state, but now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I’m getting a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of employee reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies became more serious about ethics, values, and employee engagement after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical behavior in the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly cleared.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by private equity investors. Both Glint and Convercent have private equity investors to support them.
In February, Convertent raised <0x24>10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of <0x24>47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that workers expect more from their workplaces.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the success of a company if they feel comfortable in the company and feel listened to and rewarded by their work,” said Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn, Employee Compensation and Welfare.
Investors get returns when companies are successful. Companies are successful when employees are engaged.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they’re of interest to investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn’t come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies rely too much on mere gathering of information.
"If the company does not take action, employees will begin to wonder whether they were consulted
Does their opinions matter?
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly personnel surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees about the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve long-term employee retention in an industry known for its high employee turnover.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers, there is no business.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of stealing his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home when she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a rope outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone was filmed in the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the incident, ran into another room to dress.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but dropped back into the window shortly afterwards.
A 20-year-old man has admitted to photographing a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman’s face.
The video was removed and the police were unable to return it as evidence.
During the interrogation, the man admitted to the crime but denied having committed it.
The man he described was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor "just crazy."
According to the news agency TT, the man will be charged with the case.
Teachers call for more funding in autumn talks
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of OAJ, said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holidays highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility of concluding agreements that do not include in any way the holiday allowance cuts that have been made.
In the municipality sector, contracts are likely to be concluded only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase rates are known.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions will be agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been announced.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the public sector trained negotiating body Juko.
Luukkainen: Holiday allowance cut increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, temporary holiday allowance cuts will further sharpen the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be determined.
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the disparities between those who do best and those who do less well are constantly increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining and disparities between pupils and regions are constantly growing.
Bruins Players Day Extended as NCAA Reduced Daily Exercises from 2 to 1
It’s almost eleven o’clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have stayed on the other side of the campus to talk to the new training ground.
Some of them have taken off their shirts and their backs are shining in sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of us, this is a noon break.
After three hours of rehearsals, the students return to the dorm for their final exams. The next morning, they meet at the Wasserman Football Center at half past seven.
“The next three days are going to be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday’s shift to Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organisation reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The change was intended to reduce the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three rehearsals started after 7:15 p.m., and it was hard to find room for the players already on the full schedule.
The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in Mora’s six-season Westwood coaching season that the training takes place at the same time as the summer courses.
The rehearsals are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will meet Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change, although it made the timetables for the players even tighter.
“We’re putting a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great guys.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday, so we'll have more time.
UCLA closes rehearsals to outsiders after the camp. It’s not easy, given the direct view from the rehearsal fields to the adjacent parking lot and Lusk Center, a luxurious hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goal post.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora said.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film the exercises from there on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the rehearsals is paid a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
In Central African Rwanda, presidential elections will be held on Friday, the winner of which is already clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
It was then that the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics.
Kagame will run for a third term because the constitution limited to two terms of the presidency was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in unifying a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
Kagame, however, has promised his people more freedom after the country has been lifted up.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact-checking
Facebook will increasingly send fake news to independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article, the world’s largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news, and many believe that the fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has emerged into political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election, and Germany, preparing for the September election, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hateful content.
In a separate statement published in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was trying to verify facts in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass through the screen of independent reviewers. They also want more background information so that they can decide more informedly what they read and share," Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News Feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottney Castle in County Kent is now known for the music video of Squeeze and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
With 700 years of turbulent history, this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is now the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who is fond of old documents.
"I'm delighted to be able to study a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes said.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes’ first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed the thumbprint in the letter, which was written by a dual agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
“That was his fingerprint.
And the letters smelled like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he is on the spot.
I love the archives!
With the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, the author, who was attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles in the trench for centuries.
He toured the ruins and farms of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes even illustrator artists.
In the evening, he "takes a whiskey and starts writing."
Scotney's recent history is rather unknown, as the castle was not fully transferred to the National Trust until after the death of her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation’s staff was just beginning to search the archives, and Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything else to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes were boring," Rhodes says. "But here families fought even for one birch.
I thought I should let it go.”
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man joining the English peasant rebellion shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant rebellion in England began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
“Maybe these events are related?”
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest that Darrell’s family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have framed his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (which was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The men of the family seem to have been quite a bunch of crooks. They were constantly in debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who were able to groom the heirs."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium that operated in the early 20th century, from which only a eutrophied plot remains.
Scotland Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to this damn thing.”
Russia is the worst since the Cold War.
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
“I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg told CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid escalating the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump said the U.S.-Russia relations had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump urged the Congress to thank the two countries for their bad relations, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko is out of a rematch with Anthony Joshua
Vladimir Klitschko, longtime world heavyweight champion of professional boxing, ends his career.
Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Klitschko won 69 gold medals as a professional.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in a knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
Klitschko, however, did not find any motivation for the match.
"I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful career in boxing.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitschko's reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitschko’s manager, Bernd Bönte, said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, who was born in 2014.
Klitschko's big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the two brothers managed the World Cup titles of different unions simultaneously.
Finland's weather wrecker witches conditions: "Take the feel"
The pole jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkasen has had problems with her circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman away.
The World Cup in London is under unstable conditions.
Nikki talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been this summer against pole jumper Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn’t get even the small poles moving properly,” Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I’ve competed and practiced here for who knows how many times and I’ve never experienced a wind that varies in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the rehearsals," Nikkanen said at the Kaleva races.
The weather was in London on Thursday.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology back together - is it cold soda or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the heat away.
It makes no sense to consume energy in poor conditions.
He made his way to the World Cup with his 455.
445 has gone outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday’s qualifying.
Why don't you move overseas to train?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology standardized.
I should have done the same now.
Normally, he has been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
Twenty-five degrees.
A little wind, as long as it's constant.
Ex-officer: “We have no margin for division now or for many years”
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep ice in its hat and beware of inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
According to him, there is no dividing margin.
Yle interviewed Virta, who had retired in 2015, in the First Morning of Wednesday.
The state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ proposals to raise the guarantee pension, lower the car tax and support e-bikes, among other things, are considered election speeches by Virtanen.
They mainly tell us that elections are coming close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no distribution margin now and for many years.
I think it’s even deceitful to talk about a distributor thief when you take out debt,” Virtanen told Yle.
He stressed that all debt is owed to the children.
Virtanen has long experience in the preparation of state budgets: in 1978 he joined the Ministry of Finance as a budget secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Budget Manager.
Before his last retirement, he served as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the 3% growth forecast now is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike that we will start going down as early as next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington to change permanent residence permit rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump has announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English, are able to support themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The Queen of Denmark doesn’t want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband, Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side.
Traditionally, pairs of monarchs in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried at Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, this is due to the Prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
"It's no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, the court's communications chief, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse’s wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: A car was coming up on the highway
Tommi had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanporti in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her unmarried partner Riina and the couple’s two small children were driving on the motorway near Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the junction of Ring III to Hämeenlinna bus, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was about to drive to the side of the family’s car, Tommi says.
Without it, the car would have gone with Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
The parents and the two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is slightly under 3 years old, the other is less than one year old.
Apparently it was pretty good luck that nothing happened to us.
No one passed by even drove towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel came to the scene and the condition of the family was checked.
The car was redeemed.
Tommi says that he and his unmarried partner have low incomes, and they received a family grant for the purchase of a car a couple of years ago.
Without the data of the other car, according to Tommi, the family will not receive any money from the insurance.
That’s why the family wants witnesses to find the car that caused the family to run on the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take the children to the nursery and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He said the car’s license plate was a SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're going to make it financially, we're going to have to count every cent nowadays.
Tommi hopes that anyone who has seen the incident or knows something about it will contact the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
The headline and the article were corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally said in the article, the other car did not come into the lane of the opposite lanes, but was driven from the acceleration lane to the side of the family’s car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with interpersonal relationships through humor - The Self-Exhibitor will be seen in the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first directing to the What? Theatre.
A self-exhibitionist is a musical theatre performance of misguided relationships and inadequacies.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is dealt with with humor.
You don’t have to worry about feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to think about what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he playing a role, or is he approaching someone with his jacket open?
Confusion of Fact and Fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation is composed of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that although the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that Self-Exhibitor does not directly tell about his or her personal relationships or the working group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my values will be conveyed by the show.
I don’t think that relationships are bad, but I don’t think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many Learn From Divorced Parents
Jäppinen believes that Self-Exhibitor draws an up-to-date picture of young adults living in a 100-year-old Finland.
He says that many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
The arrangement of the music is Jäppinen and Rokka.
Love for the theatre was sparked in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying theatre expression at the Art Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's two years back and another mess in front of me.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
He has been an assistant to the Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the Ylioppilasteatteri in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnatheater in Turku.
Guidance is becoming more and more interesting.
The self-proclaimer premiered last week in Helsinki on Narr’s stage.
The 45-minute performance is expected to be performed in Turku, at least in the student town of Jäppinen.
Self-exhibitionist Kouvola What? Theatre on 4.8. at 7 p.m. and 5.8. at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers a year after a terrible motocross accident - neck spine broken
Few athletes in Finland have an unstoppable force of nature like Janne Lahtela.
The ace of backcountry skiing toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There aren’t many sports on earth that a chemist hasn’t tried at least once.
It inspires me to practice.
There’s always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both arms were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
“I’ve been licking wounds in my home for a year,” Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that his age may have played a part in the accident.
Driving can sound wild.
But I didn't use it to push boundaries.
It's just so hard as a sport, it's not worth a 40-year-old doing too much!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a strange situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the post right after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
During his training, Lahtela often challenged his protégés at slopes and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that even my own thoughts didn’t make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be still.
I really enjoyed it because for once, I really enjoyed it.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It’s easier to find places that are broken than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I traded motocross for frisbee golf!
It got out of hand right away.
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer, he does not require his trainers to be like him.
I'm not gonna make everyone do the same thing.
In our culture, there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex Robots Are Coming and We Should Be Concerned
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just when it started to feel like 2017 couldn’t get any weirder.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
"We need to start taking the proliferation of sex robots seriously," said Noel Sharkey, co-founder and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are being cheered, but they’re already selling quite a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, ranging from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
What’s even more worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, shy.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is as fully adapted as possible to the personality of the user,” the company’s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
You may be tired, or “in that mood.”
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots. They replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies as the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be shy and resistive.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development tells of something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people start acting strangely or offensively only when the market allows it.
It’s no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women’s rights are under threat around the world and there is a president sitting in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
The TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most disturbing of its powerful visual language, such as images of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
They try to make sex robots as much like real women (with pornstar proportions) as technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as much as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will of their own, no history – nothing that suggests independence or violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, a group led by ISIS chief
The leader of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men who are suspected of planning to take a bomb onto an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of ISIS had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted prior to security checks.
The police have not yet explained why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas emitting device and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist attacks, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation continues.
The good side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
During Trump’s term, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that the strong division of voters at the level of everyday life has also broken up families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory boards of American newspapers were instructed on how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin visited me in New York this week, and he's a Chicago-based leftist poet who's long had a fight with the Republicans in our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousin’s acquaintances – including his Republican sibling, with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but in a broader sense, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new impetus, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
“When we talk about Trump and ‘normalization’, we’re talking about the frightening possibility that one day we’ll no longer be able to dread his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the far-right Republicans, which suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I recall with sadness Mitt Romney’s subtle version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least his tax returns we’ve seen). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When Trump’s term is over, the Republican’s next presidential candidate just needs to be sane, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park Carousel, which is the largest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best New York City can get for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses on the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and terrified animals looking behind them – are ominous, and the squealing music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s hallmarks become disappointing over time: the views from the tall buildings start to bore you, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city’s reality doesn’t match its dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven’t completely overcome the fact that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big traffic circle in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub, but it doesn’t count.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still an oddly magical experience – to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but luckily no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to rate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reader.
The same thing happens in a cafe in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the estimate with a 15% service fee when I myself go to get the coffee at the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service agent to put his/her personality into play in a situation where he/she is not needed.
The store saleswoman smiled with apologies when I gave my credit card five stars for the user experience.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter: “There was no trust in the management”
FC Inter has released Shefki Kuqi from his role as coach.
Fabrizio Piccareta, former assistant coach, takes responsibility for the training.
The rest of the team will continue in its current role.
Picareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old Picareta, who joined the Inter coaching team in January, has passed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club’s management, so now there was no other choice,” H<0xC3><0xA5>kans said in a statement.
The Piccareta agreement will remain in force until the end of the period.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he will be responsible for tomorrow’s home game against HIFK.
According to reports, the team has been in turmoil throughout Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told players that his assistant coaches, Picareta and John Allen, had been dismissed.
Kuqi and Piccareta had a tough fight against PS Kemi in the Inter match last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several disturbances have been added to the image, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself marvels at the young woman who is looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he sent a message.
If you can't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she is now posing as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders that he suffered when he was younger.
20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and how I look.
After the text, she had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating crooks in previous years.
At the age of 14, he was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia.
He also developed bulimia, which was not revealed until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampeni was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison officials, he suffered after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp early on Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius’ six-year sentence to be too mild.
The State Prosecutor will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will probably be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius's sentence can be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the foreign ministry said on bTV.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally camped people in Sithonia were arrested by the police, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to bTV, the foreign ministry later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone who camps outside the designated areas.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry announced that the court could impose a fine.
Liquid share sinking - already sunk -7.7%
The share of oil refiner Neste has plummeted by 7.7 per cent around 11 a.m.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like digestive nightmares.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to study leader Marco Colonna, the immune cells guard the bowels and make sure that no harmful microbes hidden in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen resistance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The experiments showed that immune cells that strengthen tolerance were found in mice that had a certain bacterium in their intestines.
Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins, and it is essential for the development of immune cells.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal intestinal microbiome," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan in the diet of mice, the more immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
Researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, a postdoctoral researcher on immune cells that strengthen immunity, found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not have them in mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiome of mice, the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When examining the intestinal DNA of mice, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was given to mice that grew up in a sterile environment and did not have a gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they started to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of liquid —without the bacteria— to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into resilience-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was cleared from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthened tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects related to tryptophan have been observed in people with IBS.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate the inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their proliferation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United won a "genius" after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic, who made his midfielder debut with Manchester United in a game against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United's last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in his best shape yet, as he did not participate in the Blue Shirts Asia Tour before the start of the season, and he only managed to make it on the pitch for 45 minutes – Mourinho says that this will have to change before the start of the Premier League season.
“She needs time, but her experience, intelligence and mindset make her a genius – she has the innate ability to think football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began filing his initial line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" of getting three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four - we have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women harassed Germany for two sets
The Finnish women's national volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualification to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German standard of play is high.
Their game was even in every sector, Finland’s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents in a tight spot, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to swing along, Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective player was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Three out of four matches losing, Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand Jury Already Sends Challenges to Trump Jr.’s Russia Meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent out challenges in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin affiliation.
The news agency Reuters confirms the Wall Street Journal’s announcement on Thursday that a grand jury will be convened.
According to Reuters, the Grand Jury has sent out challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for his Kremlin affiliation, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr.’s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House’s current advisor, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the convening of a grand jury in Washington by special prosecutor Robert Mueller is a stepping stone to the investigation of Russia.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help investigate Russia’s interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his close circle cooperated with Russia on the matter.
The Grand Jury expands Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, send subpoenas, and force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The Grand Jury weighs the evidence found by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether to prosecute the case.
British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a handshake
The British inventor is the first in the country to microchip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who now provides a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam’s BioTeq company.
Northam collaborates with an anaesthetist Geoff Watson of the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical standards.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchip used in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also makes house and car locks compatible with the microchip. The handling of one lock costs <0xC2><0xA3>300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
Last month's White House decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the south of the White House for an American production event cost taxpayers <0x24>24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, known as the Marine One when the president is on board, was the main attraction of an event at the White House on 17 July 2017 to introduce American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had ordered the helicopter to be taken to the site by a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as documented by the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email the day before the incident to his superior, the deputy commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn on 17 July at 7:00 a.m. and the event would start at 3:00 p.m. The helicopter would not leave the site until after the grass field was cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter was delayed to leave the White House, a second crew would be needed due to service hours restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit’s security personnel were with the helicopter while it was on the ground.
The documents received by TIME magazine do not show whether another crew was needed in the end.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the incident violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to be violated," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of health care reform and looser state regulation, which was discussed by the Senate at the time.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One helicopters for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them in their travels.
But using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions sparked attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor’s presidential airplane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which introduced products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states," White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
The crews of the HMX-1 regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train in the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House in centimeters.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day in “non-presidential support missions.”
The White House said there were no additional costs for taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in the demonstration of the helicopter on the southern lawn of the White House.
The HMX-1 has no records of flights related to Presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Department of Defense’s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for a VH-3D helicopter is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is significantly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs which are taken into account in the annual budget."
According to a study conducted by RAND research company in 2015, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security, and that they are likely to employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to point that out.”
It is unclear whether Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the seat of the driver of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning strikes Vaasa railway – trains must be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is interrupted due to a technical failure, the Railway Transport Centre reports.

Venezuela’s Prosecutor Calls for Court to Prevent Appointment of New Representative
Venezuela’s prosecutor has requested a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of a new delegate.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the elected assembly is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected, which could, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said he had asked for a blockade decision on suspicion of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an election fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the vote said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million more than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the congress, and the elected congress has 545 members, including Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the Congress can dissolve the Congress led by the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro described as dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the reform of the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have said they will not recognise the new council.
Maduro argues that the new Congress is the solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
Unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Several people have been wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela plunged into economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now, many people can’t afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to protest on Friday, when a new representative body is scheduled to begin.
Russian man handed over by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison
A court in Minneapolis on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the U.S. judiciary in February 2016, despite Russian protests, AFP said.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had profited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry reproached Finland after its arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticized for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
The prosecutor said Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to phishing usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further redirect internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Vice President of the Justice Department’s Crime Department, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing cybercriminals in other countries.
“We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.

The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons of the series will be shown. The trailer for the third season has been released and presents the new villains of the series.
In the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional light artwork in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (in the picture) will perform an exceptional light artwork in Paris next year, on 16 May, to commemorate the first day of light set by the UN.
Kola makes a light artwork in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters in Fontenoy and the Globe Monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I feel important to be concretely visible,” says light artist Kari Kola about her work.
I am very honoured to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art as part of the theme day,” Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she illuminated the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the celebration.
I feel very privileged to be able to perform my art again at UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work could be expanded significantly.
We will announce this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris on 16 May.
Two men fight in a shopping centre parking garage in Espoo

He admitted in his initial speech that he caused the damage and that he had done the wrong thing.
Timo Soini's question mark titled: "After that came the Flood"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini published a blog post titled with a question mark.
The text is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven members of the government party.
Then came the Flood, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
There are references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases “a flood after us” or “a flood after me” have remained in the history books.
Afghan Democracy Depends on the Political Role of Women
The election will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in it, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Relief Mission, said hundreds of women are running for regional council elections, three women are running for vice-president, and more than 30% of the newly registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats to the elections at a time when international forces are shifting to an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the contribution of women strengthens democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The locals are particularly angry at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: you are only a few hours away and rush through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is suffocating with tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while their homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems brought by tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, the time is given two or three hours.
You will follow the flag-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, says Dario Franceschini, Minister of Culture of Italy, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice's historic centre.
St. Mark's Church is located on the outskirts of the square.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 people live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has reduced their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven out residents.
Approximately 2,000 residents leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
“It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster,” said Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the ships provide Venice with the earnings it so desperately needs and create a need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is that the cruisers should move further away from the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice every year.

Bad kilometre-long traffic on the motorway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the lane heading north has had kilometres of traffic at the time of return traffic from Thursday afternoon work.
The area is undergoing highway paving work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For roadworks, there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120 km/h speed.
In the 50-kilometre restricted area, however, traffic had progressed at walking speed in some places on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, the roadworks proceeded on the side of Siilinjärvi at the statue of Revelation, i.e. the golden deer.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has noticed publicity curses.
Amalie Iuel has published amazing photos of herself, including in the Grand Canyon landscape.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current homeland, Norway, not least because in March she broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record in 400 metres by turning 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 m hurdles in the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Shortly after his records, Iuel, a hard-working social media user, discovered that celebrity and publicity had their downsides.
Men from all over the world began sending photos of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
He was forced to close his Snapchat account.
“I received a lot of ‘scratch shots’ from strangers, so I was forced to make my account private,” Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can guess, Ian laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after the race, but I get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of her father’s work.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
He spent four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask questions, they just give orders.
"In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to deal with the athlete personally," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in the 400 metres and the 400 metres hurdles.
Foot injury puts snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career at stake - now participating in the World Championships: "It's nice not to hurt anywhere"
It's been nice to count now that nothing's happened!
One of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, Janne Korpi, 31, has once again enjoyed her beloved sport this season.
Last summer, his career was at stake.
The foot injury had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal.
His hand had hit him in the groove.
During the summer, I didn’t know what to do, whether to continue or not.
The sponsorship deals were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw again to the slope.
The decision was then easy.
I knew that when I first walked in the snow.
I thought, hell, this is so much fun, let's do a couple more times.
Korpi was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long hiatus, it has been a big deal just to work out without pain.
The races have only been run by a few.
It's okay. It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you get a fever for that week.
I can't think of it like that, Corbyn says.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though he doesn’t like to go on board in individual races, he always gets caught up in a hard-to-competition race.
According to Korpi, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
This is a big game, the visibility is big.
In my opinion, however, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s kuopas, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger.
It’s nice to see younger friends.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
It's bringing a new stream to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on the slope somehow, but otherwise I don't, there's so much power in the guys!
Behind his boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built another kind of sports career.
Pekka Korve’s son is addicted to racing: the rider has his own racing horses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the results of the race and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korpi, racing and nutritional coaching are potential career plans when the boarding career is completed in due course.
I don’t plan that far, but at least it’s a good option.
I feel like I’m studying it alongside snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep up with the time and develop, maybe in the summer I'll run some kind of exit.
If that’s my future profession, then it’s not hard to get started when you’re already inside the sport.
Ravi stories also include the Elitloppet raviri cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that is headed to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet Race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well and people have been very excited.
We are now at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
We still have a few more months, hopefully we can fill the ship, Korpi says with excitement.
Attendo’s nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-seat nursing home to be built in Kitee.
The 1,700-square-metre building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of Terveystie, a neighbouring health centre.
The common question at Kitee is where the new care unit will have enough customers, because now, during the Siu Wars, many private care homes are in short supply.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendanta, commented that in the future there will be more demand for Kitee not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Last year, Attendo bought the private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee.
The transaction was about business, but there is a five-year lease agreement for the properties.
Flink says there is no acute need for Attendo to move functions away from these spaces.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie’s factory in Scotland
The union seeks confirmation from McVitie's directors of its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish section of the British General Trade Union GMB, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, has more than 500 employees.
The company, which owns the McVitie’s brand, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives would be "certainly told first" if there were any changes to the operation.
In a letter to the head of the factory, GMB urges the company "to address the concern that no funding has been allocated to the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union is extremely concerned that the factory manager does not provide clear information on Tollcross’ business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, which is a major source of employment in areas with high unemployment and low livelihoods.
“From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising living costs and continuing cuts in production, eastern Glasgow is in desperate need of successful McVitie’s production.”
According to a Pladis spokesperson, the factory manager had received the trade union letter only the day before, and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross two months ago, where we discussed openly a number of issues.
Among other things, we talked to our employees about how, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and locations to maintain our competitiveness.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and operational improvements.
"We are aware of Tollcross' long history as a manufacturing facility and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to the operation of the plant."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Compare
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar’s pursuit after paying <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to terminate the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about case of the summer. The team of the French Ligue 1 football league is ready to break the world record for transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be outraged by PSG’s actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source near Barcelona says that the club has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the world of football about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we'll be their opponents and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to be guilty of just that: it expressed its interest in PSG midfielder Marco Comparatti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

Trump's phone calls were made up - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s phone calls to both the Mexican president and the leader of the scout organization have proven to be fictional.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said no calls had been made.
He said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the Scout leaders spoke to Trump in person, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
"These conversations took place, not just on the phone, but face-to-face," Sanders said.
Speech to the Scouts aroused resentment
On Monday, Trump said the Mexican president called him and praised him for successfully eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will cross Mexico’s southern border because they know the journey will be a hitch to the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday stating that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a large meeting of the National Scouts in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scout boys, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the group said it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the statement, the organization’s chief Michael Surbaugh’s earlier statement, in which he apologized to the Scouts for Trump’s speech, speaks for itself.
Trump’s speech at the Scouts’ meeting raised a lot of surprise, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of the presidential election last autumn.
