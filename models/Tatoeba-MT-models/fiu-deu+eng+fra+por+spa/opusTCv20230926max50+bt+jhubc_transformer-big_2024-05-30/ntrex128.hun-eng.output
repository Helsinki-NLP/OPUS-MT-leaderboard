Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will find themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after it was raised that the National Assembly should be called the Welsh Parliament.
Now MEPs from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title may make them the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that their new name would rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple, and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid party, the whole faction is “dissatisfied” and therefore proposes alternatives.
One Conservative MEP said his group was “open” for a name change, however he noted that the MWP was just a leap from “Muppet”.
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as in Yorkshire English the letter "u", i.e. MWP pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee, which is responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change, is as follows: “The final decision on the titles for the nomination of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members of Parliament.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 made it possible to change the name of the Welsh National Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to name the Welsh Parliament, which received broad support.
Regarding the address of the Members, the Commission prefers the title Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation preferred the MWP alternative.
MEPs have come up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather cumbersome, which is a problem for National Assembly president Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including disqualification of Members and committee structures.
MEPs will be able to vote final on their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on whether to change the country’s name to “North Macedonian Republic” on Sunday.
The aim of the referendum is to end a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial claim and has repeatedly objected to its application for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the name change and is therefore not taking part in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that must be made for their EU and NATO accession.
Harlem Churches in Difficult Situation, St. Martin's Bells Silent
“In the past, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“None of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“People are socializing differently nowadays,” he says.
“Bars aren’t the common living rooms that people go to every day.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not fulfill the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will be back where they started.”
In the place of the churches, he adds, there will be residential buildings, the housing community of which will not help the fate of the remaining churches either.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and this will further hasten the permanent closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these buildings will join the community."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a city of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin’s Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for leading a boycott of shop owners in Harlem’s shopping street, 125th Street, who refuse to employ blacks or sell black products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell was built to the order of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Reverend Johnson at St. Martin's Parish, proudly referred to the bell as "the bells of the poor."
According to the expert who played the bell in July, the bell is “a cultural heritage, an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance”.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first bell to be played in the world by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who joined the larger bell to be played at Riverside Temple 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin has not hired anyone to replace him.
In recent months, a complicated situation has developed in St. Martin with the participation of architects and contractors, who have been involved in part in the secular leadership of the church and partly in the office of bishop.
In July, the parish council, the governing body of the parish, turned to the bishop’s office in writing, objecting that the office would “transfer the costs” to the council, although the council was not involved in selecting the architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain of a lack of transparency in the office.
Shark attacks 13-year-old boy in California while fishing for crab
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while fishing for crab on the opening day of the crab season on Saturday in California.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported on KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy crying for help, and he drove over there with several of himself to help him climb out of the water.
Hammel at first thought the boy was just excited because he caught a crab, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“His shoulder was torn by his clavicle,” he told Hammel what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water.’”
The boy was transported by air ambulance to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of the shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the press that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for safety reasons.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s expands to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert salespeople and wholesaler style piper stands with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of its growing <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, the chain is testing larger piper stands in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will be added to new stores next year.
The strengthening of the toilet line is due to the fact that department stores try different ways to replenish the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offering to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it offers for the first time.
But the previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be located in a larger area at brand-name booths such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain is also relaunching the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan – these are nowadays increasingly sought after by young customers.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its presence at two Sainsbury’s stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online shopping and the shift of grocery shopping habits to small local stores, big stores need to make greater efforts to lure buyers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said the offer would be more and more similar to retail stores as the chain tried to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and products other than food.
Since acquiring the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has opened Argos divisions in hundreds of stores, as well as some Habitat divisions – a move that has had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket chain to cure wrinkles in the beauty and pharmaceutical classes failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the dispute over the distribution of the revenues of the pharmaceutical divisions in its stores put an end to this.
The new strategy came about three years ago after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in its 281 stores to Celesio, which operates the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to the chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “By transforming the look of our rangers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We have also hired qualified staff to provide advice to those interested.
Our range of brands caters to every need, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide the temptation to take the shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones 'stormed' after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones has left “storming” after TV host Holly Willoughby cancelled an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for her lifestyle store to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly brand of home wear and accessories.
The two celebrities’ businesses were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that he is quitting.
Holly Willoughby pulled the matches out of Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones when she stepped out of her promising lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her own highly lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was “stormed” when a television lover announced at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones’s business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he had no time left to dedicate to their common brand of homewear and accessories, Truly, due to new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in total.
The two celebrities’ businesses had previously been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow-listed Goop brand and were expected to double Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of assets.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled to one of his vacation homes from the island country.
According to one source, “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long run, and it will provide his livelihood for the next few decades.
His departure was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, as the departure was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of merchandise for sale."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning’s host, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, thanks to the huge sums invested in the range from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, and the potential for slippages.
And it could mean the end of an old friendship.
Three-child hostess and her husband Dan Baldwin had been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp back in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will be M&S’ product face and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones’] business affairs.”
He said, “We fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider “unchairable” and for his positive comments on the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump asked in a funny “newsreader” voice.
“I didn’t allow anything.”
Kim would like to meet for a second time after Trump welcomed the first meeting in Singapore in June as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But talks about nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s representative Ri Jongho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees it, there is no “adequate response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to maintain sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was more optimistic in his campaign speech.
“Things are going well with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had provided positive prospects – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of U.S. troops.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Being president is not difficult, but now there aren’t a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in crowded, there are only about 200 people standing in front of me,” Trump said, pointing to the group in front of him.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia’s tsunami and earthquake
Indonesia has refused assistance from international aid agencies after the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had to be displaced, no national disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid to arrive.
“In the past, many cases have been very clear that they do not need international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on setting up a relief team that can be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in the rescues on the spot.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency, said Indonesian authorities are currently evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid agencies should be involved.
Despite ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating force of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in the province of Aceh, this is not common in other coastal areas.
Although there was a tsunami signal, the apparent lack of a tsunami signaling siren system in Palu also contributed to a disaster that claimed human lives.
Transportation between Indonesian islands can be difficult even in the best weather.
Logistics is even more problematic in times of natural disasters.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia’s shabby infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and has not saved costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president is faced with the ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were deported as a result of riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs attacked each other on the streets with brush cutters, bows and arrows, as well as other scattered weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a huge equator against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored a goal in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in London in the 89th minute, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea.
His team lost 0-1 when Sturridge scored a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's gate.
He first threw the ball to the left and then launched a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The gunshot crossed high above the sixteenth and flew toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net over the drifting Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"I just wanted to get in position because there's always someone like Shaq who plays the ball forward, so I tried to get myself in position as best I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took him off, then I didn’t think much and I shot him.”
Chelsea led 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>0 in the quarter-finals after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> passed the ball to the Blues to the corner, then managed to break away from the midfield and rush into the Liverpool half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> started after a quick pass and got the ball back in the midfield.
Then he launched Hazard with a beautiful handover to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense and eventually sent the ball to the far corner at the Liverpool gate next to Alisson Becker with a left shot.
As the next stop in the Champions League group matches, Liverpool will meet Naples on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo Arena in Naples.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Indonesian tsunami kills 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency said on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami that followed it on Friday, several people were buried under the ruins, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, are covered with the ruins of fallen buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder
The police opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman’s body was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are requesting residents in the area who have seen anything or are dead to report.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, however, I hereby request everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and who may have seen or heard something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken anything on board cameras, to contact us as they may have information relevant to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends came to the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police are currently notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but police told him that no one could enter the building and leave it.
When he found out what had happened, the man could not speak.
The residents of the building have been informed that it may take several hours before they can enter the building again.
One of the police officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
“It’s terrible,” he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., two police minibuses were inside the cordon and another outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone with any information should write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Crimestoppers organization on the anonymous phone number 0800 555 111 and refer to file 247 on September 30.
The parliamentary statue of Cromwell is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue might be a poetic justice for the fact that Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers in the past had ravaged England’s cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with the enthusiasm of the Taliban.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick’s suggestion is “foolishness,” an “experiment to rewrite history.”
According to John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, “It was inevitable that at some point in the current debates on the removal of statues, the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Palace of Westminster would eventually become a target.
During the English Civil War, image destruction was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell could be the victim of the actions of his ancestor in the preceding century, Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning Cromwell depiction reflects the 19th-century view and commemorates a historical figure that many still consider to be celebrated today.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may be seen by fewer people today than at the end of the 19th century, but many still regard him as a protector of parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, monarchy.
Whether this picture is accurate is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this strife, which broke out in the middle of the seventeenth century, had an impact on the future fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as a Lord Protector are worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer pig kills Chinese farmer
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man identified only as Yuan, covered in blood, was found with a torn artery near a pig pit in the city of Liupanshui in Kuizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is planning to vaccinate pigs in a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man’s body and discovered that the door of the neighboring pighouse was open.
According to him, the mouth of the giant pig in the pighouse was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the 250-pound pig actually bit the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody, and they were torn apart," said a relative named Wu by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan walked into the pighouse at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's property.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been sealed so that it could no longer harm others while police were investigating the leads on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although this is not common, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their farm in Massachusetts and caused him life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales squeezed a farmer’s tractor until his wife managed to alarm him.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually prone to attack, but can become aggressive by the taste of blood.
“They’re very players.
Like little children, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Severe rainfall following Hurricane Rosa in the Southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it rises above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa hit at 140 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. East Coast Time on Sunday, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and heads westward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it inundates the southwestern areas of the United States with heavy tropical vapours as a tropical storm.
The storm could cause rainfall of up to 25 cm in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, meeting the approaching low-pressure masses of tropical mist will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Here, precipitation of 3 to 10 cm can cause sudden floods, floods filled with debris, and landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can cause rainfall of 5 to 8 cm per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, precipitation is expected to range from 5 to 10 cm, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rains, it is not recommended to walk in the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into roaring rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden windstorms and dust clouds.
The impending low-pressure masses can cause heavy rains in some places off the coast of southern California.
Rainfall of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause small floods filled with debris and slippery road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Sporadic tropical rains can occur as early as Sunday evening and Monday morning in Arizona, and on Monday during the day and on Tuesday the rains extend to wider areas.
Severe rainfall will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic air masses cool down, but the tropical ones will remain fairly warm.
This can sometimes cause drastic temperature differences even over short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central US region on Sunday.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), have a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees.
In the coming days, we expect to feel the summer heat again in larger areas.
The central and eastern United States is expected to be warm in the first half of October, with temperatures ranging from the southern Great Plain to some parts of the Northwest around 25-30 degrees.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
The long-term weather forecast predicts that temperatures in the eastern United States will likely exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition.
More than 20 million viewers on six television channels followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate remained unresolved and broadcasters were forced to interrupt regular broadcasting due to a last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Affairs Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been grabbing him and trying to undress him at a high school party.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
The testimonies, reported by Nielsen, were likely seen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen finds it hard to measure the number of people who watch shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, this is the number of spectators for football finalists or for the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which featured experts supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest number of viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94, MSNBC had 2.89, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement that the senator would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS showed a loud crowd of protesters taking the elevator to a meeting of the Court Affairs Committee.
He was staring at the scene for minutes while the crowd slandered him, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others yelled at him, “You have the power to do what so many women can’t do.”
Flake only said that his office issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share what he had to say at the committee hearing.
He was then seen on cable and broadcasting channels hours later as the committee voted on whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination would be submitted to the entire Senate for a vote.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced of this need in his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision following conversations with Coons and later with other senators.
Flake made the right use of his power, as it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political gambling
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardizing the UK’s future and undermining the nation’s interests by playing political games.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper, right next to May’s interview, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit, saying the suggestion that Britain and the EU handle each other’s customs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting that killed 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Police released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and reported that Sims’ glasses had fallen during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was on it, according to a WAFB channel on CBS's network.
After questioning Simpson, the police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to Advocate's report, the court set bail at <0x24>350,000.
A preliminary report released by the East Baton Rouge County coroner on Friday said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The agency thanked Louisiana State Police’s Criminal Escape Task Force, State Police’s Forensic Laboratory, University Police and residents for their help in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the relevant law enforcement forces for their “committed and persevering efforts to find out the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
In the last season, Sims scored a rebound average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the news of Sims’ death had “shocked” and “shocked” the team.
“You’re always scared of this happening,” Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After volcanic activity in the crater intensified and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges occurred in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several roars and quakes.
In pictures on social media sites in certain areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the windshields of cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southeast of Mexico’s capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with the police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s splitting referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the stormtroopers that held them back, so the streets that were once crowded with tourists were now covered with dense powder paint.
Later in the day, more fighting broke out, during which police officers tried to maintain order with a stick.
The pro-independence groups, who were singing the slogan “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive” and the pro-unity demonstrators, who were lined up behind the slogan “Live Spain”, were facing each other for hours.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated with minor injuries during the protests.
The tensions in the region, which is soaring with independence aspirations, continue to decline following the referendum of October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
Voters voted by a huge majority to secede, although the turnout was rather low, as the majority of unionists boycotted the vote.
Catalan officials said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting in polling stations.
Pro-independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration ended up not on the regular route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said there was no chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I’ve seen my parents cry tears of joy for what we can vote for, but now we’re at a standstill,” he said.
Although the regional elections in December last year achieved an important, if limited, victory, Catalan independence parties have had difficulty maintaining their momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are awaiting arrest for their role in organising the referendum and subsequently proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic who recorded the police-supporting demonstration on his phone, said politicians on both sides were shooting at the conflict.
“The situation is getting tense,” he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
“The best way I can reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents is by participating as a candidate in the European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrest three men who drove their car into a house
Police arrested a 33-year-old man, a 34-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who drove their car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car may have even been shot with a crossbow.
Menga scores 1–0 against the Rangers by Livingston
Dolly Menga secured Livingston's victory with her first goal
Livingston, who just made it to the first division, surprised the Rangers with a second defeat for Steven Gerrard, who has been coaching the Ibrox club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal made the real difference, as Gary Holt's team was in second place with Hibernian.
The Gerrards continue to remain unchallenged in the current Scottish league season and will face the first-place Hearts team next Sunday, with eight points behind.
However, the Rangers will face a match against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased its divisional defeat series to six victories, which means that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't lost with the team yet.
Livingston missed a number of situations against the inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before a single goal in the game, as they caused the Rangers a lot of problems with their offensive game.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but dragged the attack too long, and Alan Lithgow's attempt proved broad after sliding in to hit Craig Halkett's crossed-over ball in front of the goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were confident that they could distract the guests in fixed play situations.
The decisive goal was born out of exactly this situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of this to score from the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in ball possession, but domestic defense remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely compromised.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, with the exception of one situation where Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was shunned by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed another free kick from Livingston.
Two penalties were not given to the attacking team, one for Halkett's relay against Glenn Middleton, and the other for his hand.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – match analysis
Tony Macaroni from Arena reports Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland Correspondent
Livingston had a phenomenal performance and was rewarded.
The players performed well and exceeded expectations.
The team members and their playing style have hardly changed since they returned to the forefront, but Holt’s efforts are also highly commendable, as the coach has stimulated the team since his arrival.
Several players have taken their best form.
Team captain Halkett played a huge role with his well-organized defense, and Menga properly swept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrrall.
The Rangers had no idea.
No matter how well they performed at times under Gerrard’s leadership, they were unable to reach that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break the domestic defense once anyway – so the Rangers had to get together quickly, as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an finds mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin was characterized by a pleasant atmosphere and good cheer.
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s divided visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s membership of the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne to celebrate the opening of a newly built huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
Police have banned a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but several supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including many Kurds, disapproved of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations illustrate the divisive nature of the president’s policy, which some German citizens of Turkish origin celebrate as a hero while others see as an autocrat.
Road Accident in Deptford: A cyclist crashed into a car and lost his life
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high-traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, who died at the scene.
The collision occurred just months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
According to a London police statement, police are still working on the man’s identity to inform his relatives.
As a result of the investigation, road closures and bus diversions have made traffic difficult, and authorities have advised drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in riots in a highly guarded man's prison, the prison's administration said.
The riots began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and have not yet been stopped.
In order to deal with the situation, the authorities deployed a special force called "Tornado", which involved eight prisoners who were pushed back into a building wing.
The members of the Special Forces only suffered minor head injuries, which they managed to perform on the spot.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary said: “Specially trained prison guards are handling the situation in the Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and face further prison sentences."
The Long Lartin men's penitentiary holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison director was reportedly hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the Special Forces also needed help to suppress a serious riot in which prisoners attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but droughts may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but this is what the state is expected to expect at the beginning of next week, when a remnant of hurricane Rosa sweeps the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood alerts Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rains.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service tweeted: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached a 200-mile radius of Phonenix in the form of tropical storms or depression!
For example, Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached its border 40 miles away.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, which in extreme cases, such as in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, can reach 150 mm.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (middle areas of the Siklás Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) precipitation of 25-50 mm can be expected, but in some places it can fall as much as 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa could bring relief to areas not threatened by thunderstorm waters, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on the drought-stricken southwestern regions.
“According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
It will continue to be hurricane-powered, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, it will pass about 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia land bridge in Mexico, heading north at a speed of about 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and lose strength.
As a result, Mexico is expected to be re-entered as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“The rainfall can result in an average of 70–150 mm of precipitation from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm of precipitation,” the report said.
Rosa then travels north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday, in the form of tropical depression, to sweep across Arizona, reaching the southern areas of Utah by Tuesday night.
“The biggest threat posed by Rosa and its remains will be extreme rainfall in Lower California, Northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening thunderstorm waters and sediment flows in desert areas, and in mountainous areas, landslides are to be avoided.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
At 4 a.m. local time on Saturday, an injured teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was “stable”.
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset during the night.
The authorities are asking the public if anyone has a mobile phone record of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh must have endured the Democratic Party’s “malice and anger”
“Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure the Democratic Party’s “malice and anger” during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he firmly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had been sexually assaulted decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and supported his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans could see with their own eyes” Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and fearless character.”
"The votes cast for Judge Kavanaugh are votes cast for one of the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, who has an immaculate public service record," Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the interim elections.
“We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not going to go in person, but I’m going to go in person,” he said.
“I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats are following a tactic of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican advisor told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake tsunami, number of dead rises
Many people were swept away by the flood, and at least 384 people died when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves nearly six meters (18 feet) high reached the shore at dusk, dragging many away and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people simply stayed longer on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became the victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Emergency Response Agency (BNPB) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses and everything else off the shore," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the shore.
Some climbed to the top of the trees from the flood and escaped, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters Please.
The agency’s aerial photos of the disaster show many destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks rocked the coastal city.
Earthquakes were detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT), the Friday earthquake released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographic conditions may have intensified the impact of the tsunami.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant", thousands of houses were destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several bodies of victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far has been 540, and another 29 are being sought.
According to Nugroho, on the coastline 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, in the area known as Donggala, the number of injured and the damage caused could be even greater as it was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communication is “completely paralyzed, no information can be obtained,” Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, announcing that the organization's experts and volunteers were already on their way to the affected area.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse,” he added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday for not informing the public about the Palut tsunami, but the management said the waves had reached the coast already when the alarm was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man from the upper floor of a building trying to warn people in the streets of the impending tsunami with desperate cries.
Within a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore, dragging cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, making communication around Palu impossible, making it more difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The military has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities by freight aircraft, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only to facilitate relief work, and it will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami has killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team safely arrived from Donggala to the city of Palu, where the employees found shelter under tent curtains erected in the office yard, but on their way they encountered traces of terrible destruction, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“The situation is very bad.”
While the relief teams were preparing for disaster relief work, some complained that foreign specialists with extensive experience in this field could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, aid and personnel coming from overseas can only be allowed into the country if the disaster is declared a disaster-affected area at national level.
That hasn't happened yet.
“The incident is still being treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can let international emergency services in, but there have been no reports so far.”
On the second night after the Friday quake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing people continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape would smuggle some light into the dark atmosphere of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, workers were able to rescue a woman who was buried next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month and this time took place in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing, other students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran paraglider, what has happened is a huge mental burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among paragliders, he spent hours desperately trying to reach the competitors who were attending the beach festival on WhatsApp Please.
In addition to the messages, however, there was only one gray tick instead of two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
<0x24>26,750 stolen while charging ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink’s employee who was loading an ATM with cash at Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the cash truck had just emptied an ATM at the entertainment center and was about to fill it with additional banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man “approached his Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses also saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not specify the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who would like to provide information about the identity of the perpetrators can contact the police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper's name has changed to Y
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with a message: “The creature formerly called Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West had been nicknamed Ye for some time, and it was the title of his eighth album released in June.
He announced the name change before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The show takes the place of Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for “emotional reasons”, the producer of the show said.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper’s current artistic name – according to earlier revelations, it also has religious significance for West.
“I know that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier when talking to radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I’m you and I’m us and we’re all one.
Kanye means the only thing, and it became Ye, which represents the good, the evil, the confusion, everything within us.
The album reflects who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he now prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, has also varied several times on whether his name should be inscribed in hyphens or capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has pledged to never use the military against civilians to mark the 50th anniversary of the student demonstrations.
López Obrador said on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on the participants of a peaceful demonstration in the square, causing the deaths of about 300 people, when leftist student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to help young people in Mexico by providing students with monthly financial benefits and plans to set up more free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double the funding for AI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and developer of artificial intelligence solutions who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced plans to become the world’s number one AI developer by 2030.
“Double the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US, and the next breakthrough in the field of AI is imminent,” Lee said.
By doubling research grants, the chances of the U.S. taking the next big step in artificial intelligence would be doubled, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order (AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would be held, as it would be an opportunity to find new future shapers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the government support they need for their research, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking the leads in science, it’s the big companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted several large university skulls to work in the field of AI.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could help the U.S.’s efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think it should automatically be a green card for those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced a plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation provides support to academic staff in a similar way as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently spending <0x24>100 million a year to support AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which was planning to set up a national security AI committee, has not taken any further action on the matter for months.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “North Macedonian Republic”, a move that would resolve a decades-old disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country’s application for EU and NATO membership from being accepted.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, has argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it claims a Greek territory of the same name, so it has vetoed the country’s membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached a deal in June on the new name of the state, but nationalist opponents say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not take part in the referendum and, as a result of the boycott campaign launched, doubts have arisen as to whether the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum will be achieved.
The question on the ballot papers is: “Will the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order to give Macedonia, as one of the countries that have risen from the ruins of Yugoslavia, a chance to become a member of the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country so that Macedonia’s young people can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding in itself, sufficient Members of Parliament have declared that they feel bound by the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no reports of irregularities were received until 13:00 on the day of the election.
However, up to this point, the turnout rate was only 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted for the name change in a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, chairs and tents for boycotters of the referendum.
“We support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we would like to join with pride, with our heads raised, and not through the maid’s door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership could be expected to result in investments in Macedonia that the country with an unemployment rate of more than 20% is in great need of.
“I think the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the country’s population is fundamentally supportive of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after voting.
He also added that the “yes” vote is “the assurance of the future of the country.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Science, between 30 and 43 percent of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, the attendance rate is expected to be 57% on Sunday.
70% of those who want to vote said they will vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least one vote above 50%.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero scores full Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took Brighton seriously and Manchester City won 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield as the first step of the attack, and
He slipped between the three Brighton defenders and got out into the open field.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He tricked a defender and ran several times as he approached the Brighton Sixteen.
Then it went to the left for Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero, who finished the action with his right leg, hitting the right side of the gate of the Brighton netman Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he could play for 55, at most 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal.”
Sterling took the initial advantage of the blues in the English championship.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero, who is on the Brighton side, got a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane played with the ball for a while before making the long shot at Sterling.
For the Blues, he could only swipe the ball into the goal before it slipped out of the baseline.
The City will play next Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, with Hoffenheim in the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies
As the Nationals missed their chance to enter the post-season season, they had no reason to make a real effort.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, can’t wait to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance in the playoffs. The Rockies have a one-match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies secured at least one comforting spot with a 5–2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title remains to be won.
“While we no longer have a chance, we can stand up to them in Denver with the audience and the other team’s atmosphere expected to be at its peak compared to the whole year.
Of course I want to be on track like that!”
The Nationals have yet to select the starting player for Sunday, but it is reported that Scherzer will be the pitcher.
For Scherzer, who took part in a pitcher training on Thursday, this will be his 34th starting pitcher on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed Washington player will have 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president also implicitly referred to the situation around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones, the big ones – I’m not running personally, but I’m actually running, and that’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump said: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical Democratic groups are doing, they can see with their own eyes.
They are truly determined and able to use any means to regain power, malice and vileness can be seen.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample to have control, to have power. That's what they want, control and power, but we don't give up."
According to the president, the Democrats are using “resistance and obstruction.”
“You’ve seen all of this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and malicious and vile and liar.”
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee, before which he expressed a loud disapproval of the crowd gathered.
“Do you remember what he answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all this with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who freely say what they think
I was not at all surprised when Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan was treated similarly for her unwavering opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship did not like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security and Europe, which ironically are precisely the issues on which Jeremy also disagreed with former leaders.
The Labour Party’s invitation to a meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said they wanted a “receptive and productive meeting”.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party representative, these Friday evening meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, however, today the tone has changed, and the promise of a “more restrained, more polite” policy has been forgotten, if at all, if ever realised.
It is increasingly striking that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This trend started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have been asking me more and more recently to turn my back on my personal opinion and take a stand for things that I would never agree with, be it national security or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, no matter what I actually said, they start blaspheming me on social media, demanding my replacement, criticizing the politics of centralization, and telling me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are usually confined to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues in politics who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with every “distrust” motion and every change to the electoral rules, the circle of those who are tolerated in the party is getting narrower.
Over the years, many people have advised me to hold back, not to be so outspoken, and then “everything will be fine.”
But that’s not why I started a political career.
Thirty-two years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classroom almost collapsed, and then I fought for better public support for the most deprived as a local councillor and a government minister.
I never hid my political views, nor did I do otherwise in the last election.
It was clear to everyone in Nottingham East what political positions I took and on which issues I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families but also companies and public services, I do not understand why I have to devote so much time and energy to questioning my loyalty to the Labour leader.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of replacement or political purpose will discourage me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.

Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr reaches the summit
Two late attempts have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s deserved victory in the most entertaining match of the day, the Tennant’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the chart, the only undefeated out of ten teams.
Thanks to their unrivalled protection and superior use of the situation, they have won, so the Hungarians and Coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had a lot of challenges to face in our games so far, but we’re still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr took advantage of his situation much better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which made Frazier Climo a point, gave Ayr an advantage. The game's yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which was loaned to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt failed to score.
Climo put a penalty on Ayr's defense, scored a point in the mid-term and a one-man test, so the first half ended with a 17-5 result in favor of Ayr.
Melrose started strong in the second half, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg, reducing the team's drawback to five points.
The game lasted for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and had to be taken off the pitch, and in the sequel Ayr further increased his advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt, which was rewarded with the help of Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson also received a yellow card, and Melrose succeeded in stopping Bruce Colvine's attempt in human form, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started catching up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for disconnecting Climo without a ball, MacPherson scored a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's storming team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry to the front for his fifth attempt at home.
The protagonist of Still Game started a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be moving towards the catering industry: it turns out he’s headed a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC’s popular series, which he co-writes and co-stars with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the next season will be the ninth, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his post-Craiglang life.
According to official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to profit from Glasgow’s “blooming hospitality industry.”
'The sea is ours': Bolivia without coastlines hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the sailboated naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases proclaim the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover."
In a coastal Bolivia, the memories of the lost coast, taken away by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, are still vivid, and there is a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps now been most embraced in many decades, since Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1st, which concludes five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the ball that infuses a spirit of belonging and peace with people who are in a positive mood for the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the International Court of Justice’s ruling on screens, hoping that the Hague Court will stand with Bolivia and Chile will be obliged to sit at the negotiating table after decades of rapsodic attitudes, so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president Evo Morales, facing a controversial fight for re-election next year, could lose a lot with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said in a statement at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor, and it would not change the situation much if its decision were positive for Bolivia.
The U.N. body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to judge Chile, and it has also stipulated in advance that it will not affect the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was delivered less than six months after the closing statements indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the past four years have not only not helped Bolivia's cause, but they have even put it backwards.
“The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” Zárate said.
Because of Morales’ hostile rhetoric, the rest of the Chilean benevolence has gone away.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly resume negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to enter into a dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees with the statement that the court decision would have been unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to “both come out of a 139-year-long ending of conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, had used the maritime debate to take political advantage of it.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The verdict gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
The remark was made when it appeared that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had managed to resume the stalled nuclear talks, more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
“I crave to believe that the continued sanctions and US obstruction of the Korean War end statement will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees,” Ri said.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s commitment to dismantling the arsenal, which is likely to be seen as the only key to the country’s security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, the huge headgear that will soon appear in high-end stores has appeared
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the day completely, you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a range of unusually oversized headgear as part of their 2019 spring/summer collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats made Instagram sensational this summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-grabbing works on the podium.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with feather-like, wide flanges, and almost completely absorbed the models’ heads.
Among the other oversized accessories were watermelons adorned with gemstones, a wizarding hat, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a person’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a range of bizarre masks just before Halloween.
Several of the colorful masks had sewn their mouths and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture.
One of them looked like a diving mask with a pipe and glasses, and the other looked like a melting cone of ice cream.
If you like these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
Style analysts predict that the huge hats may already be on their way to high-end clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of “La Bomba”, a 60 cm wide straw hat that we’ve seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Conquering social media, the cult brand behind the less practical hat presented another piece on the runway: a straw beach bag, almost the size of the swimsuit model that holds it.
The dark orange rafia bag – decorated with rafia pads and a white leather clamp on top – was one of the highlights of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring/summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the huge hats and beach bags to appear next summer in high-end clothing stores. The designer has created such an elementary effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have traditionally provided excellent education. Looking at the latest outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed by 2018, which is further reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying at institutions of this kind, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide the best possible service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers, and the positions they occupy as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language that they understand, they get to their head.
But if you speak in his language, it will reach his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that students from independent schools across the country have the best results from foreign languages.
Sixty-eight percent of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher A grade (over eighty-five percent).
Data from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 percent of students received higher A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved A grades.
These findings also show that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and non-independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Vocational Training Commission showed that 17% of employers found it difficult to fill vacancies because of a lack of language skills.
This shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As knowledge of foreign languages is expected in more and more workplaces, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if you have learned a foreign language, you will gain lifelong knowledge that will bring you a clear benefit.
The ability to communicate directly with people of other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to a candidate who speaks several languages.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not speak a single foreign language well enough to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent) of respondents.
This is why it is important to focus on language education for children.
Speaking more languages, especially those of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, equipping them to apply for more important jobs as adults.
Every school in Scotland will have different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of paramount importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you will be able to learn a number of optional languages at independent schools and will be trained by educators who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that equips and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to notice that in the current global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and this should be reflected in education.
As a matter of fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer choice, diverse and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – that’s how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron Debuts with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It won’t take long for fans to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will spend on the track is still questionable.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play for a limited time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans for the Lakers were in the six-game pre-season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the pre-season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will begin a long series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five announced events next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm the candidate for the seat of the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the forthcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump’s event in West Virginia start tonight, and where can you follow it online?
Trump’s speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can also follow Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online via YouTube live stream.
Trump is likely to be involved in this week’s hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which was particularly tense in light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate’s confirmation vote was suspended for a maximum of a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary goal of the sudden increase in events is to help the Republicans in the run-up to the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said the five events next week will be aimed at “activating voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently own in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters wrote.
“The ability to control Congress is so critical to his political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We are facing a dense campaign period,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned for tonight’s event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia Metro News said: “It can bring backers from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania and even be featured in media coverage in Pittsburgh.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favourable position according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intercede personally to get a better score in the surveys," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said in a statement.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Fights Full Shoulder Width Before Sunday Individuals to Keep Hope Alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Saturday afternoon fours were very much needed by the Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of luck and momentum is a fairly airy sporting concept, yet every player believes in it, especially in tournaments like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead and only four advantages, so we can say we have the ball right now," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and there are still twelve to be won.
The Americans, as Spieth tells them, feel that they have finally gotten a little bit of wind and can draw encouragement from many things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His cry for victory became louder and louder as he progressed in the lap, hitting a critical roll and equalizing in the fourth game, so that he and Thomas were in double loss after two.
The game's decisive roll at hole 15 resulted in a similar shout of joy, a kind that can make the viewer believe that everything is not lost for the American team.
“All you have to do is dig deep inside of yourself and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s exactly what players are waiting for.
Eighteen holes for a chance to leave a mark on you.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s most popular pair, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange, but adorable pair brought four out of four, and they don't seem to be able to make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not above par to perform on Saturday afternoon, and they performed similarly on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine stages on Friday morning.
Thanks to this series and the dynamic that has developed between them and the crowd that supports them, they have become the benchmark by Sunday, and no one is expected to secure Europe’s victory on the Le Golf National circuit with the Sun’s receipt more than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning four, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once, with one and twice two shots above par, the Spaniards and the Swedes scored the first nine holes, pushing them into a low-pitch from which they had no chance of getting out.
But on Sunday, you won't have anyone to help you out of your pit.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are extremely entertaining, thanks to the interactions of the pairs. You can watch who gives what advice, who doesn’t, and how strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and it starts the last day with a significant advantage, but this section four has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them have been missing, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a positive advantage after finishing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with 10-6 against the United States.
The pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race, winning two victories against the infirmary Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, which is trying to regain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the constantly failing American team in the morning's four-ball games, winning the series 3-1.
America showed greater resistance during the fours, bringing in two matches, but they still couldn't close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team would have to score eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari – who are referred to as “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After defeating Woods-Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a definite 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed his talent, but lost 19 of his 29 matches, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning four-ball games, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and was beaten 2&1 in the fours by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third place in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not succeed on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed Americans how to do it with two points on Saturday.
They scored a painful 2&1 victory against Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours in 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team only managed to come back from a four-point lag in individual races twice, although one draw for Furyk's title-defending team is enough to hold the trophy.
However, after only being second best for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems rather unrealistic.
“There is no way” that North Korea will unilaterally disband if it does not trust its negotiating partner
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions had only increased its distrust of the United States, and that it was impossible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho said that North Korea had taken “significant and generous steps” in the past year, such as shutting down nuclear and missile tests, shutting down nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to expand its nuclear arsenal and scope of nuclear technology.
"Unfortunately, we do not see similar responses from the Americans," he said.
“In the absence of trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not assured and that, under these circumstances, there is no way of unilaterally dismantling it first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s disappointment at Washington’s resistance to the idea of a “stage” nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would receive rewards for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed meaningful because he did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri cited a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an in power US president and a North Korean leader that took place in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s integrity.
North Korea aims to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has not given in to tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and increases the pressure with sanctions to force its will on us, and it also protests against the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-relief sanctions only increase our suspicion.”
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the U.S. president made a special mention at the UN earlier this week.
He said three meetings had taken place between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jei in the past five months, adding: “If the country affected by nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
Despite this, Ri’s tone of speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the “evil president,” called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps toward disarmament, but also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions will remain until North Korea completes nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken so far.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must be steadfastly adhered to until we have achieved actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly break and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go very well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands” hours later.
During a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the U.S. took “appropriate steps.”
Mun said Kim’s “appropriate steps” would be the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as steps that could lead to a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to have enough rest
A new subject at Harvard University this year prompted students to sleep more, fighting against the increasingly macho culture of caffeine-heated night-long learning.
One academic concluded that students at the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should take care of themselves.
The course, the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard College of Medicine and practises as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was encouraged to develop the course by giving a lecture earlier on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and asked me, ‘Why do I face this now as a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, launched for the first time this year, teaches students how proper sleep patterns have a fundamental impact on their academic and sporting performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard College of Medicine and director of the university’s health service, said the university decided to start the course because during the week, students were found to be extremely sleepy.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive exercises.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and why bedtime routines are important.
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the university area with interactive icons to encourage participants to rethink their daily routine.
“We know that we are not going to change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have a right to this knowledge – just as they have a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” Czeisler said.
A culture that continues to flourish in which it is an achievement to study through a night or two, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students result in increasing problems of insomnia.
Sufficient and quality sleep is a student’s “secret weapon” in the fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even protects against obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starving mode and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler set up the course, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year at Harvard, he took one of the professor’s courses as a freshman.
He said that what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to start a university-level training.
It hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar degree programme before entering the competitive sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning to go to bed, a wake-up call, and get acquainted with the damaging effects of “blue light” emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which could easily distract them from their daily rhythms and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's slipped team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibroxians tried to win their first foreign victory after the 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard lost his second to date from Gary Holt's 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half, and the Rangers' unmotivated team was not even close to equalizing.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, lagging behind the Hibernian only because of the difference in goals.
In addition, the Rangers may face further difficulties after the coastal beacon Calum Spence’s head injury caused it to need medical attention due to an object likely to be dropped from the guest stands.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, however, joined Livingston with the same 11 men who took a point from the Hearts last week and would have been happy to watch his perfected team stifle his opponent’s game wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led in ball possession, Livingston made more progress with what he gained.
They could have scored in the first two minutes of Menga's first pass, launching Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed to sell the ziccer.
A low free kick by Keaghan Jacobs landed on team captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the final third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the fifteenth minute of his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers had only two shots to the first half goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi’s attempt in the 34th minute went against the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a ziccer forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react in time when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was able to find Menga for an easy ending.
Gerrard decided to take a break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately had an effect on the game when the extreme Morelos was teased, but Kelly, who gave the stunning shape, blocked in time.
Livingston continued to get to play exactly the game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net and knocked down Jacobs' position before Lithgow made a mistake.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, attempted to win another eleven when he met Jacobs, but Thomson was still unconvinced.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A fragment of our "Sunday morning" Almanach: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been a basic tool of science ever since, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it has also become a part of pop culture:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. It can be used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms being emitted due to the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Listen, he’s bouncing right now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to 'See' Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to 'See' and Destroy Abnormal Cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
In this way, they are able to “see” the protein that accompanies all kinds of cancers.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2, which is a common accompanying of several types of cancer; and then re-implanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of multiple cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, based on highlighting immune cells and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been successfully used in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
The SNL role of Kanye West, wearing the Maga cap, culminated in a slanderous tirade of Trump supporters.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was whistled out in Saturday Night Live’s studio after an incoherent statement to praise US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in Make America’s Great Again cap, he began to speak out against the Democrats and once again underlined his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, they ask, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee about the sexual assault charges of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's speech was posted on social media by humorist Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by filling it up.
West even complained to the audience that he was bullied behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out in that hat.’
I'm intimidated!
And they said I was in the sunken place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a sinking place? I’ll put on my Superman coat because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His expressions were accompanied by whistles from the audience at least twice, and the SNL actors were apparently embarrassed, according to one eyewitness to Variety: “The whole studio is enveloped in silence.”
West was replaced by singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West raised questions when he performed I Love It dressed as Perrier's glass.
Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, tweeted: “Thank you to one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO THE WHOLESALE.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “she was herself, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided to NOT reward someone (by buying their music or fashion items or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe to embrace and disseminate an ideology that is harmful to the community I belong to.
He's free.
“We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name to "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He’s not the first artist to change his name, following in Diddy’s footsteps, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knife killer accused of attempted manslaughter
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an eastern Belfast restaurant on Friday.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, finds exaggerated masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and she often takes a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, pointing out that seeing such heroes, boys often feel that it takes tough action to earn respect.
Kit, in a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, said he felt “something went wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the damaging effects of exaggerated masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old, series colleague Rose Leslie, said she felt it was very important to fix the problem.
“I am deeply affected by this matter – how did the representation of masculinity become so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men in childhood about the problem we are facing today?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the dissemination of the distorted image of masculinity, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
Continuing the thought, he added: “What is it that we are born with, and what are we learning?
What do the streets and the television send to the young boys that makes them feel that this is the only way they can be men?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
“There’s something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, Kit stated that after the summer season's closing, he would not be featured in Game of Thrones history series or sequels because "he is fed up with battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will play the role of Sam Shepard in the remake of True West, a film about a producer and his robbery brother.
The actor said the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife Rose, whom he met while making the series.
"I met my wife on the set, so I owe it to my future family and my future life," Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new patients in China increased by 14%
China reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, this represents more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of cases reported increased by around 40,000.
A significant change compared to the past is that the vast majority of newly infected people contract the disease sexually.
The disease spread rapidly by transfusions of previously infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of such cases has since dropped to nearly zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has remained very strong.
According to estimates in various studies, due to the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
In many cases, the disease is transmitted in these relationships due to inadequate sexual protection.
The Chinese government has been providing universal access to anti-HIV drugs since 2003 as part of a program to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her crew members leaked data from Republican senators and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted personal details of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Congresswoman said the allegations were spread by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters tweeted.
The information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday, and the publisher's identity is unknown, but it is certain that it was posted from Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh on sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
According to conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the source IP address is linked to Waters’ office, and data has been provided on a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill writes.
"These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously a lie," Waters said.
– My crew member is not responsible for the leakage of information. However, the right to anonymity, the protection of personal data and security has been violated as a result of fraudulent and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously a lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It appears that Waters does not have the temper necessary to hold the office of deputy.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't react angry.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Waters’ reaction was apparently likened to that of Judge Fleischer Kavanaugh’s reaction to criticism from the Democratic Party, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running as a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm election, also shared his views on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious," he wrote in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies” about the false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified," Waters continued, "and that they are legally held accountable for any acts that endanger or harm any member of my team."
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralyzing spy comedy
It has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception to the Johnny English action comedy/parody franchise, of which the first part, Johnny English in 2003, and the second part, Johnny English reloaded, were released in theaters in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation be the sarcastic, self-paroding satires in which we boast of our own obvious paralysis?
What is certain is that the eye-catching, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition to make another comeback – it is clear from his name that this comic character was created so that audiences in cinemas in non-English-speaking countries of the world could laugh at it.
Johnny English, of course, is a crazy secret agent who thinks he is charming with his bizarre manners, so he reminds me a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, occasionally Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who pressed a single key to contribute to the opening ceremony of The Cars of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial that left chaos everywhere.
There are some good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter in medieval armor, and when he arrived, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comic veins are good in the film, but the humor of the film doesn’t really work, and even seems superfluous, because nowadays franchises with “serious” tone, like James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series, are brave enough to reach out for humor.
Feeling that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy, unsuccessful adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings to the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is perpetual: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal hacked into the British spy network’s top-secret online network and revealed the identities of all British agents to the horror of the on-call agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got one such small role in the film.
This may be the last nail in the coffin of the presumptuous and divisive prime minister whose political popularity is already in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically playing Theresa May, bringing everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since every active agent has been identified, he must put a retired agent on the job.
This retired agent is, of course, the dumb-handed Johnny English, who has been teaching at a prestigious school since his retirement, but apart from the curriculum, he teaches children to spy – there are funny scenes, of course, while English explains the basics of spying in a "Rockschool" way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he meets Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller, during an emergency briefing.
Bough has since been married to the captain of a submarine, who is always up to his ears – the captain played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles.
In this way, his Majesty's dumb-ass National Security Service duo "Batman and Robin" returns to action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly entangled by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and he is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: set fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as a waiter, smuggle themselves onto Volta’s luxury yacht in an astonishing turmoil, and English unleashes hell when she tries to get to know Volta’s apartment using a VR headset.
These are the stations we need to get to the end, but no matter how cheerful and twisting it is, it may be a little too much of a children’s film.
The end result is quite mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, the question is: can the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
Labour denies introducing four-day working week while paying five-day wages to British workers
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: introducing a four-day working week, with workers working for five days' wages.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the AI (Artificial Intelligence) revolution, with executives giving workers extra days off due to increased revenue.
According to the plan, workers would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea would “suit” to the party’s economic program, which aims to tilt the balance on the side of the workers in the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, which they believe would allow workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it won’t happen overnight, the four-day working week is a concept that fits well into the party’s programme to tilt the balance of the economy towards the workers and, moreover, fits into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned already in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day working week.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at a Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was struggling to regain power from the "faceless directors" and the "beneficials" of the regimes.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were implemented, the shareholders of the water supply companies would not receive back the full profits due to them, as a Labour government would make “deductions” to punish alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to include employees on the board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private-sector companies to employees, who would receive 500-dollar dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Revealed in “60 Minutes” That The FBI Investigation Of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Opinion
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh as Supreme Judge will be held at least a week later than originally. The question is whether the outcome of the investigation may unsure Republican MPs enough not to support Kavanaugh.
In a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, after the charges came out, and I asked, ‘Did you do that?’
His response was clear and clear.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete-proof.
"I've already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take extremely serious accusations to change my mind," Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the allegations,” said Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have substantiated the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, begins on Saturday in New York City, and stars from around the world will perform to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will be held for the seventh time, and tens of thousands of people are expected to fill the Great Lawn of Central Park, where participants will not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, a project run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by engaging more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
Free tickets can be given to those (unless they are even willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a senior politician, a phone call or any other meaningful activity to raise awareness of the project’s goal: eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert ticket to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they have contributed to a case by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter post?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by the project’s supporters, serving a wide variety of purposes.
These actions have helped global leaders allocate <0x24>37 billion to policies and commitments to fight poverty, which could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which <0x24>10 billion had already been paid out or raised during fundraising.
The group estimates that the money raised directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors to “help children reach their full potential.” The organization pledged Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from “global citizens.”
"With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put social injustice and malnutrition in the footnotes of history books," Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children in more than 5,000 actions, the government has allocated funds to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions posted on the Global Citizen website is “Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?”.
The Global Citizen’s response is: “There will be a long and difficult road where we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because together we will be stronger.”
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will also perform at this year’s New York event, with hosts Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. would use naval “blockade” to hamper Russian energy exports
"If necessary," Washington would even use the Navy to prevent Russian energy supplies from entering the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke said Russia’s active presence in Syria, especially with regard to Russia’s operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, was only an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they’re only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Interior Minister, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America can, with its navy, ensure that sea routes are open and blockade them if necessary to ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in roughly the same way: by using existing energy sources and by introducing new ones,” Zinke said, calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy,” pointing out the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why senior officials in the Trump administration, including the president himself, are persuading Germany to back off the “incorrect” pipeline project called North Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so fiercely opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we share the same view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be given the freedom to choose their suppliers," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt to convince the Americans was backwards, as Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to stay away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a problem when a third country interferes in our energy affairs,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), said after a recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts is “seriously considering” running for president in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she “would seriously consider” running for the presidency after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and redress a dysfunctional government, and it’s time for a woman to become president,” Warren said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.”
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he believed he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has outspokenly criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a poll published Thursday, the majority of Warren’s Massachusetts voters do not believe that Warren should run for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Political Analysis Center and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren “with a good chance” said the senator should not run for the presidency, while
Thirty-two percent support Warren's candidacy.
According to the survey, the majority of respondents would support Deval Patrick’s nomination for the presidency, with 38% of respondents voting against him.
In the 2020 presidential elections, senior Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont were mentioned.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to run by January.
Sarah Palin's Track Palin's PTSD Referred to at Donald Trump Meeting
26-Year-Old Track Palin Served in Iraq for One Year After Approaching in September
He was arrested on Monday night on domestic violence charges.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are going home with," Sarah Palin told the audience at a Donald Trump summit in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's son's arrest was described as "the elephant in the room," and he said that his son, like the other war veterans, "returned hardened, hardened, and constantly wondering if he has due respect for the service their comrades, pilots, and all the other members of the army have rendered for the country."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said a report said Track Palin had committed domestic violence with a gun and drunkenness.
18 member states and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
Eighteen member states and Washington D.C. support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy that does not allow asylum for those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is attacking the policy in court, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, was not disclosed.
The plaintiff allegedly abused by her partner and "its sons of violent gangs", but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
The woman is in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors from the countries that supported Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the places from which many asylum applications to the United States come, as they are a constant problem of crime gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) to allow undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “will ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be judged on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter reads.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that the policy of rejecting immigration is detrimental to the U.S. economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill in the lowest-level jobs.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country on grounds of race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political belief, or because of a well-founded fear of persecution," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum is not designed to solve all the problems people face every day around the world, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, death toll doubled, rescue teams race against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while reassuring her febrile son at one of the evacuation centers in Palu.
Ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have any drinking water."
Some residents returned to their demolished homes to save the wet things that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are unable to take care of people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside the hospital building due to the severe aftershocks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he recalled the fifth-floor hotel room, where his wife and daughter were staying, shaking into the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I’m stuck in the walls that have fallen,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of using propaganda ads
The U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited an advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – last Wednesday while accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6. China denies the accusation.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections mark a new stage in Washington’s ever-intensive action against China, according to some U.S. officials who told Reuters.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertisements, there is a growing trade war between Beijing and Washington, where more and more tariffs are imposed on each other’s imports.
According to US and Chinese experts, Chinese tariffs in response to the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for several cycles, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses as the state of Iowa exported significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in a commentary in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that “China continues to harass our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the highly cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“But if we go to a newspaper dealer in Beijing, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all faithfully reflect the different, diverging views of the Chinese people on the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that "one of China's most reputable newspapers refused to publish" his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts say it could be counterproductive for many high-ranking Republican politicians to defend Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, on the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, losing support for women voters in particular before the mid-term elections.
The incident provoked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be taken back, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona would be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
“Women will never forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.
According to Mic, some protesters in the Senate hall on Friday morning shouted, “November is approaching!” because the Republican-controlled Justice Commission, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump tremendously,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Many people say it’s already been very high, and it’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban insecure female voters and young people (aged 18 to 29) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Before Ford made his public statement, analysts had already assumed that he could backfire on the Republicans if they continued to stand for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford's testimony has detailed why he accuses the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
"The Republican Party has fallen on a slippery ground," former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be nominated, but also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities for Democratic Elections in the United States.
However, it seems that Americans are quite divided about whether they believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony to be true. Kavanaugh is believed by a little more people than Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony completely or more, and 35% of Kavanaugh responded to the same.
Additionally, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh was likely or certain to lie in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed that about Ford.
As a result of Flake’s motion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as is another of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Deborah Ramirez.
A week ago, Ford swore in front of the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had abused him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they were both studying at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web would launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
With Solid, users can choose where they want their data to be stored and who can access the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “to gain dominion over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application with Solid’s technology allows people to create their own “personal online data warehouse”, also known as a POD.
It can include lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available from the same browser.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who has access to their data.
The company refers to this as “the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over data”.
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, said the company’s mission was to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team will not ask Facebook and Google “to introduce a full-scale change technology that would turn their business models completely upside down overnight.”
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission was “to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of Solid’s new network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played an important role in the debate on internet neutrality.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann Victory Crusade Minister of World War I Celebrated
The only Anglican pastor to receive the Victoria Cross celebrates his hometown 100 years after his heroic deed in World War I.
Reverend and lieutenant-colonel Bernard Vann was honored in the attacks of 29 September 1918 on Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he could never know that he had earned the highest honor of the British Armed Forces.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two grandchildren at a Saturday ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the memorial stone was given exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deserving act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "in the midst of a dense fog and fierce cannon and machine gun fire."
Later, he hurried to the front line and took the lead of the battalion with "exceptional heroism", then stormed a camp cannon squadron by himself, destroying three of its members.
Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never get up to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72.
After a parade with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, wreathed the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he felt honored to play a role in the ceremony and added: “The bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the number of people who show their respect later on.”
MMA fans watched Bellator 206 all night long, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine you were watching Bellator 206 all night long, and the broadcast was canceled.
The San José show featured 13 matches, six of which were broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK as part of the main competition.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, to the surprise of the English audience, the game was replaced by Peppa Pig.
This was the reason why many people stayed up until the early hours of the morning.
Instead of the MMA game, a fan tweeted that the children's cartoon was "some sort of sick joke".
“According to state regulations, the channel will no longer be able to broadcast such content at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Communications and Marketing at Bellator.
"Yes, it's Peppa's pig time."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker has promised that the schedule of the show will be revised to take UK audiences into account in the future.
"I think we can solve this problem by repeating it," Coker said.
“But since it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, until our Sunday, which is already Monday, we can’t fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched on, there were a lot of messages coming in, and, well, most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But that's not what we were talking about. We had a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
There will be only five games in the program instead of six so far – we really wanted to please the spectators, but we made a mistake.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Tom Daley said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation, but that he was motivated to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said she stood up for gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, missed several months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, Daley, who was invited as a “shipwrecked,” said that when she was young, she felt “less” than anyone else, because “it was not socially acceptable for someone to love both boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, it is the feeling of inferiority and differentness that I draw the strength and endurance to achieve my successes.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal jumper has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of her participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia, has called on governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke on the matter because he felt fortunate to be able to live his life openly and without negative consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and her 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year and said the age difference had never been a problem.
“If you go through so much when you’re young,” he said — he was at his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — “it’s hard to find someone in his own age who’s had similarly extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, according to Daley himself, completely subverted his attitude towards the world.
"If you asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal," he said.
“But you know what I’ve figured out? There are things more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley’s statement, his father did not want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't answer him, 'Dad, you're not going to be in the front row,'" he said.
“I held his hand when his breathing stopped, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping at the Olympics in front of a home audience, there’s no better feeling than this,” he said.
He was inspired by the song Heather Small Proud (Pride) which helped her to prepare for the Olympics, and she still gets goosebumps when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 CET on Sunday.
Mickelson was out of shape and was on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson may set a record by taking part in his 47th Cup match at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays for the record 12th time in the biennial event, but due to his performance in four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday, team captain Jim Furyk put him on the bench.
Rather than being at the center of events with five victories in major tournaments, as so many times has been the case when the United States had to fight for victory, he is now cheering for his team one half of the day, spending the other half practicing on the pitch and trying to correct the flaws that weaken his game.
At the height of his career, he has never been one of the most accurate batters, so the 48-year-old player is not really comfortable with the tight court of Le Golf National, where the high grass cost a very high price for wrong batting.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, in Sunday’s ninth game, Mickelson will face the punctual English champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans with a four-point gap start strong before the 12 individual matches, then Mickelson’s match could be decisive.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of his role in today’s development, he patted my back, held me in his arms and promised that he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
– Extremely confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
Basically, I didn’t have two matches for him.
I had planned more, but in the given situation, we decided that this was the best option.
He wants to be on the track like everyone else.”
Mickelson's appearance on Sunday will break the record of Nick Faldo, who has never played more matches in the Ryder Cup.
This will end a series in the Ryder Cup that is far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk stressed that the veteran player’s presence would not bring any tangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him, and it’s good to see that.
Its presence goes beyond the strict sense of play."
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their gains.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, which holds individual matches, luck can easily turn its back on them.
The Danish player made his first debut in a game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, and by the end they barely managed to keep a hairy lead to a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“We must always remind ourselves that despite our great advantage in Valderrama, we only won a hairy win and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after his 2018 class 5–3 victory on Friday and yesterday, leading him to 10–6 on the Le Golf National circuit.
“It’s enough to think about the races of the previous years and everyone can see that the game isn’t over yet.
You're gonna have to play full force tomorrow.
So go ahead and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on right now.
“As I said before, I’m mostly dealing with the 12 players on our team, but we also need to look at the other side, who happen to be some of the biggest players in the world.”
Proud of Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s performance on a difficult track, he added: “I would never make predictions in a situation like this.
Tomorrow is a different day.
Then it all depends on individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It feels great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand out individually, every aspect of it reveals what kind of golfer you really are.
That’s what players need to understand, so that tomorrow they can get the best out of themselves on the pitch.
They have to break away from their partner, who will also have to come in his best form.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the opposing team, Jim Furyk, expressly trusts that his players will perform better individually than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last day’s resurrections: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then he was on the losing side after the European team’s “medinah miracle” accomplishment.
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked about how he had inspired the players before the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
“We have a 12-point game tomorrow, but we’re going to have a fast start, as we’ve seen in Brookline, as we’ve seen in Medinah.
If one team really pushes in, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent’s players in the middle of the game.
“We have put the order in order and we have prepared our players so that they can perform a real miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with taking the lead in the attempts to reverse the position and playing Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I chose this order because I believe that this is how the picture is composed from the beginning to the end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added to the individual line-up.
Germany's newest warship is again postponed
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it will be in service at least next year.
The inauguration of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", was postponed in the first half of 2019, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit wrote, citing a spokesman for the army.
The ship was initially scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the continued delays made it very difficult for the large-scale project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class ageing frigates.
We know it will be equipped with high-fire cannons and various anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and camouflage technology, including signal dampers that reduce the ship’s radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these newest frigates can be put in service for up to two years away from the parent ports.
However, due to the ongoing delay in the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may become obsolete when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 was on the front page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to dedicate the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
Not much information has been revealed about the reasons for the return, but the German media has cited several critical “software and hardware errors” that render the warship useless during a combat mission.
Software shortcomings are a major problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg-class warships, which is only half of the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was extremely overweight, which impaired its performance and prevented the Navy from making further modifications later on.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as a class of ships set up by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), while the initial project projected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of the warnings that Germany’s maritime presence is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently admitted that the Navy “is running out of ships in readily available condition.”
According to the official, the problem has become a self-sustaining process since the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the drop-offs.
He expressed concern that not even one of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats.
New research is being carried out on a Scottish Highlands estate to find out how bats exploit the landscape features during hunting.
The researchers hope that the findings will provide new information on the behavior of unique flying mammals, which may be useful for future species conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will study the behavior of common and soprano dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special recording devices are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
By analyzing the sound of the recordings in detail, you can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species are doing.
The researchers will also create a habitat map and report that will help to determine in detail how the behaviour of the animals will evolve depending on the landscape.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal what are the most important habitats for bats and how they are used by species.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
The size of bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the past century.
Construction and spatial development work disrupt the sleeping areas of animals and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, just as they are exposed to fly paper, certain chemical processes used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not completely blind.
However, because they are nocturnal predators, they rely more on their hearing than on their sight when hunting prey.
With their sophisticated technique based on ultrasound reflection, they are able to determine the exact location of insects and the landmarks in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies and sleep site inspections and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
According to manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“There’s a great place for bats in Threave,” he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, and thanks to working here and in other areas like this, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also highlighted the importance of making sure that bats are present before renovating the buildings, as the destruction of a single plant could result in the death of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and their destruction, harassment and habitat disturbance are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for help from the public.
"There is still much that we don't know about bats, and we have almost no information about the population status of most domestic species."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “false news” and said that others wanted to use his name to “get in the public eye.”
The footballer's lawyers are ready to sue German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese squad member and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
She said the athlete paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
A few hours after the charges were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million fans in an Instagram Live video that the news was “a lie.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
“What they told me about me today is a lie,” the five-time gold ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get in the public eye.
These things happen.
They want to be famous by my name, that's the life of public figures.
I’m a happy person and my life is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Due to allegations that have been called “an unacceptable suspicion of breaching privacy,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the player will file a claim for compensation “for the moral damage caused to an extent appropriate to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years.”
The incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete’s suite where the man had sexually raped her, according to documents filed with the District Attorney’s Office in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him he was a “99 percent good boy” with the exception of “one percent”.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but said it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police station and had a report of his injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was “fearing retribution” and “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to revoke the agreement as the trauma caused by the incident continues to make her life miserable.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to be transferred from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will "forever regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will "forever regret" the loss of its position as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Enterprise Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK was “concerned” by a statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car manufacturer would be forced to temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses due to delays at borders.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis production plant in Burnaston last year produced 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have expressed concern about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Minik manufacturing plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “on-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and other EU countries.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, cross-border disruptions could lead to production delays and spare parts shortages, according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store spare parts for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire and production would have to be stopped.
Clark said his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was “precisely assembled to avoid delayed checks at the border.”
“We need an agreement, and we want an agreement on the best possible terms, which will not only benefit from our current success, but also offer new opportunities,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to keep our supply chain working very well at the moment.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would last, but it warned that the costs could undermine the long-term competitiveness of the plant, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and now represents the Unite union, trade union members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, jobs that are lost at this time will never be recovered.”
One government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House said
“They may postpone another week,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump said in a statement, as the debate over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court candidate continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian influence in the elections, possible links between Trump’s advisors and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months, Washington has been speculating whether Trump will eventually fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
According to the New York Times of this month, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting with a wire to record a conversation with the president, and the question was raised whether there was a possibility of replacing Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what had been said.
However, he visited the White House last Monday and there were rumors that he was going to file for resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then appearing before the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “unwillingly” dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: “We don’t have a set date yet, we can set a date for this week, but in the light of the case at the Supreme Court, I see a chance for another one-week postponement.
It will be revealed soon, and I will, as always, inform the press."
However, some journalists were sceptical that Sanders had not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of press conferences was not caused by the “sensational” behavior of television reporters, but added, “I do not dispute the fact that they are indeed sensationalists.”
He then suggested that direct meetings between Trump and the press would take place more often.
“The president gives more question-and-answer interviews than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without corroborating the claim: “We’ve looked behind the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, light-years are better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, and there have been many such occasions in the last few weeks, so instead of the White House press conferences, you can talk to the President of the United States in person.”
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are quite rare.
Why, perhaps, can be inferred from what happened this week in New York when the president performed an unusual and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the journalists gathered.
The head of the health ministry addressed a letter to NHS Scotland’s European Union workers about concerns about Brexit
The head of the health ministry said in a letter that the country was grateful to the staff of the Scottish NHS, who came from European Union countries, and that he hoped to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s expected withdrawal.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the costs of applying for the status of EU citizens in a decentralised public service.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit continued and a decision is expected to be made in the autumn.
The UK Government has also begun to prepare a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a disturbing time this may be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts of each and every member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise to support the work of the Healthcare Ministry, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is also your home and we would very much like you to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31–27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before mid-term.
"He walked down to the coast and just collapsed," Reed said.
The coaching team and medical staff first provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the track, then put it on a stretcher and took it for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he had “no further details on the type and extent of the injury” while Tennessee State was working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-long second-year student, spends his first season with the Tennessee State team, to which he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he showed a total of five successful setups before leaving the track, so he is already at 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on properties purchased in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on properties purchased in the UK, and the additional revenue from this will support the homeless.
This move would neutralize Corbyn’s success among young voters.
The tax increase targets those who do not tax in the UK
The State Treasury estimates that this would result in <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in annual revenue to be spent on supporting the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on properties purchased in the UK, and the additional revenue will be used to support the homeless, Theresa May is about to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to offset Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase will affect individuals and companies that do not tax in the UK, and the extra income will be used to fight homelessness.
The surcharge to be added to the current levy, which is calculated in addition to the higher levy imposed on the second dwellings or real estate purchased for spending purposes two years ago, can reach up to three per cent.
The State Treasury expects revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK citizens, causing significant price increases, making the situation for first-time home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the country’s wealthy districts have become “ghost cities,” especially in the capital, as many foreign customers spend most of their time outside the country.
The bill came just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in fees to help young people wait for their first home.
He personally blames construction corporations for keeping real estate prices high, who have become accustomed to buying and abandoning land. He asked May to abolish quotas imposed on affordable houses and to do something about the “home shame” that has emerged in the country.
Corbyn announced remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including rent control and the elimination of unjustified evictions.
In addition, it would provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year, I said that I wanted to dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and making life better for each generation.
The real estate market needs to be addressed.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals living outside the country or companies with foreign interests should be able to buy real estate just as easily as hard-working British citizens.
“Dreams from home have become almost unattainable to too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to be the manager of the Scottish team"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "highest wish" was to be the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of reviving the North-East club, which is currently ranked third in the first league, just three points behind the first.
He moved his headquarters to the Stadium of Light after successfully returning his St. Mirren team to the Scottish Premier League in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserves," Ross said on the Scottish BBC's Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my dad, and something always pulled me back to them.
But now I have a chance to succeed as a club manager.”
Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not worried about being forced to follow in the footsteps of such big names, and has previously rejected the offer of both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I’m measuring my success right now by whether I can get the team back to the first division.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly in the first-class league, he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I’ll only see my activity here as a success if I can get the club back.”
Ross’ managerial career began just three years ago, after serving for a while as a deputy coach for Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Aolla to recover after the team fell back into the third division and with St. Mirren on the brink of the elimination, he won the championship title in the following season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than he has ever felt in his playing career, whether for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a decisive moment,” he recalled his time as coach of Alloa.
“I clearly thought that being a manager was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done it well, I've lived it quite well, and I've even had some really memorable moments.
However, the life of the players is sometimes very difficult.
There's a lot to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks lie at my fingertips.
I’ve always been interested in being a manager, and now that I’ve tasted it, I feel the best in my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound’s Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to a study, beer is best served at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
During the summer heatwave, the traffic of pubs in difficulty in England increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under great pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenues of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of CGA, a business consultancy that compiled the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunshine period and England’s longer-than-expected World Cup presence, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase in revenue, with the difference that restaurants saw even greater declines.
Restaurant revenues fell by 1.8% in June and worsened further in July.
Pubs and bars selling mostly alcohol were the best performers, and the increase was even greater than the drop-out at restaurants.
Pubs offering more food were also unpleasantly affected by the prolonged sunshine, though not nearly as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Apparently, people are more inclined to drink at this time.
The revenue from beverages in the pubs and bars operated by the companies increased by 6.6% this month, and the revenue from food fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for leisure and catering, said: “These results have been following the trend since the end of April.
Weather and major social and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and the annual revenue loss of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only be over time to see if the temperate weather we experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well.”
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK’s catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is widely accepted as an industry benchmark, collects and analyzes performance data from a 47-member group of operators with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children (as young as 11) have a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta-pages" is growing
Fear of sharing sexual content increases as a result of the news
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that their parents could see
One in five children (up to 11 years old) create a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta-false accounts" refers to the Instagram photo-sharing site is growing rapidly.
As a result of the news, fear of sharing sexual content has increased.
Twenty percent of students said they had a flawless "main" account that their parents could see, but they also created private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a profile of a teenager who said, "Rape me."
According to a survey conducted by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of Digital Awareness UK and independent school directors, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the Board’s annual meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, said the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade would be an invaluable asset to sports decision-makers.
“Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletics community, and his presence will contribute to the development of Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am delighted to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to really help the Scottish sports leaders.”
He won two of his four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in 200 metres and 400 metres, but was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary cerebral circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time I would decide if I was going to get better.
With a challenging job, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again, today I am going to agility training!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
A breast pump ad that resembles mothers to cows shares the online community
The advertisement of a breast pump company comparing nursing mothers to milk cows has been heavily debated online.
Elvie claims to have developed “the world’s first silent, wearable breast pump” and advertised the product in an ironic advertisement evoking music videos, demonstrating the freedom that the device gives mothers who milk their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed full of straw, while the lyrics in the background read: “Yes, I milk myself, but I don’t have a tail” and “if you didn’t notice, these are not breasts, but my breasts.”
And the chorus is like, "I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm milking the girls."
The advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page quickly became a cross-controversy online.
The video has reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of mixed responses. Many say that the advertising is ridiculing the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s very tasteless to advertise the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to their offspring, but their calves are taken away from them within days,” one commentator recalls.
The Elvie breast pump can be discreetly placed in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says, “Yes, it’s terrible for both the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast pumps to mothers who can keep their children?”
Someone else added, “Totally insensitive advertising.”
Others defended the ad, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “awfully funny.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have bought it if I had still breastfed it.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a silly commercial, so I'm not trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commentator said: “This is a funny advertisement at work or in a toilet for mothers who milk their milk and feel like ‘cows’.
The dairy industry is not praised or condemned.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they had the discreet breast pump in their bras all the time while dancing.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women who use breast pumps sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires or tubes, and can be discreetly placed in a breastfeeding bra, so women can move freely, hold their baby in their hands, or even move out while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and Communications Director of Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product and had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallels between dairy women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast pumps and make it funny to show how our breast pumps give us a sense of freedom compared to that.”
Elvie's breast pump isn't the first time it's been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two stepped on the runway wearing Marta Jakubowski’s clothes while using the product.
Hundreds of Child Migrants Secretly Relocated to Tent Camp at Texas Border
The number of child migrants in detention has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and measures taken by the Trump administration so far making it harder to find host homes for them.
The hosts themselves are typically illegal immigrants, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be worsened if they applied for children.
This threat further increased in June when it was announced that host parents and adults living with them in the same household would be required to give fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“80% of the applicants and those living in the same household are illegally in the country, and a significant proportion are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the proceedings involving children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of the current 60 days, the social workers say.
Many people log in to the court via videoconferencing calls instead of appearing in person to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge fails to provide legal protection, the immigrant will be promptly deported.
In recent months, social workers and people working in the system have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the chances of violent outbreaks or attempts to escape increase.
According to rights defenders, these risks are only increased by a larger facility, like the one in Tornillo, where the number of children makes it harder to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if children were not given enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before being transferred to such a facility, they would be exposed to even greater trauma.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces'
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, has called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland in spite of the eight-year civil war in the country.
Moualem, who also holds the position of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had entered Syria illegally on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and that “this is how they will be treated.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the General Assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would “continue its sacred struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “an illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for their return, and that only “certain Western countries” were creating “irrational fears” and discouraging refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the return of the population,” he said.
“They turned politics into a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major insurgent citadel, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a large-scale attack on the three-million-people province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement sets “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military actions would be directed only against jihadists, including the Al-Qaeda-linked An-Nusra Front, which “must be rooted out.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be convened to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and the elections.
Moualem also called for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, for example, to “revise certain articles of the current constitution” and warns all external actors against interfering in the process.
That's why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true and a prosecution or scandal puts an end to his presidency prematurely.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential final of all time.”
For now, however, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN’s mainstream viewing has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its viewing to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in mainstream time, instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC is the most watched cable show with a 3.5 million audience, which it reaches on the evenings of major news days.
“We’re drawn to something like fire because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the executive producer of ABC’s drama series The Designated Survivor, in which a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the chair after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, said in a statement.
This is how he recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” asked Scovell.
“It makes me laugh,” the driver replied.
This is the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very small group of people can ignore these facts.
But it’s no longer part of responsible information when we’ve been watching for six hours a debate about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book Fear, or about the <0x24>15,000 ostrich coat of Paul Manafort’s (“consequences of incarnate arrogance,” as The Washington Post puts it), or about it.
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, I'll always think about Super Mario.
“It’s a bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of ‘Pension Stars’. The characters in Trump’s show are constantly changing and new twists and turns are coming every day.
If you miss one part, you’ll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26 degrees, sunny weather in Kauai, and yet he was in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from television as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Justice Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, many people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were kidding, but they were right.”

Both parties pour money into the tightest competitions in the mid-term congressional elections
It did not surprise anyone that in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, both parties are spending their money countlessly, after two active MPs were fighting for the same seat after rearranging the congressional districts.
One of the competitors for the recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburban district is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which has a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district boundaries had been manipulated to the benefit of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties' funding body, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), almost bidding on each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after winning the March midterm election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by Republicans for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district with a 20-point advantage.
Political experts say Democrats have a better chance of winning.
The U.S. is considering sanctions against El Salvador because of China’s support and has withdrawn from the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
In June 2017, Donald Trump was in a good mood with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the leadership team of the Trump Organization.
The State Department has recalled senior U.S. officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their recent decision not to support Taiwan, ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
Sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid, including for the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, such as cuts in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would be a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary goal of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will also speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue any condemnation or sanctions.
The White House spokesman, John Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the dispute, which were reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next blow could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has obstructed justice in any way... and a number of facts that have been made public suggest this.
Mueller’s investigation also allegedly covers whether Trump’s team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the election.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they will certainly try to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the verdict of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertainties, and Trump’s fall is far from inevitable... nor is it the fall of his European principles.
Serious decisions need to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how long the fight will take.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to take Hitler, just waiting for the West to join the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
Support was lacking, so the bloodshed could not be prevented in the years to come.
At turning points in history such as this, it is decided whether the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein overseeing Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been swaying since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested recording conversations with the president and suggested that Trump was unfit for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is: in the interim elections, are we going to vote for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of us.
I hope that’s not the case, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once lived in my ambassador’s home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on a swastika table during the Sabbath.
How can I be pessimistic about our future with such a cultural heritage?”

Graham Dorrans plays for the Rangers ahead of Rapid Wien
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. A victory against the Austrians after an unexpected draw against Spain's Villarreal can secure their participation in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play until the 2–2 match against Villarreal in the season, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can set more daring goals for themselves.
“It was an important point against a great team, Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
We thought we could score a point, and we got a point.
We could have scored another goal at the end, but we can’t complain about the draw either.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
There will be another major European match on Thursday.
I hope we get the three points, but it won’t be easy, because they were pretty good in their last game, but with our fans behind us, we’re sure to have the strength to win.
Last year was pretty hard, I got hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is good.
I hope that if we give our best, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.”
Many Women Worried About Not Saving Enough for Older People
The survey participants had an accurate idea of what old-age care they wanted, but only a small number of them talked about it with their family members.
According to a nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t raise the issue,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
The following is worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take care of you properly if you don’t tell us in time what your needs are.
Together with your advisor and family, choose where and what kind of care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on future costs.
Recruit a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for your planned care.
Funding can be done with a conventional old-age insurance policy or a life insurance policy combined with a hybrid savings policy that can cover your expenses or use your own assets as cover... if you have enough resources to do so.
Prepare legal documentation: In this way, the possibility of litigation is cut off in advance.
Entrust a representative, a trusted person, who acts on your behalf on health issues, oversees your medical care, and ensures that everything goes according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to manage your finances.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and take care of paying the bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Record these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
“It’s not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who the doctor is,” Martin said.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home after his evening program.
The 40-year-old victim was attacked in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, with a gunshot wound to the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting as a “accidental act” around 2:30 local time.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed on Friday when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu, according to the authorities.
The communication network in the area has also been damaged, so there is no news from the province of Donggala, north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people had to be evacuated.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital of the province of Palu Central Celebes, built on the western coast of the island of Celebes at the end of a narrow bay, in 2017 it had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by the earthquake and tsunami.
The province of Donggala extends more than 300 km along the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
The governorate, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is primarily characterized by fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami on several occasions over the past 100 years.
A tsunami in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are frequent.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive sea quake began off the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing a total of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, killing more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake hits the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s largest island, and a tsunami following it killed nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake rocked an island in the Mentawai archipelago near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami in some places that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A quake near the surface hit the governorship of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The panic and devastation that followed evoked many memories of the terrible 2004 tsunami.
The tsunami did not occur this time, but more than 100 residents died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular tourist island in Indonesia; a powerful quake killed 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed, and thousands of tourists were stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, is suspected of having committed domestic violence, obstructed the reporting of domestic violence, and resisted arrest, state police said.
According to the police report, when a lady friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Prison and has been given a <0x24>500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and, when asked about his guilt, replied that he was “not guilty at all.”
Palin has been charged with three class A offences, a maximum of four years in prison and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence, which could result in a one-day imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has a clash with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction to report a crime, as well as with possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man had punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 when she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people have died in the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake on Indonesia’s island of Celebes.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Systems responsible for power and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of deaths is likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are a lot of videos on social media about the tsunami.
Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami reached the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the eight deaths in New York City, has not been executed since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old man, was accused of driving a Home Depot-rented truck on a bicycle path on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway in October, hitting a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and “went to cause injury,” according to a statement from the New York Southern District Prosecutor’s Office.
According to the file submitted, proof of either of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight orders of extortional murder, which until then had been used almost exclusively against organized crime, as well as the damage and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack “required significant planning and premeditated intent,” the prosecutors say, and Saipov described it as “horrible, cruel, inhumane.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time a New York City district asked for the death penalty was a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009 for the murder of two drug dealers.
The last time a New York federal case was executed was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, did not show any regrets in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he said he was pleased with what he had done.
Saipov said the ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, according to the indictment.
Police say he asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s state defenders, said he was “understandably disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
“In our opinion, a real life imprisonment for a confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all the actors involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders have previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their defendants.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage said during a demonstration at the Tory conference that he was “calling the people’s army to battle.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after a party colleague of Theresa May suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who did not hold any office, told participants at the Birmingham summit that the UK “would have left long ago” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
It is well illustrated by the intra-party pressure on May that the pro-remaining Torys have spoken out in the city at another anti-Brexit demonstration.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a permanent exchange of views between Brexit and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between his package or “total chaos”.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that the "Chequers deal" had to be stopped.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be brought to the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have left already,” he said.
The wellingborough MP added: “I will stick with Brexit, but the Chequers deal has to be over.”
Criticising the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to be the slaves of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone dismissed the assumption that public sentiment had changed since the 2016 vote: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay.”
Pro-Brexit Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and said to journalists: “All I ask is, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with party membership, and especially with activists working on the ground and helping us get to government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
As a corner message to May, he added: “Only a prime minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.”
Farage said politicians should “feel the pressure” to dare not betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, between the people and our politicians, is at stake,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
He said: “I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel the pressure.
We will call the army of the people to battle to win with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom an independent, independent, proud country again.”
In the meantime, the Pro-Residents marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Some activists waved the flag of the “Toryk against Brexit” movement formed this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis praised the Conservatives for the security flaws in the party’s application at the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, a border crossing without interruption, and a borderless free trade agreement with Ireland,” he added.
- They're just messing around.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren “considers” to run for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the election in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future at a public forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for November’s re-election against the state’s Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been some speculation that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th Citizens’ Forum meeting with voters since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was “time for women to play a role in Washington in redressing the failed government, including taking the highest position.”
A man suspected of shooting Sims in LSU has been arrested
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an 11 a.m. East Coast time press conference.
A video of Friday’s shooting was released earlier, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was killed by a gunshot near Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the gunshot, which proved fatal," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde intervened in defense of his friend, when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and he was arrested at the East Baton Rouge district police station.
In Baton Rouge, a grown-up who was nearly 2 meters tall, Sims played 32 matches last season, 10 as a beginner, playing an average of 17.4 minutes per match, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel thanks to team instructions
"After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole position and almost got Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first stepped into the boxing alley and let Hamilton get stuck behind the midfield, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes stood out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a close-up action during which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner arc free after moving twice in the third corner as a defensive.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the start blocks and was seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then drove most of the race because he didn’t change his tyres so that he could quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of fourth place.
He finished in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, making Räikkönen fourth.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The team has made an exceptional effort to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally after the senator insisted that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the new Supreme Court nominee, of sexual harassment.
During the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but merely noted that what was going on in the Senate proved that the people were “villies, abominable and liars.”
"What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, mean, hateful, and liars," he said.
“When you look at the statements and the leaks, you say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, hold on a second.
“No, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“You asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as you requested.”
However, his denial did not seem to be accepted by the president, who said at the Saturday evening meeting: “I’ll tell you what the situation is: his body language was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by the three women of sexual harassment, by claiming that the Democrats were using the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by whatever means.
“You can see the vileness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
With a 5:3 victory on Saturday in the Dundee rematch, the Dundee Stars apologized for their defeat against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
With the help of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants gained a two-goal lead early on.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team, after which Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
François Bouchard offset Dundee's loss, and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat in the season, defeating Dundee 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two sides met for the fourth time in the season, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored his opening goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's goal pass, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the opening third round, Sullivan brought the home side back to the game at 13:10, before Cownie equalized Matt Marquardt's pass at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants could march for the break when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team rearranged their ranks and Bouchard scored again with a man-benefit goal at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran's collaboration helped Nielsen take the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second third for the first time in the game, and then ensured victory with his team's fifth goal in the final third half.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, returned home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers lost their lives in order to save hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero who lost his life while making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than eight hundred people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck Celebes Island on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many are trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues escaping saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was already on the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought he was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard the news,” he said.
Authorities fear that the death toll could be thousands, and the country’s disaster relief agency said the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The number of casualties is likely to continue to increase as many are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached," said the organization's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft transport assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are bringing new bodies every minute.
There is little clean water.
The shops were looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who arrived in Palu on Sunday, asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, killing more than five hundred and fifty people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing in plane crash in lagoon
An airline operating a plane crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing, although it was previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew had been successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini’s press release, the situation on Sunday afternoon is unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been transported to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are unclear.
According to the airline and the US Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane flew very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jayne said.
Jaynes said that, along with others, he was able to hit the sinking airplane's emergency exits by force in water up to the waist.
According to him, the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors repairing a quay nearby also helped with the rescue and brought people to shore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters under the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline crashes involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugin.
An analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented the defendant at his retrial, accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analyst.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to compile the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
According to Rowlett, he received location data from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, which contradicts his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to cell phone records, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers’ death, Tellis had deleted her text messages, phone calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He took him out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio challenged the negative attitude surrounding the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to Bristol’s The High Breed, hip-hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have regained popularity in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues for dismissing a party after a “racist” message
A New York nurse filed a lawsuit against a couple for their dismissal on grounds of discrimination after a mother sent a wrong message complaining that they had been employed by a “black” nurse.
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she saw the woman black on her first working day in 2016 when her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
“NEEEEEEEEEEM, THE BLACK IS ALREADY AGAIN!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he realized his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unpleasant,” fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing nurse, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was more expecting a Filipino.
They paid Ms. Maurice a day's work and then sent her home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for his dismissal and is asking for <0x24>350 a day for the six-month residency for which he was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them how to stop, you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice’s application because they feared they could not trust him after being offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
"We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone who, even if by chance, was rude to you?
Your newborn?
Come on!
Plasco, who likened the lawsuit to “extortion,” said his wife had only given birth to the baby two months ago and that she was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would you attack someone like that?
It’s not really nice to do that,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process is underway, the public court has already swiftly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
According to a newly discovered letter, Paddington’s publisher feared that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to put ourselves in the place of someone who reads for the first time before publishing it.
This information is fun enough now that we know what a huge success Paddington is.”
According to him, his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he felt inspired to write a children’s book about a little teddy bear, would not have been resentful if his work had been rejected, then he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was bittersweet after his father’s death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, not at all arrogant,” he said.
“But because Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a kid doing something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really our merit.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he created it and it emerged from his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When he landed, he and his daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for his life in vain.
“He called me regularly to tell me that he was in a very bad condition and that they didn’t expect him to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad saying that my daughter would die in the next two minutes, and I have to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating, slowly ran out and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn’t leave myself.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others, who ignored the trial she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head, and all the time my tears were falling.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.”
Postcards with mourning women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys postcards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and her smile stuck on everyone.
He knew everyone’s smile.
I was always told that her smile would lift up any place."
But before he died, he gave up his job because he was “in a very bad condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was constantly worried that this was going to trigger some kind of domino effect.”
Ms. David created the postcards with the goal “to let people know that some people can be contacted and spoken to, even if they are just friends.
Don’t sit quietly, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies' girlfriend for years, lost Mark, who was her life partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
She was devastated on Christmas Day: when the children opened their gifts, she didn’t look them in the eye and all that.”
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge void in the family.
It broke our hearts into small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is questionable as the FBI opens its investigation
“I thought if we could achieve what he asked for — a limited-time, limited-scale investigation — we might be able to reach an agreement,” Flake said Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of “breaking to pieces” because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is solely due to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to not perform well, it will be much harder for them to get their men to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him he also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to have Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dissidents “diminished” under Kim
The number of North Korean dissidents heading to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszek cited data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said there were 1,127 dissidents last year compared to 2011, when the number was 2,706.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not commented on this information publicly.
The majority of North Korean dissidents will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China accepts dissidents as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between the North and South, which is still virtually at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came at a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they largely agreed on further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the American people, there is no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances it is inconceivable that we will unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" but says he's unfit for Supreme Court
Minority House President Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said his behavior was not appropriate for working at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I unwittingly thought that if a woman behaved like this at any given time, I would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in a statement to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested against rumors that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming, and his voice drowned when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and coordinated character killing,” organized by angry liberals after Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was unfit to work at the Supreme Court, showing that he was biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he’s locked himself out with his statements and behavior against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he held the position and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m telling you that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not fit for the Supreme Court, you’re not fit for the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would alter the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court, and he expects us to burst with joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to hold it in hand.
It's a legitimate outburst, a rage that has been accumulating for months and years, and it can't get out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s so rare, do I?”
She told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique where she said to her interlocutor when she started crying in anger, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
Tears are partly tolerated as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories was from an early job, a male-dominated office, where I once began to cry in my angry helplessness that I had been grabbed by a woman older than my neck – a cool manager I had always feared – and took me to the staircase.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they managed to upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair with a hair named Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in deep frustration, figured out that there was no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and they wanted another candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone called him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, Ms. Schroeder was lagging behind in raising money, so she vowed not to enter the competition unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men <0x24>1,000, but he only got <0x24>250.
“Did you think I’d get a discount?” he thought.
When he held a press conference not to launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the gratitude to the people who supported him, and the frustration and anger over the system that made it difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, that his throat was squeezed.
“They might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted.
“They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Do I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone?
“Crying?”
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening fire of the U.S.-China trade war was almost deafening, and while the battle is not nearly over, experts say the break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warnings earlier this year by imposing a tax on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, as the new tariffs already affect <0x24>200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing has backfired, most recently imposing tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to strike back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If he wanted Washington to back down, that would mean he had to give in to the demands, but the public bow to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, China’s president.
Still, experts say, if Beijing is tactical, U.S. trade-war pressure could benefit China in the long run as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into an economic turmoil is far more serious than was previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, Asia Research Assistant at the New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said the country’s state of affairs was improving.
“The current situation is more stable and safer thanks to the achievements in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who have had to flee between terrorism and arbitrary economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
A further six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state welcomed any assistance to rebuild the country.
But he underlined that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team at 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National outside of Paris.
For the sixth time in a row, the U.S. has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, dropped his punch in the water at Par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been shining in every round, making him one of the four players who have ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated the European team’s lowest player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen, with 5&4.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have won his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, have won the tournament in Europe with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after his emotional victory in Europe.
The baton is handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods and growing up watching this man,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only preceded by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing result, U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said, “He’s proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're rearranging our team, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us.”
