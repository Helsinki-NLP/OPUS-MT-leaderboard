Four members of the Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the underworld of Estonia, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was arrested in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday, the court also detained three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organization, aged between 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug-related crimes.
An alleged leader of a criminal organisation has been arrested in Mijas, in the province of Malaga, Spain.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom, according to the data collected, is the leading figure of a criminal organisation and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggests that there was a clear division of responsibilities and roles within the criminal organisation.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal association was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal proceeds," commented Vahur Verte, the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We do not exclude that the number of suspects in this case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been subjected to law enforcement in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with his Spanish counterparts has been an important part of the investigation.
“International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of cooperation,” said Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Department, Ago Leis, said the detentions were preceded by a criminal investigation that lasted almost a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realized and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officers helped with the detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civilian guards.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other side of Europe," he said.
The information gathered so far unambiguously indicates that while at liberty, the suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court approved this.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
As part of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure seizure.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Central Criminal Police’s Office for Organised Crimes and are managed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion in 2005 and sentenced her to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich from Kemerovo rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly roof tax.
Joint international operations, confiscation of proceeds from crime and enforced judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, recent judgments, eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association, from whom EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds were confiscated, or a judgment against nine individuals for the creation in 2006 of a criminal organisation, Igor Aleynikov, aimed at the illicit trade in smuggling cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Viru and Southern Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated there is approximately 71,500 euros.
The success in these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information on a daily basis with foreign colleagues and prosecutors exchange evidence and, if necessary, carry out joint operations in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The statement reads: “The NAACP travel note for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, urges all African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when traveling throughout the state, given the racially suspicious events that have recently taken place here and across the state.
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning by both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win lawsuits against discrimination, and the fact that the state law enforcement is targeting unequally minorities.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received complaints so tightly before."
This is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults to black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared, whether it’s taking out bail money or informing relatives that they’re going through the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in the 16th place in the nation in terms of the number of similar offenses.
A travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as this, according to ACLU, would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure in response to certain domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D, and E.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have a malignant course, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e., liver creases and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, epidemiology adviser at the Health Board, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray faeces, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also derives from the popular name of liver inflammation jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can pass without symptoms.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can be determined only on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Hearing Cousin highlights the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, stools from an infected person to and from the hands to food, surfaces, objects, ingress into the mouth, and use of drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis A infection includes the family members and carers of the affected person, people with chronic liver diseases, people who have sex with the infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, and travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented, in particular for those who travel a lot and are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving devices), having sex with a donor, a person suspected of hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B disease.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms for contagious sex or the prevention of risky sexual behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of household items contaminated with blood, having sex with a donor, a person suspected of hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a fetus/newborn child.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, people with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The preventive measures for hepatitis C include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and needles, tattooing and pierced, and the use of condoms for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted through contact with blood and other body fluids, needles and syringes contaminated with them, through sexual contact and rarely from the infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are transmitted via faecal-oral drinking water and food, including eating low heat-treated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes, and infected mother-to-fetus.
Passengers can become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high levels of disease.
Preventative measures for hepatitis E are compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid using drugs.
While competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the last round, 34-year-old Farah found strength on the final line and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn’t think long, dragging her husband Tania and the children on the trail after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was amazing,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth consecutive 5,000 and 10,000 metres gold double in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dame in Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" dives much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
But more deeply into history.
Perhaps a harder cutting axe, a narrower theme would have made the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title more impactful.
Today, between the covers there are two books: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted by Gustav Klimt and his painting "Dame in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the vibrant cultural life of Vienna, and those who found themselves in the Austrian capital can easily imagine how life was going around the Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads when Klimt walked in at the Central Cafe.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and when you see the name familiar in the book, you feel more grammatically cultured.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city with an incurable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or maybe even - every pair of brush strokes adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dreaming of traveling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten residents of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele wasn't drawn to all the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at "Dame in Gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of life, this noble lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his husband from Klimt, he was the last-minute hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt’s order cost 4000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of a master's love affair with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certainty is that the close relationship between the model and the artist, which emerged during the work, lasted for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Dame in Gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before working with Adele, Klimt had been to the San Vitale Basilica in Ravenna, and researchers believe that it was the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dame in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting, Kiss, was born.
Art historians did not overlook the similarities between the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with it?
"I think in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his work available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
He left his jewelry to his nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed drawing.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to his failure to be accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria's will had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find works that were pleasing to the Nazi Party from the rich collections of Jewish art in Vienna.
Some of Adele’s home jobs, but not Klimt’s, fit into Hitler’s personal art treasure.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
If you see "Kiss" in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, you have to go to New York's New Gallery to see "Dame in Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you don’t plan to go to see Klimt’s work, at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish subjects after the book was closed than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for <0x24>135 million.
So not so much a portrait as a family fate story - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree, mentioned in the beginning of the book, facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In life swimming, Gold was very close to his personal 200m backstroke record at 2.16.62.
The top mark comes from a 17-year-old girl a week ago, when she was 2.16.58 in the Canadian Junior Championships, says Priit Aavik’s Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to reach the 10th A-final.
In the final, he passed the distance with a time of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new top brand.
From the Estonian record for Alina Kendzior (2.15,13) Gold was separated by just over half a second.
In Estonia’s all-time rankings, Gold came third, and its new personal top mark is Estonia’s fifth all-time score.
The young hope for the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle in a time of 2.03.22.
This distance was last swiftly floated by an Estonian woman in 2008.
Only Estonian record-breaker Elina Partyka has swum this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
An Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in 100 m freestyle with a great personal record and a new Estonian season top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, one year older than him, has only swam that distance a hundred times faster.
He reached his personal top mark in another 100 m backstroke, receiving a letter in the opening of the announcement of swimming time 1.03.69.
In the semi-longer distance, he won seventh place, swimming in the final at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
It’s time for the holidays—that means relaxation for U.S. President Donald Trump.
Since Trump has been one of the presidents who has taken the most holidays, critics are sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend 17 days on holiday at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president’s holiday began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been talking about the holiday for a week.
They are accusing Trump of taking too much rest.
Presidents usually spend weekends in their villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Trump has not been the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was on vacation for 21 days.
However, things are quickly overlooked by Trump.
Days after he became president, Trump said on the “60 Minutes” that there would be no time for long vacations during his term of office because there was a lot of work to be done.
Three years ago, he also expressed his indignation over Barack Obama’s holiday.
The president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting off the heads of journalists.”
White House officials say a 17-day visit to a golf club isn’t exactly a relaxation.
This is officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time to read or do other favorite activities.
There had to be another reason for the leave.
The air-conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House was replaced, and therefore all staff had to leave.
The West Wing also houses the Oval Office and other offices of the President.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you can see in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Don’t Candidate for a Government Office If You Can’t Stand Voters’ Criticism
Our country's father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him up for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that “freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in silence and silence we may be led to slaughter like sheep.”
This brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
Earlier this week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor's officials stamped the action as void and the web commentaries were swarming with counter-reactions in the style of "Who's Interested?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval rate is the second-best among the country’s 50 governors.
Hogan's not an unthinking responsive punkhead.
He has ruled the state on a firm hand, and he has adhered strictly to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as his main tool for communicating with his voters quite skillfully, for example, by displaying his bald head in a fun way for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, blocking people visiting the governor’s page, which is an officially labeled public forum managed by taxpayers’ dollar-paid staff, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor’s behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, spammers, or a hateful crowd on the web.
The Post spoke to a number of real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are: real people communicating with their elected leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and by no means obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hatred, but rather hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary to The Post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, someone will call it an indifferent collective effort instead of admitting that it’s a lot of concerned citizens.”
What the governor's officials called a "directed spam attack" others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, when workers had to be dispatched to do the same to collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first government official to be criticized for denigrating Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant judgments on this matter was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment of the Constitution by blocking a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable shipping costs had the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous writers suppressed his way of managing.
And even then, Washington had to face anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, overturning Washington’s decisions.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of George Washington’s online letter-collection project, his office was buried under petitions that criticized his views on friendship, trade, and shipping agreements with the UK.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the cornerstones of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty relies on the comfort of home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European premier, Ronan Rafferty hopes to enjoy the comfort of home territory in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was driving the last lap on the neighboring Archerfield Links lanes last year before surrendering to Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will replace Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club, as an ambassador to the tournament.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we're seeing the club shine in full shine with this event," Rafferty said.
“The players see the track in its best shape, it’s in brilliant condition.
Jerry has done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This makes it possible to showcase the track perfectly.”
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't defend my title at the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the calendar a year after I won.
It's magic to come back to this area.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember memories from last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year’s victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour early this year at the age of 50, is also returning to the competition.
This is his first event in Scotland since his participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“To play at home is always a little more meaningful,” said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing again and have shown a fairly decent game of golf.
I am happy with the progress so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Sam Torrance and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 for a car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He rarely even uses the pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai regency of Papua Province, Indonesia, a housewife puts a sweet potato called nota in the local language directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coaled tuber is removed from the fire and eagerly stabbed into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor with no furniture, and at the same time he does his daily household chores, such as washing laundry with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
The toilet plays the role of a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous, however, most of the village men are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to go to the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated under Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum that forced only 1,026 elderly people to vote by raising their hands in front of the troops.
The movement to get rid of Dutch domination quickly turned its rage against the government of Jakarta, which still maintains its strong control of the region by keeping away foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to the independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is both a remote and abandoned place. To get here, you have to fly from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabire for 90 minutes, and then take a five-hour journey that will make you feel nauseous by renting a car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with wavy iron roofs, rust has turned different shades of yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, and there were hardly any foreigners here either.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuas of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," Degei says, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we wore only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s gold-rich land.
Just 100 kilometers from Paniai, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants, is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of timber supplies estimated at USD 78 billion.
Yet, these riches are the source of the suffering of the Papes, as they result in the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid about <0x24>20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to <0x24>150,000 per officer.
The aspirations of the Papes for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the highlands of Papua tribes in the 1970s were a genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the area.
The Birsbane Archdiocese's 2016 report "We Lose Everything" contains testimony to atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one other report says rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“The number of victims is difficult to count because such incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian investigator at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened even more because Papua’s natural resources have caused an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan family caterers sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, which is served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market at a lower price than local papayas," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital for work.
"Indigenous Papuas Mama-Mama [women] are losing their market share as a result."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won his way to the presidential palace of Jakarta in 27 of the 29 constituencies of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," You said.
In fact, Paniai was in a low position just two months after Jokow took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, eleven children in Enarotal were singing Christmas songs by a fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the darkness on a motorcycle.
The children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said drunken soldiers were chasing children and beating them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
Around 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military control center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting vibes and performed the waita dance of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and mimicked bird songs.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military.
When the displeasure escalated, the soldiers were sent an order via internal radio. "If the crowd shows more than three times resistance, shoot them," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine but not issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), an elder in the Kego Koto district of Enarotal, felt the threat and called for peace by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"While turning around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his vivid colors on the porch of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from ranks of assembled soldiers.
"There were many people, there were many gunshots," he added.
A local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told Time magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the security of his precinct after it was attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves if we are threatened with death," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua police.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and pledging to address the abuses in Papua.
“I want to solve this case now so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for resolving human rights violations.
Apologies were also made almost immediately.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdrew, saying he had no intention of setting up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything will be settled by the law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including those in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with bitter distrust.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to autopsy this incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniai's neighboring county, Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when a dispute broke out between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, a 24-year-old man who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the building site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at police officers, to which the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were panicked, afraid of revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injuries being recorded.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the discontent of the honey, moni, dani, and damali tribes living in Papua’s verdant mid-mountain land.
Many of them have joined the rebel army of the Free Papua Movement (VPL), which claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by occasional attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state", has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniai in recent years.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic forgotten place".
Poverty fuels discontent.
The small amount of rice sold at Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow their own food mainly in sweet potatoes, along with a little bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between native Papuas and new migrants has deepened since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist will go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuas themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are neither jobs nor money here," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices", although they were granted a rare filming license.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, Jokow’s election promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
“Journalists in Indonesia who are trying to report on the most disturbed provinces in the east of Papua and Western Papua face new threats of visa refusal and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of a glimpse into the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to its closest neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries, Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a variety of widespread crimes" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have historically also supported the VPL.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, dismissed the group's allegations, saying to journalists in Jakarta, "Democratic order and freedom of the press still exist in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury the evidence of human rights violations."
The local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country’s human rights ambassador Kees Van Bari, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people who attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous interrupted their silence, according to a source, urging: “We want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuas do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," said Hobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to understand that not only do the people of Paniai live under the threat of a predatory army, but they are also suffering misery because of their poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other Papuas, consider their vote for Jokow to be a debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims managed to bury the body of one of the victims in a land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be brought to justice, they do not allow at least those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The Dubai Torch has been fired for the second time.
The fire swept through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection officials said the firefighters extinguished the flame around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and chilled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outside of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Board after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was done by the facade coating – decorative panels and insulation of the exterior.
British police have said they believe the isolation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed some 80 people.
Watch: These Phones Will Probably Be Sales Bestsellers This Autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because that’s when phone manufacturers unveil their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were launched in the spring, and new hit phones are expected to be launched in the fall.
According to Tele2’s Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an iris scanner, a edge-to-edge 4K display and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 was a great source of excitement in the technology world, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart.
Autumn promises even faster charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and increased water and dust resistance.
He added that it is possible to make assumptions based on rumors and predict four top models that are likely to conquer sales charts this year.
These top four smartphone models will be on the market this autumn.
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to arrive in mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 didn’t bring any significant differences compared to the iPhone 6s, on Apple’s 10th birthday, it’s expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous ones.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen, which covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple’s design director, insists that the new iPhone model should look like smooth glass.
There is also a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the iris scanner, wireless charging and an even higher quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-ordering of the Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said to have been designed for even more business users, and the S Pen enables even more functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide-angle and the other with a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is certainly comparable to the quality of the iPhone 8.
We are looking forward to August 23.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones with the Nokia 6 at the forefront this year, their flagship, the Nokia 8, is still missing, and will be unveiled on August 16.
We look forward to Nokia’s 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display, the ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, Nokia’s new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by the company Zeiss.
While Sony’s strong flagship so far has been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are looking forward to a smartphone that is a bit more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better camera.
It has been speculated that Sony’s new model will have a screen of at least six inches.
What the reality will bring will be seen soon, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post unveiled transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump phoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president broke the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump set up his presidential campaign pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing an intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. would take on refugees headed to Australia is “laughable,” “cruel,” and “stupid.” He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama’s administration would leave him with the “slight” impression that he had proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that it was “the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Lines in a case where the City of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree that rejected OÜ MRP Linna Lines’ tender for the Tartu bus procurement because the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Ahuttin, the head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Lines appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not proceed with this.
While many people on social media complain that the noise from the Weekend Festival disturbs their night’s sleep and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that the party in the store was so polite!
I didn't see any blurryness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the pearl Laine.
"It's nice to be coming, being and feeling joy from Pärnu, which is like hibernating in winter," she adds cheerfully.
Wave's sleep is not disturbed by the bumpy waters on the beach.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was played on the beach, but now the music has not reached his home walls yet.
"But I hope I can hear it," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who has also spoken with <0xC3><0x95>htuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu – it helps the local merchants’ turnover a lot.
He is also delighted that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The noise of the party doesn't bother a woman.
I’m not going to the beach anymore, but I’m glad the beach is alive.
And it's good that people are moving, and it's been three times already," she says.
The first time it was a bit worse.
“Maybe there were complaints,” he thought.
However, the noise on the beach is, according to him, common to the summer capitalists.
"This weekend is a very good promotion for our little town," says Harri, who is playing in the park.
Noise and rioting have not affected his rhythm of life.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Thinking about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
A man with loud music will not be crushed.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
“Good people can stick together and there’s no trouble,” he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite, he said.
“They’ve exaggerated a little bit with the bottles, of course, but the young are young and, oh my God, let go, but be people and we’ll get through this!” he said.
By that time, the coastal residents have travelled somewhere far away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina, who walked with the children in Pärnu.
His family’s sleep is also not disturbed by the music of the festival, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer it was a different stage, so we heard more.
We live outside of the city, so it actually sounds pretty good to that far from Pärnu river,” he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education firm Pearson said Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address the business’s impending strain.
The job losses, which are likely to be made redundant between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring, according to CEO John Fallon.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (<0x24>394 million) in the third cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid digital learning transition.
The company, which agreed to sell its shareholding in Penguin Random House last month to its partner Bertelsmann, said their expectations for the year have not changed since it announced a 1% increase in sales revenue to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion took place on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-made explosive".
According to the statement, all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a source of serious concern for NATO forces in Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% are in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the city center killed more than 150 people – the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S.-led overthrow of the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the Smoke Regulation after the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the decision to delay the Obama-era regulation that obliges states to limit smog-causing emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency for this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozone Measures" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to have dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to postpone measurements of ozone levels, which measure smog pollution in different parts of the country, in order to determine where its levels should be reduced by one year further to October 2018 in order to comply with the stricter air quality standard.
Fifteen predominantly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, claiming that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, saying this is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But these aspirations have sparked counter-reactions among Democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA’s website states that inhaling ozone-containing air “may reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of respiratory diseases” such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a celebration as heavy rain threatens the harvest of the second-largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be that the weeks of rainfall before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feeding animals.
"Wheat quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, which is twice as much as normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers as well as their European counterparts have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which have continued in August.
Many have turned their eyes to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area hasn’t even started harvesting yet, local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
"These are quite difficult days," said Frank Deckert, a senior trader at Ceravis in Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, perhaps the clever whims of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays a role in the interiors of fair houses, as the large windows bring the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa to many (living) rooms.
Every step of the way, our northern neighbours are striving to create both crisp and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
The Finnish people’s ability to use wood as a building and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty objects deserve admiration and adherence.
Inspiring techniques and smart solutions can be found in fair houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is clear that black, white and gray shades, when supplemented by wooden tones and indoor plants, can be very cheerful.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair will last until 13 August.
Supplies and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
On the night before today, a line was drawn for this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix did everything in his power to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd was really on the turn during the performance of Garrix - singing, wailing, dancing in a self-forgettable way.
When Garrix finished, the crowd was scattered from Pärnu beach to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the photos that our photographer took during the weekend.
You must be one of them, find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on the collision course to face the most engaging boxing match of the near future in the weight category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the closetweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision to defeat former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters ranked among the top five in the leaderboard.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday at 7pm at ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg] but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he has to move upwards with a lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether watching it should be paid for. This is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class by the end of this year, in order to make a possible meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauti), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match in Forbridge after their lightweight match on 23 September.
"Watching this fight could be pay-per-view because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offered the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go see his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it knocked out."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the strength of the punch and then to box.
They both said they felt the tension between them growing.
“It’s a fight that’s waiting to be realized.
No other encounter brings so much attention and excitement.
I’m more than willing to work on that,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight.”
Which parts of the world are moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, if last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
The authorities are unable to say how many immigrants will eventually stay in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis is carried out by the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year ten years ago, in recent years this number is starting to approach 2,000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – last year, more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that people are looking for work and study opportunities in a country where the community and many people are already in front of their families," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and in Tunamullu, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
While Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens come here because of family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a researcher at the Academy of Internal Defence.
"When you look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have moved to live, Ida-Virumaa is immediately after Harjumaa," he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens were granted a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permit decreased.
“The hype is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to move to Estonia,” said Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for many years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to facilitate the stay of adapted people.
A long-term residence permit, for example, requires five years.
Because of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Ukrainians can now change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer follow up on whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became very popular - applicants last year were still holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people were granted a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has been 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become surprisingly a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for a residence permit in Estonia.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come to Nigeria to study at the universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian nationals has increased largely due to study migration.
The rule applies to them, too, that where a community has emerged, it is easier for others to join,” Rammus added.
Over the past ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, and as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6,000 third-country nationals are granted residence permits per year, that is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if you add the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at around a percentage," Maasing said, commenting that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people emigrated to Estonia last year, while 13,792 people emigrated to Estonia.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the expats and expatriates are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the expatriates.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative with 2000 people last year.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.

The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem strange to some, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I made.
Because it’s not her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses, and she does!
You can make your life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and the gray everyday.
This was the reasoning behind the plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to people that fashion often does not reach.
Mammu’s collection was presented in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where 45 models filled the street with royal defile.
In Tallinn, people often take a stand, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you hand in hand.
Most of the audience just came to review, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they will be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion makeup.
In Pärnu we had a 50-meter-long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, it seemed they never end!
Maria also refuses to admit the fashionable fact that the creation must be presented to a supersale supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
Often I invite my own clients to the stage - they are always happy to come.
It's such a fun experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my show, I’m always behind the scenes to give things a final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to sit back and watch.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be hand-in-hand in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I’m never far from my job and I’m not afraid of my job.
It’s not just about design, stylistics, logistics, organization, organization – it’s all about fitting a temperamental woman’s day.
These hours are huge for fanatics.
I can’t tell you when my day will end, it’s just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and yet in turn, compliments.
Several times I’ve been told that my dresses have magic – they make me feel like a princess.
The abundance of tully satsi lines that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp from U18 boys: the gun of the Estonian subgroup tournament has now been turned against us
I'm sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing we noticed was that we couldn’t get to our table.
And if there’s such a big difference at the table, there’s nothing to do,” commented Martin Müürsepp, our only basketball player in the NBA, on the 61:75 loss of the Estonian U18 basketball boys to Britain.
The opponents took 28 balls from the assault table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We weren’t prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it did.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build a defense.
In defense, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It broke the team's legs.
Opponents' homework was better done.
In the opinion of the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to reduce the momentum of its opponents.
Even in the last quarter - we had zero errors, but our opponents already got several quick baskets.
The athleticism and tight pressure that was our weapon in the sub-group tournament turned everything against us now.
Today, we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason remained at peace with his subordinate in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, you can say good words about the whole team in the tournament, to this day there was a single punch.
It is a pity that you have never met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has been carrying quite a heavy load.
But he did some pretty nice moves I've seen in training before," the instructor added.
The women’s basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the European Championship.
In the U18 age group, only the young men’s basketball tournament of the EM B-division will not take place in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin yesterday.
Unfortunately, Estonia’s game with Poland has been in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter the score was 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their foot off the accelerator pedal and that period ended at 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points and in the third one points.
In the beginning, the Estonian women hit two of the first four throws in two minutes, then 25 by the game, then one in three, and then 21 more throws.
In less than half an hour, one of the 47 shots was caught.
In addition, there were 2 out of 4 free throws.
There was a reasonable number of shots at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, and on the opening day Portugal’s 83:56 supremacy had to be acknowledged.
NATO ships arrive in Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent anti-mining group arrived to Tallinn for a scheduled visit to the port to replenish the ships’ stocks and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for returning to the sea and at the same time give crew members the opportunity to take a few days off.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosives.
"Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and their collaborative training in local waters illustrates our integration with the Allied forces," said Major Arto Reinmaa, Commander of the Operations and Planning Department, who is in charge of the naval fleet.
Since 29 June, the 1st permanent anti-mining group of NATO is led by the Latvian naval commander, Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group commander at a ceremony held in Riga from the Estonian naval officer, Captain Johan-Elias from Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaiti, on which the group’s command staff also operates.
This semester, the Mine Hunter Sakala of the Estonian Navy is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships under the command of the NATO Naval Command, NATO’s 1st Standing Mine Control Group is a standby unit that can be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, initiated 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost (36), the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet replies from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" and there is also no lack of self-production, this time with Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "Asanajad" directed by the same international creative team that brought Pir in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It’s bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes over and never really lets go again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klasi's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klasi, it has been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course it all goes to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klasi that also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival at Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival, what do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, to our surprise, the first ballet written for the story of Astrid Lindgren will be presented.
That's "Karlsson flies."
And one curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
Apparently, he has had Karlsson’s character alive since he was a child.
Risto, how are you doing all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a bunch of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, or how I cope with every new day.
And this kind of consciously keeping my tone, keeping my positivity, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important tests, I have been especially eager to practice it and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don’t think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe has to offer them, but each one of us is gradually discovering it.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you step into the conductor's remote?
You have to change clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don’t get a chance to rest or take a nap before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to interact with people actively, even before I stepped into the director’s desk.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here’s something to discover for a not-so-great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden, asylum seekers were tested to assess their age with a novel medical approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated over 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing early this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more accurately when applying for asylum after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Institute has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Institute assessed that the test subject "may be 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference from the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large number of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, the person had directly stated that he would be 18.
This medical age estimate method, which involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and an MRI of the knee joints, after which they are examined by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose duties include assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they passed puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reasons to think about it and I don't think the measurement method we use today should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
"If we can't say with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Institute defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of categorizing a child inaccurately into an adult is low.
The highest risk is around 10% if you are just under 18.

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the World Championships in London with 67.37.
Organ was the youngest female hammer thrower at the World Championships, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately scored my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear.
I was looking for my discharge, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s debut at the World Championships ended with a good 18th place.
The rainfall did not disturb Orel, because he is training through the winter at TUT stadium.
"I'm terrified," he said with a little grin.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel perceive the people around him, or was he able to turn himself off?
I know, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it’s going to give you more – that’s what it is!
When you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be happy with his debut at the World Championships and that he will have a lot of good competitions ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old, and that's the only thing that matters.
I'm going to take a good experience with me and some days I'm going to be competing for medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he and President Trump would change parties.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me,” Justice said.
"Today I tell you, after much prayer and reflection...Today I tell you, West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
There was joy at the gathering.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the state’s only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that it owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from its father.
It is worth about <0x24>1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday evening that “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from improving again than working for it.”
"Just 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - the governor's announcement is simply the most recent denial to a party that is run from start to finish and unable to find a positive and unifying message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It’s no surprise that where there are so many people, there are so many injured.
Urmet, who was working at the medical tent at the weekend, told <0xC3><0x95>htuleht yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
Bladders and abrasions are basic, out twisting and light falls.
Also, of course, head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that is how the problems come.
Medical personnel have also had to assist a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been a few panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, we'll send the bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe praises Russians for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the international head of athletics, said he praised "Russia's honest apology for Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not the time to allow the country to re-enter the sport.
Russian athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in athletics that the ban on competitions imposed on his country is correct and he has a firm goal to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who have been stolen gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competitions imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“Today I think it was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian sub-federation itself acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and that they are doing everything possible to reorganize the sub-federation."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own rehabilitation.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that now is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can to normalize the situation in the next few months.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF team, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of criteria for restoration.
Following a report to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls are still inadequate and the banned coaches still operate freely.
The electric car revolution is changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution dramatically change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win in one place and lose in another, smaller mining companies won’t be helped.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will grow.
This year, the governments of the UK, France and Norway have stepped up their efforts to ban the sale of new cars that use fossil fuels.
As a result, Volvo Cars has already announced that it plans to abandon its internal combustion engine, and Tesla is launching a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that more electric cars will be sold than oil-fuelled cars in the next two decades.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranin, a commodity analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has been increasing for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as conventional cars, Glencore said.
More copper will be needed at charging stations, which is estimated by Exane BNP Paribas to increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for batteries for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore’s revenue from the growing electric car trend will come from the rise in copper prices and being the world’s largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
Cobalt has risen 70 percent on the London Metal Exchange this year.
Last year's price increase was 37%.
Copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 percent in London, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losers' side, lead companies like Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to the new era.
Lead is mainly used in batteries that power starters in petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This poses a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found to serve another purpose to overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, Head of Metal Market Analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Lead price movements have not yet had the effect of a loosening trend.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best metal in London in terms of price rises among the most important industrial metals.
Investors will see problems with metal in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
This may happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust emission standards mean an increasing demand for hybrid cars that depend on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine start-ups, according to the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel because a lighter car can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand for 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium gum already in 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world’s aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
The price of aluminium has risen 13 percent this year due to growing demand from car manufacturers leading to a shortage of the market.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is collaborating with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce amazing lightweight car bodys.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium mummies.
"Overall steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as a catalyst for diesel-powered cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
"Many currently high-demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not be in high demand in the future," said Natixis raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over a period of 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers expect continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said in a statement that more hybrid cars will be sold in 2025.
The big hope for the platinum producers in the 10-year perspective is the hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos that rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially proven.
"Diesel seems to have a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas Brunet.
German car manufacturers were hit hard in July by a Stuttgart court banning diesel in their hometowns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How Football Finance Rules Affect Neymar’s Transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from making a world-record transition from the Spanish football club Barcelona to the French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from the UEFA, the governing body of the European Championship, which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still awaiting Paris Saint-Germain.
The Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of moving Neymar to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise that kind of money to recruit Neymar and add him to the star-rich lineup, given that the team is funded by the ruling family of the Qatar energy rich.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business with their own.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This ex-French player believed that clubs that fall into high debt in search of success actually engage in fraud and risk ruin if banks or owners should give up their support.
Since 2011, FFP has been focusing on tracking club losses rather than debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a potential club and then make a big expense to make the team better and create a global brand - will be more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini’s disgraceful rejection from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is definitely not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP supervisor, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s buy-in clause in a single payment, it has the possibility to split that amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show the transitional fee as an annual amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44,4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi's Manchester City, received the heaviest penalties.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (currently <0x24>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This is what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG had been inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar’s PSG service could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant about any attempts to disregard the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed Neymar's transition with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation with PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG made more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million profit in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 per cent in connection with the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to block Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's view that the club is being funded by the state.
"This is a consequence of ownership rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said.
“If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
"It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play because a country may have other ways or interests to represent such a big player."
Norwegian, a Norwegian low-cost airline, has a nice tradition of putting pictures on plane wedges of those who have pushed boundaries in their field and have been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee.
With the expansion of Norwegian’s operating geography, the circle of people who earned a place in the plane wedge has also expanded.
Among the selected personalities are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, a plane will be decorated with a portrait of Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which roared on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage primarily to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
During those days the wind speed in North-West Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to the other in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and raging, like the end of the world.
In 2002, an old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu told Eesti Loodus magazine in an interview.
Linda’s husband saw the garden he had planted collapse.
But what do you do with your hands when you get through a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in from the windows," said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
Linda saw that the roads were full of trees and that the roof of the railway station platform had flown 20-30 meters away, like most Haapsalu residents, only the next morning.
Locals said the trees behind Paralepa were flat, some completely down, some halfway.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm passed through the beautiful old trees with rags and rags like war.
Lääne-Virumaa did not suffer particularly severely in the August storm of 1967 compared to western Estonia, but the damage was also great there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped from the face of the earth, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour, were measured.
On the evening of 6 August, a little girl in Merivälja, Tallinn, called out: "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down!", wrote Virumaa Newspaper.
The Põll manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was decided to be demolished later.
The constructions of the Türi ski jumping hill, which were later not restored, could not withstand the August storm.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the cleaning work.
Crop fields were also severely damaged by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party organisations must be both inspiring and guiding in the renovation and harvesting of crops."
Hurricanes can occur when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for wind breakouts in Estonia stands from 2 November 1969, when the wind speed was measured at 48 m/s in Ruhnu.
The instrument broke on Vaindloo island, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret of Clean Beaches: Night Cleaning and Bad Beach Weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort at the beaches of Tallinn.
“If there’s weather, people are on the beach, and if there’s no weather, there’s no people,” said the beach cleaner.
Seagulls are screaming at the North Tallinn’s Stroomi beach.
They are faced with melodic competition from a low-running tractor that plows stripes off the patch.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimeters, collecting marine debris and human waste: bottle caps, cigarette cones, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, director of beach cleaning at Haabersti Administration.
It's 6:30 and there's a lot of cleaning work on the beach, because at 8 o'clock the place must be in order for the people.
Usov's at work at four o'clock.
Besides Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beaches.
Waste volumes have decreased.
Years ago it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usav, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
When something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
We are now looking for what is on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian beaches is cleaning up the sea garbage that has been washed ashore.
At Pirita Beach, for example, 400,000 tons will have to be transported during the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second big category is household waste, that is, everything that people leave behind.
The half-mile stroom beachfront has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
However, colder summer weathers have meant that waste is one-fifth less than otherwise.
The third type consists of abandoned objects.
Mostly it's children's bones.
As a prey this time, Usav has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but this is a normal harvest." Usav already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The garbage is scattered
The representative of Haabersti administration services, Erika Scholler, admits that the work of screening tractors disturbs the locals.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, disrupts the sleep of the neighboring people.
During the day, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler says.
However, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the aim is to get Stroomi Beach under the international blue flag quality label.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," Scholler says.
We have more plows and rocks and harder to sift the sand.
There is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, uncompromisedly joins a circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle collectors who have pulled the garbage bags upside down," Martin says.
While it’s hard to expect people to be able to change their previous behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the trash cans and put lids on them, for example, to prevent at least the birds from going there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi beach.
The city is taking care of it.
With children's courts, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, there was only one road for roller skates,” Martin notes.
Treasure Hunter's Discoveries in Stroom: Coins, Only Coins
Dimitri, a 40-year-old treasure hunter, is combing the shoreline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything worthwhile today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," Dmitri says.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails, which later throw in the trash.
Usually there are coins.
"There are usually no gold, rings, or anything like that," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted to keep the 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signaled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in loan costs may be needed in the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago to partially withdraw the mammoth package that boosted the economy as a result of Brexit.
The bank will close a fixed-term funding scheme in February, which provides cheap funding to banks, although it said that a <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion increase in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion is now expected under this scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says: "In the medium-term projection of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
Regarding the rates, it was reiterated that a "slight tightening of monetary policy" is necessary to alleviate inflation, to a "somewhat greater extent" than was anticipated by the markets.
The stock market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The forecast for 2018 for growth of 1.8 per cent remained stable.
After this news, the pound dropped against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have dampened growing hopes for growth in GDP from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer households that are suffering from rising inflation and pitiful wage increases, saying that the situation will get a little worse before it improves.
They added that monetary policy could not prevent the impact on incomes in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by growing demand for British production, which partly offsets lower costs for consumers.
The decision comes a year after the rates were pushed to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully revive prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for a rate increase as inflation had increased the pressure on distressed households; in July, three policymakers demanded that the rate be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank it was expected and there will be another increase in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco’s mortgage brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more and more competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to close as refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is writing a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people.
Since September, patients have had access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that national health care now makes available an estimated 10,000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets, administered before intercourse, during the initial three-year clinical trial, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeals endorsed last year’s Supreme Court ruling that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency’s own claims that the drug should be financed by local governments.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed the move announced Thursday as a “new massive intervention,” while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a “turning moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. More clinics will be added in October before the program is rolled out everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are sufficient amounts of certain medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-infected partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can register at the participating local sexual health clinic as well.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and NHS England signed an agreement to get the drugs this week after an international tender procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: “This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
It is another milestone in over three decades of fighting one of humanity’s greatest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: “This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to reverse the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiation with a partner, thereby improving many lives through this NHS-funded clinical trial.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is promptly pushed across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the drug for the clinical trial of PrEP has been obtained, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister of public health, said: “The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and much delayed after months of delays and dragging the government’s legs.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can change the prevention of HIV and stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society.”
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, but decreased in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the exchange price of electricity between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices went up 12% and 7%, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 per cent of the last month’s hours of electricity moved towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not transact the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia 99 per cent of the time, and 73 per cent of the hours had all the transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions that took place on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price of electricity could be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, rose last month and transactions were made at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per tonne.
High-rise living - half-floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, exchanged her big Knightsbridge home for an apartment at Earls Court in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and re-sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be worth the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer that same day.”
Since our first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a sophisticated layout - to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
“That was my demands,” he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio at Erfan Azadi’s Notting Hill, to take advantage of 3.8m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where one could stand upright.
Erfan had to take a creative approach.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would sit on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to make both the upper and lower room heights right.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-heighted rooms in the room with ample dramatic elements.
From the half-floor, the old-fashioned copper light from the Retrouvius window opens over the glamorous living space below.
The golden furniture with a mirrored surface, the silver details and the retro luminaire by Serge Mouille emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and light abundance.
Mirrors are attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror closet provides storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The charm of the living room is added by the possibility to close the kitchen part when it is not in use, creating the image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is that it is a garage-type retractable door.
"It took some design work," Erfan explains the MDF door with steel reinforcement.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, the floor space is what you sell – or what gives value to the property,” says Erfan.
"A realtor enters a room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are the ones you touch that help create an emotional bond with your home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with a wire on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make your heart ring.”
It shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who competes with his colleague for a promotion.
Nothing counts but the amount of money earned, alongside which all ethics are forgotten.
His wife and three children are only seen early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that it’s a version of the business world of the House of Cards – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech engineer are similar.
The more the film continues, the less the frame-like element remains, and the filmmakers’ moralistic intentions become more and more prominent.
A life-changing experience becomes the protagonist's son getting cancer.
You have to choose between work and family life.
A son who dreams of becoming an architect, walks his father to Chicago’s large buildings and makes him think about things that are truly important, such as faith, goodness, love, and even a twin-tower disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, the filmmakers feel that the goal is to make the audience cry, because even the hardest-hearted viewer can’t hold back the tears when he sees the suffering of a dear cancer boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally realizes the immorality of his job and does a good deed for the old man looking for a job.
Now I'll bet on myself - if the movie has a happy ending, I'll reward my insight after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, I can praise the scriptwriter for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that I will miss the coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he runs slowly down the hallway towards the room.
However, his son has been miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, this is also a positive thing, because now is the time to take care of the family.
I also know how to predict the end of American drama.
To be honest, the film is well-constructed, with all the necessary elements.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring you in well.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media consumption.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House’s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information, including news, that reaches President Trump, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a flatter water.
Here's a snippet from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day of work, he pointed out a key problem in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he planned to solve by getting bad information into the hands of the president.
“Kelly told officials that the information had to go through her, either on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he’s in the White House, his TV viewing habits aren’t gone.
"When candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was honestly featured in the affected publications," former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “six former campaign employees said the key to controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stable hymn of praise.”
All right, all right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habits have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s tweets would have been even more stimulating without their intervention.
We’ll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his helpers were able to save him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing clicks, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be trustworthy.
In May, Politico wrote about the advisors’ tendency to feed the president strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react explosively to negative press, especially detrimental leaks, taking obsession with finding out their source.
That’s what happened at the end of February when someone delightedly gave the president a printed copy of an article on the GotNews.com website owned by Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Personnel Katie Walsh of being the White House’s “source of many leaks of information.”
It doesn’t matter whether Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to mockery, or whether he didn’t provide any concrete evidence, or whether he has also filed and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
“Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, and Rob Porter, head of the White House office, “have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump.”
How did you do that?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming to the capital from abroad do not get permission to perform bitterly.
There are a lot of foreigners in the city center.
Those with whom <0xC3><0x95>htuleht spoke admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without permission from the city government.
We first found three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with rattlesnakes and bursting clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a song with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to her juggled with three balls and called the passers-by closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on a backpack and smoked a self-made cigarette.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled the ball, said they were playing in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland on the same evening.
When asked if they had asked permission from the city to play music in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple of days, and in most cases permits are issued for a month or something like that.
There’s no point in paying for that,” Bob explained.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and chasing them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Centre to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet and the third had even carried an electronic piano with him.
"We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," Mivosh said.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that they must have permission from the city government to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
"Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we'll have to try," he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million under the public asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, while the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not disclose any details of the purchases.
In response to the interpellation of the members of the Riigikogu, the Governor of Eesti Pank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained that the asset purchase programme of the central banks of the Eurosystem covers three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank purchases bonds on the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the return on lower-risk assets, which motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases its own government bonds under the PPP, but no other government bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called buy-in within the amount allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds eligible for the Purchase Programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally purchases bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds as of June 2016.
As of June, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds will be purchased by the Bank of Finland on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore ditch and return to 'Millionaire District'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again faced a fierce confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored a ditch dug by the council to win back a field far from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field near Solihull Street, a wealthy “millionaire district”.
They have returned with an army of horses, children, and trucks since they were only expelled in May, without being disturbed by the ditch excavated by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the barriers, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section left as a pedestrian path.
Angry residents have cursed Solihull’s council, saying it is “useless in dealing with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being evicted from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council must be shamed so that they can take action, because they are useless in tackling the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They were there last night, probably more than that.”
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long seals to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I’m not happy that I have to continue paying the council fee if the council can’t even stop this kind of thing.”
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said, "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there's already another invasion going on.
This time the number has increased and even horses have been seen ruminating in the grassland.”
A spokesman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground in the countryside near Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with Solihull Police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
Evidence gathering will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them.”
The weekend festival will be visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is delighted that it has been possible to bring real world top names to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, the Saar responds that this should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival to the fullest for three days.
However, he admits that the real players in his field have come to Pärnu.
“When we look at the level of artists that we have been able to bring to Estonia, we bring home the absolute top names of this genre of music – that is not often the case in our area,” says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists performing at the festival speak the most about the island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stood up last night.
“We’ve all had our own feet at some point,” he said.
There are many other titles, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, and Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian actors too: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P, and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high,” he says.

Audi to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel cars in the middle of criticism from car manufacturers
The day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade for more than 350,000 vehicles.
The company believes that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including BMW’s home town of Munich, which have been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these actions as recalls.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles is increasing for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, which silenced the use of so-called deceptive devices that allowed the car’s emissions to be adjusted to the regulations at the time of testing, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of the engine development department of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former president, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused Audi of installing the system in order to circumvent European emission requirements, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a big blow to Volkswagen’s luxury car maker generating a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for 20,000 euros.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions will receive the European Union flag with dimensions of 105x158 centimeters.

Murder of journalist underscores growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the state of Sinaloa’s most recent chaos sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered under the guise of personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which seems safer: whether to bring the children to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names for each column without the need for evidence, impressions and intimacy are enough.
Being hired by the government or cartels is suspected of a whole list of villains, drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists who make it dangerous to portray the chaos in Mexico.
There is no breath-taking pause for violence, and the more dead bodies are piled up across the country, the greater the proportion of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under national protection since the attacks and threats, and at least seven out of seven journalists in the country have so far been killed.
Among the latter are their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez with his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice", and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 a separate state prosecutor's office was set up to handle journalist cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which reach thousands, journalist killers rarely come to justice.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderer data and justice, a security meeting would not be of much use, according to Ibarra.
“It’s stupid to waste your time at this meeting,” he says.
"Until the cause is known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is presumably due to the name of the newspaper, which translates to "the twelfth river".
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, only silence prevails.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival cliques struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that every day a few people are shot down in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is packed with abundance of decorated double drug king mausoleums that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is run by only one cartel.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce’s co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of the cartel, who competed with Guzman's sons and was at war.
Suspected gang members may have been angry with this piece of paper and bought all the copies as soon as they arrived at the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper editorial that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his assassination is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling <0x24>50 shares.
Bojorquez said in Sinaloa it was "impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem".
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that allowed them to read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) for his courage to follow Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on the task that comes with being a journalist.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths, or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who slandered like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love has been fatal to him.
His death has also made them question themselves about how to do their best work and survive.
“They don’t like you messing with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-control, even in the best of times.
Confidence in your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said: “The problem is that the smell can be cheated... and that’s what happened to Javier.”
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from the heat of 40 degrees in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard the Riodoce office in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters, half-joking, wondered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent police officers that the governor himself had labeled unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous rural areas where de facto drug gangs have taken control.
Riodoce’s weekly issue covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is a favorite place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in widely reported cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same location, including how the son of Guzman, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened before," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose skinny bodywork has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources have been interrupted."
The Valdez office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they never expected activists to do in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration against another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Burned body has been found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become louder and are scribbling the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest against pavements and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez’s death, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Afterwards, he asked that he be redirected from reflecting on the government's actions, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were “restricted” by organized crime, co-conspirating state officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who are involved in organized crime.
The media monitoring group, Articulo 19, attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico, you're going to die because they want you to be silenced," Ramirez said.
Murders are obviously bloodstaining.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, the northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his decapitated head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to let go, as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly spoke to the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page, "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's an annoying decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work and they still have to wander the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they’re being chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay still and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reporting on the drug business frightens her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on one recent Friday, when the latest issue had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank a beer when everyone’s phones suddenly began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in shootings between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From that side of the sidewalk, reporters used a mobile phone to post the news on Riodoce’s website.
The next day I needed a change.
Sirens slipped past another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers on guard to see if they were on guard.
Even if they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Underneath the massive portrait of the fallen newspaper founder, whose middle finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees were following in his footsteps.
"How could one even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaur uses defensive color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like a figure, though quite frightening.
Scientists have unveiled the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that has been so well-preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that its skin covered with scales was reddish-brown in color and that its past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation stunned researchers who described it as "really remarkable."
This scale-covered vegetarian is the best-preserved type of fossil ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to investigate more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, they worked to dig the animal out of a plot of 2,500 pounds (1,100 kilograms).
After all this hard work, the final result is finally ready to be presented to the public.
"If you squeeze a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
While exploring his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, though covered in scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely at considerable risk from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This multi-scarfed dinosaur used red and white to hide from predators, and used a technique called counter-eclipse, which is also used by many animals today.
This allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid enemies, according to experts, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family first made the news in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a lab worker at the Borealopelt Marktmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the creature.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal’s body.
They discovered the counter-eclipse - a method of defense common in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borealope is much larger than the animals living in the eclipse today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred hiding rather than confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most modern animals using counter-eclips – such as deer, zebras or armadillos – are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
"The intense hunting of a huge dinosaur with a huge number of scales shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period could have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the armor also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell in a river when it died, thereby reaching the sea with a stream, where it sank backwards to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to extend much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
“As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – just squeeze your eyes and it feels like she’s sleeping.”
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge carnivorous dinosaurs roamed the Earth on two legs - theropods.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopella, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopella was washed into the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-length spikes came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this squash-covered herbivore roamed through the present-day Western Canada until the flooded river washed up into the high seas.
But the undersea burial site of the dinosaur helped preserve its scales in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still covered by the skulls of the dinosaur along the bulging armoured plates.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “Such a degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more unbelievable it feels.
The fossilized skin remains still cover the bulging skull plates on the animal’s skull.
The right front leg lies beside him and the five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, a resident of St. Louis sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
She got caught up in a post from her former schoolmate.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old, and he's still lying on the street."
She was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on her feed, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The <0x40>TheePharoah user's posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's dead body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but saw a tweet later in the night that reported a gathering of people on Canfield Drive this time.
Photos of police tapes and screaming people were shared, along with a man claiming to be Brown’s father holding a sign saying, “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
He watched a live stream where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another police officer said he was holding a gun and yelling, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how he hit himself with the thought, "It's unusual."
“It’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and we could call typical.”
I felt scared at that moment.
I was angry and I cried.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the two of them would ride to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary Whose Streets?, which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter—who wore a floral dress and had a crown that matched it on their heads—leaved to Ferguson, they again talked about what they had discussed several times before that morning—the experiences and conditions of life of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls, asking himself.
“We’re driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
“What is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
She needs to learn about activism and organization, and at the same time, she needs to know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to educate her without having to experience insolent racism in her own person, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world.”
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a police station across the road that had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news of policeman Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They put together bags of food and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that while she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Nursing Students of Minorities and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It all just went well.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film’s co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening’s demonstration.
Folayan said he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell asked, “Are you trying to document what’s going on or find a story that can be exploited?”
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases where people - often white people - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already slammed hands with co-director Davis, an artist in the region known for activism in relation to sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project captivating for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the crew of Whose Streets for years after Brown was shot.
“In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that’s how I was portrayed.”
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience -- to show that the movement was not a "redeemer's guide, but a community gathering," as Folayan said -- he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets document surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen work.
“But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.”
What’s more, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and re-focuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who created the <0x23>BlackLivesMatter tag on social media in 2012 after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in leading roles have kept the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "it's not a matter of creating a kind of equality of opportunity" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who gave me the right energy," he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that she was standing right on the front line, because there’s a lot at stake living as a black homosexual woman at such nodes.
Its energy can be perceived through the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras from Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police remain fragile.
Ferrell was sentenced to 2.5 years on parole for blocking the road during the protest.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region he calls home, simply as a "stupid boogeyman."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra that he has engraved in his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three whole years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
7 ways to get over a hangover after a weekend party
Some of the strongest male boys will find that after a drink-free party, what the trouble is, will help.
They say, “Avoid hangovers, stay drunk.”
But it's just an inevitable delay and a health bump.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible after today and tomorrow’s weekend party?
Drink some water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids by drinking alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
Minerals are washed out of the body together with water, so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or just slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
You shouldn’t go to your grandmother’s house with a hangover to cut down trees – it could be a fatal mistake.
But a light walk will help your body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Sitting in a tent and sleeping out of a hangover is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body back energy slowly and carefully.
If you’re already sick of vomiting from yesterday’s overdrinking, you should definitely not try to load your stomach with a big fat roast.
Start with fresh juice, for example, which contains fruit sugars that quietly revitalize your body.
If you’re already sick at lunchtime, you might want to try broth.
And a little later, backs up.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from the last bit of water.
As I said before, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in the evening to prevent a hangover, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and it will lose performance.
That way, you'll ruin your liver even more, and the hangovers will be even worse.
In addition, the pain reliever does not stay in the body for long anyway.
If you take painkillers in the morning, don’t do it on an empty stomach – it will irritate your already wrinkled stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It's like walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid excessively active and insane poses - during a hangover, the physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding.
Talk foolishly to your friends and co-workers, do simple nonsense, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not dissipate a hangover, but they are certainly more fun to endure aftereffects.
One day I'll get a hangover anyway!
A Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are wanted for murder.
Police say a Northwestern University professor and a staff member of the University of Oxford have been searched nationwide for suspects after finding the body of a man with fatal stab wounds in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court documents, warrants were issued on Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed repeatedly.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found a victim with multiple puncture wounds on the body upon arriving at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and investigators treat the stabbed as murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an email that Lathem was now temporarily suspended from work and was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the financial department at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an email: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help U.S. investigative agencies in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to turn themselves in.
"The police have a clue where they are, but we're working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from a Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a cryptic clue that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police, it was a spectacular sight.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the event took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of the events and the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute."
Startups that help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were unsuccessful.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to guarantee anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system was simply not consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products to 75 people in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outsiders.
New types of human resource start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hotline of complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and turn to the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, he has gained a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel in the three years he’s been using Glint.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys targeted at specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the causes.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an harassing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have insight is a profitable business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Denver Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed interest and activity growth this year against the backdrop of Uber’s dubious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been seized by regulatory authorities," Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent, said in a statement.
Quinlan said that if it is found that a company is treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation’s headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, Ruby Tuesday’s general advisor James Vitrano said, saying there was no good way to follow up on employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, it is possible to identify and address problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that previously did not reach managers operating in offices in other cities or states more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree employee experience," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it was only when “social media matured” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from being washed publicly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent was funded by <0x24>10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to <0x24>47 million.
In November, Glint invested <0x24>10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total funding to <0x24>60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today’s employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are mere bets on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of general benefit and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn revenue when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they find support.
Ownership of data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in work culture.
However, this data is useless if the company’s supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if changes don’t happen fast enough or not at all, this can lead to disappointment and reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consultancy and business administration company who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if things don’t go to the end, employees will think, ‘Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly surveys of employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem was reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, is gathering new data on employees, and it is hoped that in the long run this will lead to a longer-term employee engagement in an industry known for its high workforce turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.”
The Baltics are the bright star of the eurozone: incomes are growing rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, citing a report from the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, gross economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is driven by low indebtedness, rapidly improving institutions and business- and free-market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita in purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank said in a statement.
Although the aim is to equalize the GDP per capita of the economy with the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 the GDP per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimate that their economies are doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought so about their economies.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice-daily workouts makes Bruins days long
It’s almost 11 p.m. when a group of UCLA football players stops to chat at the edge of the team’s new practice field on campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirt, exposing their sweaty back from the efforts of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these time-lapses offer a midday break.
After three hours of training, players will return to the dorm to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman football center for meetings at 6.30 the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel the twice-daily training sessions to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer – at least until they finish their final exams on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
Switching from two workouts per day means more one workout per day – the start of the Bruins training camp was lifted almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in Mora’s six Westwood seasons, the workouts take place during the summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled until August 20 before official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the tight schedules of players.
"They're going to have a huge load on three or four days, and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
“And they will break through this trial; they will exert themselves, they will be beautiful young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
When the camp is over, UCLA will make the training closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking lot nearby their squares and the adjacent Luskin Center, a superior hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have passed the defense grid around the gatepost.
Beginning this weekend, the Bruins will be occupied by players at the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems could arise with available rooms during the season.
"We will implement security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a workout.
If you have a recording of your training, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we're gonna use security in there and at the 8th parking lot.
We will do our best to use what we have.
I try not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place.”
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral coalition, which was born to the Centre Party for revenge, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave the EKRE to join forces, and the businessmen’s electoral coalition Tegus Tallinn – it seems that at least the same coalition created on the initiative of those who have been burned in party politics will take part in the elections this year.
Chicks, however, will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If the support of Edgar Savisaar has shrunk, the events organised in honour of his electoral coalition can be seen.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current centre-party members and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar’s loyal supporters and friends are avoiding running in Tallinn be searched for by the fact that the “Savisaar List” of the offenders, led by corrupts and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city government for a Russian-language pop song, in which an elder from the Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense a rudimentary computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid squirrels and squirrels on the road when riding a bike - is this the way the Centre Party is trying to get the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters allowed for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other political parties think of a youthful election campaign.
If a viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 has been watching a black square instead of an entertainment show since the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen on the free-to-air platform, or to hand over ten to a TV operator every month.
There are probably also those who, at first, publicly delight in an ad-free TV experience, but at the end of the day - even if reluctantly - pay for TV pictures and advertisements.
Ear-blowing music, noisy crowds and junk left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be a part of the noise yourself, instead of headaches at home, it’s worth exploring your homeland – and leaving your sleeping place for the festival guests for a lot of money.
Washington is changing the green card rules.
The media quotes President Donald Trump, who said a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The Act reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said.
The Siberian Seto young people move into the city, the pensioners return to the countryside.
Yevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous seto miners along the river Maana.
He works as a driver in a gold bar 140 kilometres from his home on the shores of the M<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81> River Kuwai.
This is hard work: 12 hours of work for two consecutive months without holidays and then only 10 days at home and back again.
During his three years at the Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There's a tough order: when you go in, you're thoroughly checked not to bring vodka, and when you go out, you're checked not to bring gold," Anatoly said.
Mare Piho is talking to Jaani, a local seto in the village of Haida, who has told her a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture of the Siberian Setos, which is still preserved, will also affect the home setos, because it is just so fabulous, Piho Mare, who studied the distant setos in the most thorough way, thinks.
His first expedition to Siberia will be 30 years old this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many setus emigrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say 8,000.
I calculated it based on the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at the time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was only given to one, but he had children, sisters, and other female relatives.
Look at the size of the territory here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
We had to educate them, manage them in some way.
The Setos came here like peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (flogging), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petseri, many sets later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in the region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marrying each other and multi-childhood persisted for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How different is the Siberian Seto culture and how different is it from the native Seto culture?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought in a lot of folk costumes.
They made their own (people's) clothes, but they always made a difference between what was brought with them and what was done here.
Climate change has had a strong impact on Seto’s traditional clothing, because it’s colder here.
The food changed.
In Setomaa, for example, the meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages and what kind of life is there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is starting to give back there, is starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haida at the beginning of July on the Day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left is amazing.
"It is very easy to come to Tapa and also to leave, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, an opera artist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural sites, and you can get a seal on every corner.
Kill is a top city!
There is a small island along the Valgejõe river that runs through the city, where slaughterers tend to have a yankee party.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window," says Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, it's all right.
You can have a picnic on the river bank and just make romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life ahead and behind.
I’ve been there with my girlfriends.
Oak has been on the river bank between three bridges practicing its aria: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one might even meet you if you rummage your own stories."
"Männikumägi offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and play disc golf, for example - the golf course has been made, discs can be borrowed from the fitness centre," says Reigo.
The old pros go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't gotten there yet.
You should probably invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
I think he's borrowing me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during skiing lessons.
There are many tears and disappointments left on this mountain and you will win in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is currently full of construction works, all of this will change to the unknown," Reigo said.
Tapa’s old and tired vault building is, however, a very attractive place where summer productions are played.
I’m glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M’s manager Märt Meos accepted my idea and went to the summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" has just ended, on August 11th there will be "Awakening" at the railway station, as the old vault building is moving around in the 1980s.
"From 11th to 13th August, the City of Tapa will have its days, during which open home cafés and a series of cultural events, including a folk rally, will take place," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city during those days.
The museum has been housed in a tiny yellow cottage on the 1st of May boulevard since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information," says Reigo, a place full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military.
Reigo smiles that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, your stomach will soon go empty, but luckily the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sitting in coffee shops sometimes gives you the feeling that you are abroad," she describes.
The educated and young soldiers who came to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
BTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegal campers in the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone caught resting in a place that is not intended for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Wolves that teach puppies go to break sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves "learning material" from their flock again after a year's break - apparently the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, says Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, the year before 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency that no wolf nests were born in Hiiumaa last year and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year are also in sync with the breaks.
On Monday night, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emmaste and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured another one, who had to be killed in distress.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Genetically Modified Organism Release Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the Coordination Circle.
The amendment of the Act abolishes the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and handlers, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop handler to have a prior agreement with the beekeeper within the prescribed radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
This is at least until a decision has been made to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"However, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The Bill repeals the provisions related to the database of GM crop locations and handlers and handling training in GMOVS, establishes requirements for handling GM crops and starting economic activities.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the existing obligation of the GM crop grower to inform beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for co-ordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the information system of the Bills and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect people active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed - the MON 810 maize.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, the European stem pest, to which the MON 810 maize line is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this maize line are bred in the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of summer rape, corn and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of rape, corn and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded from the above that there is no deliberate cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia and it has also been confirmed that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic as "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic after making his debut against midfielder Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A player overbought from Chelsea for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million started at Dublin United in the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday for a 2-1 win in the initial line-up, impressing in a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on assault raids.
However, after missing the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in a badly short match form and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said he needed to fix before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, started at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly started setting up his eleven starting men for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more players, but he confirmed that the club has already done "great work" by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another stork reptile got a GSM transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher living in Sõrve, the first stork son was born in Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and has joined the large overnight stay in Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there are no grain fields in Sõrve, writes the Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late for ringing the cranes, another crane boy got attached to the escort, and this on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork boy named Mati was supplied with a GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türju.
"Everyone can watch his activities on the Internet: how he went to winter in Spain, came back and stalled on the German-Polish border for a long time, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
A British inventor had a microchip inserted into his body to get into a house and a car with a swipe of his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open his front door with a simple gesture of his hand, get into the office and even start the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also replaces locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, charging <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology in both his home and his car, the BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to military documents published by TIME magazine, the White House decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month cost taxpayers <0x24>24,000 in the southern yard for an event commemorating American production.
The green and white colored Sikorsky VH-3D, called the Marine One at the time of the President's boarding, was the central attraction of the event introducing American construction programs to the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials on their tour of industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House's war cabin requested the presence of the helicopter with a partial command, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it's an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email the day before the event to his boss, the deputy chief of the navy officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter will arrive in the southern courtyard on 17 July at around 7:00 p.m. for the event and will remain there until the courtyard is cleaned between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same night.
It was added that if departure from the White House was delayed, a second flight would be required for return flights due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, and the squadron’s security crew remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
From the documents given to TIME magazine, it was not possible to find out whether a second copy was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that the HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told it would not," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the deputy chief officer.
The White House declared the event “made in America” to be an official event, and Hatch’s law would not cover it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of health care reform that were discussed at the event in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photo sessions is unusual.
Trump was spotted in February when a presidential plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was crawling with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of 'American-made' products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
The HMX-1 teams often conduct test flights around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice putting the President of the United States at the White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 test landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight to the event “made in America” was included in the flight training norm for that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit at the event burdened the taxpayer’s wallet.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing the exhibition of the helicopter in the southern courtyard.
The HMX-1 does not retain presidential flight budget documents, and the exact cost of the event is difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense’s 2017 FY1 hourly rate, the compensation rate for the VH-3D is <0x24>24,380 per hour of flight.
The squadron's records indicated the length of the flight was 30 minutes from its base at Navy Quantico Airport in Virginia, both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
'These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations.'
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter during the event.
“The point is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it’s right to highlight it.”
It is unclear whether Trump encountered a helicopter during a tour in the southern courtyard, but he sat behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky’s representatives, making fun of media outlets about the company’s products in his personal fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, <0xC5><0xA0>adeik was hit in the last area, 800 metres of leg cramp, and the stadium girl was taken away on a stretcher.
Just before that, he had reached zero in a distance jump at a university held in China.
The 2012 European Championships in Helsinki were damaged by a spear-throw injury, but at the 2012 London Debut Olympics he was ranked 23rd with 6013 points.
But the luck continued.
At the 2013 Moscow World Championships, after the opening day, an Estonian woman who was on record in Estonia got a thumb injury in a distance jump.
Two years later, he was ranked 15th at the Beijing World Championships and met the Olympic norm, but this was also a disappointment for the athlete who wanted more.
<0xC5><0xA0>adeiko only passed the heaviest league last year, when he did not get a result in the distance jump at the Amsterdam EM.
I just want to put together a good multi-competition once in a while.
"Once," said Shadeiko.
Worse still, a month later, his Olympics in Rio were interrupted by a thigh injury at the first obstacle.
Is it time for the seventh race to continue?
Are two days worth it?
She thought about it for a long time, but found peace.
I've got my head cleared
It’s a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I’ve been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal myself and think clean.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pills in the bag yet," Shadeiko says about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new impetus.
Coach Anne Mägi said that it was very difficult to watch the suffering of a caregiver, but she realized that the athlete must first of all find out about himself.
He was so killed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit, however, said he would not give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth," says Mägi.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in Götzis’s multi-race.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark by nearly a meter (13.89) in a bullet strike and ran an obstacle race close to a record time.
Then the multi-competitioner felt that it was not a cap of ability at all, but only the primary hunger of the competition was erased.
Mägi, who has supervised him for many years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a good athlete, he's good at training.
When something is wrong or wrong, he says it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we have to do.
I cannot tell you exactly what to do, and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
"I'm not the kind of person who maximizes in training," he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The baby’s closeness makes me happy.
Good feelings have also been brought to Shadeiko by the happiness of his loved ones.
Her former training partner Maris Mägi and her sister Grete have recently become parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from new citizens of the world.
"It's been really interesting," says Shadeiko.
Drinking alcohol is equivalent to training the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It’s not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, it’s about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By sniffing glass, swirling wine in our mouths, enjoying it, and sensing the aftertaste, we make our brains work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain flavor, but the flavor arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
It compares how the brain “sees” colors.
"The taste isn't in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Shepherd, of course, warns that wine is not meant to get drunk.
“There has to be more in action,” he says.
If you take too much, the system will be oversaturated.
Drinking too much wine can harm the brain instead of benefit — a 2004 study found that people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental capacity.
10% of Estonian ICT workers receive less pay than their colleagues
According to the data of the personnel search company Fontes, 10% of Estonian ICT workers are paid less than their colleagues.
There is a 10 percent pay gap between men and women, according to Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector salary survey of Fontes.
A total of 8,577 posts were considered.
63% of the jobs were men.
"While only three companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe that there is no pay gap, in reality men's monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than women's and men's total annual salary is on average 8% higher than women's," said Ilmar Põhjala, an analyst at Fontes.
"Narcose" Season 3 Advertising Clip: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali Cartel takes centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of "Narcose", the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already had an advertising clip, which teases the series with new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world’s richest drug-dealing organization – the Cal cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, “like a Fortune 500 company,” simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leads ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a newly released commercial clip, Pedro Pascal sees Javier Penana returning, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to help fight the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos opens on September 1.
Afghan Democracy Depends on the Role of Women in Politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in the elections.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations aid mission, said hundreds of women are running for local councils, three women are running for vice-presidents, and more than 30 percent of recent registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate by emphasising the importance of women's role," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women will enhance the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

From the Philippines to the wide world, or <0xC3><0x95>lgkot’s journey to the hearts of fashion fans
The straw braided bags are a summer classic that has become a hit product in recent years, which has to hang on a hand to a real summer lover, and to which merchants have been able to weld a price tag suitable for the hit, despite its modest origins.
A straw braided bag is probably one of those things that everyone has had once in their life and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn’t, nothing is broken.
But now straw bags are making a real turnaround and fashion fans have exchanged their exquisite designer bags for simple straw braided bags for the summer months.
It’s not just a beach bag, it’s just as popular today as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk to the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth clarifying whether a summer look like this for the boss is still sitting or it is still worth pushing the wetsuit and laptop to a more formal sumadan.
The variety of straw bags, however, has made women’s true summer love.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that comes to mind is that fashion lovers rush to the local market first thing on their holiday trip and buy themselves some straw bags, which they will be faithful to during their holidays and which will accompany them to the beach, the market and also hanging around the city with their girlfriends.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags on the market and sell them or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to attack each other in order to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this kind of madness is also understandable, because it is rare that in the fashion world it is possible to buy something that has become a hit for only a few dozen euros.
True, cunning merchants have also discovered an easy way to make money here, and so fine luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and -thousand euros.
Probably so that the richer customers don't have to feel like mere mortals who are walking around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag that costs over a thousand euros.
However, Chanel’s straw bag interpretation can cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,000.
However, unlike most fashion designers, the straw bags do not come from a few great fashion designers, but their story begins much further away.
The straw bags are said to have come from far away from the Philippines, from where they have spread widely.
Braiding a bag of straw is mainly an export business there, and you don’t see the locals walking around with them very often.
The straw weaving technique supposedly dates from the 14th century and is quite similar to the usual basket weaving.
However, since the straw bag does not need to be braided as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into it, which makes the bag more personal and therefore more attractive.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with woven colored ribbons or leather strips.
The straw bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest straw bag fan ever seen before.
In fact, he matched the straw bag with all kinds of clothing sets and didn’t even consider it a big deal to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags today does not play a lesser role, but it is also the fact that taking care of them is a rooster head, and unlike all other kinds of Sumadans, they do not need to be taken care of by special means, but water and a wet towel also do the job.
As always with trendy outbursts, besides the classic look, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a straw braided sleeve or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag will never go out of fashion, but on the straw bag it will.
What is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries it has been considered a classic straw braided bag that resembles a basket in its style, is open on top and has short handles, as well as straw.

GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union awaits confirmation from the managers of McVitie’s about long-term production plans at the company’s Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross object.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie’s, Pladis, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the object in the last few years.
Workers were hired there, and trade union leaders "are the first to hear" if anything changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's to "resolve concerns that the funding will not be used to modernize production lines".
Drew Duffy, GMB’s senior organizer, said: “The fact that we are not getting clarity from the object’s chief executive about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying for our members.
Several generations of families have been employed here, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people around Glasgow, an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, Glasgow in the east urgently needs a firm with a thriving growth in productivity at McVitie."
A spokesman for Pladis said: “The head of the Tollcross object received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and representatives of GMB took place in Tollcross, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and sites - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and operational improvements.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if any changes should occur in the operation of the site, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by making a <0xC2><0xA3>189 million offer to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking conquest?
This buzzing approach has opened a summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the current world record for more than double over-purchase set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete, who will be paid <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week by PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry with both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the world of football about this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi strongly warned all clubs that were thinking about hiring some of the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll face them and contact them," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be hit back by this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
“Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to set a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he said.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and because it cannot, to remain a part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain’s exit smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Remarking that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, "We could certainly have such an agreement with Britain."
An alternative would be to return to customs, which would proclaim historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit a “challenge for our generation” and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s everyday life.
During a visit to Belfast, the Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
With his first half-long triathlon, Märt Avanti: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in Otepää, the winter capital, when the half-long Ironman competition attracted about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi won his first triathlon.
"I thought it was going to be difficult and in the end it was difficult," Avandi said in the finish line.
Despite its complexity, Avandi admitted that in fact, triathlon is a feasible head for everyone.
"Not distance kills, but pace kills," he said, implying that at an achievable pace, almost everyone reaches the finish line.
With the exception of Ott Sepp: "Ott's physical is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
He had been training since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
At 5:34:12, he reached the 270th place in the overall ranking.
Although Avanti lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he defeated other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar lost to Avanti in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the Otepää men’s stage was the German Johannes Moldan with 3:58:27, the best Estonian Ivo Suur with 04:14:09.
Among women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won 04:24:01, while the Estonians won Maria Jänes, who lost to Frederiksen in about half an hour and got to 04:58:58.
The 1.9 km swimming distance was completed in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at position 410.
