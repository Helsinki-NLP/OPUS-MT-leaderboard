Dealer.
I live in the past.
Few people were here today.
It was hot and the weather was humid.
I hope what you're saying is true.
We knew Tom was telling the truth.
I'm close by.
I won't let you go.
I hope what you're saying is true.
Tom loves shopping at Kaufland.
He's the one I've always dreamed of.
Is that fly in the picture or is it photographed there?
Not with the woman, not with the man.
I heard a familiar voice.
What can I get you today?
Her hair is red.
Then give me two more.
I wasn't talking to you.
You need to get a girlfriend.
How do you know so much about me?
Is there an easier way to do this?

I'd know if I wanted to, but I don't want to.
What did you have for dinner?
A Swiss and a Somali are created equal, living only in Switzerland, Somalia.
What part are you in?
I'll be back soon if I have to.
Sit back and listen to me.
“Are you sure?”
This was not part of the original plan.
Who allowed you to sit at my computer?
“Hurry, bring me the newspaper!” “How long have you been my boss?”
I live with my dad.
Give me a piece of paper and a pen.
I have to get up early this week.
Can you help me?
We sat on the fence.
It's simpler than it used to be.
Call your father and ask him.
The neighbor's chickens are better than mine.
He opened the tap and the water began to flow.
The Tuaregs have great respect for camels.
You're a worthless husband!
Work didn't stop for a minute.
From now on, be quiet.
I have to admit, I read the epilogue before the rest of the book.
You see, huh?
I have a strong faith.
We'll wait till tonight.
I don't need him anymore.
Slipped in the bathroom.
My mother's mother is my grandmother.
I couldn't answer a single question on the test.
The truth is harder to believe.
It's in a box.

His head is disproportionately large.
It's a guard dog.
He'll do whatever I want.
Tom is not a team player.
Anyone have a question?
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
I can't really take a stand on this.
He wanted to be alone.
He loved me like no one's ever loved me.
Tom did this, not that.
I liked the way you talked to him.
I saw a bear driving a truck.
They're gonna be mad at me.
Give me that candle.
They barely went to the meeting.

Uncle agreed.
They said it was urgent.
Here is another example.

We're not in the mood right now.
I don't even dare ask how the sauce got on the ceiling.

Who's waiting for us?
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
At least two people died.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I'm sorry.
I know exactly what you're up to.
Tom found the alcohol I hid.
Let him do what he wants.
I'm heading that way.
Where did you get this lovely bouquet of flowers?
It was hard for Tom to explain what happened.
I understand what you're saying, but I don't know what you're talking about.
“Are you sure that’s true?” — Yes. I saw a documentary about it on YouTube.

We started working early.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
It's hard to believe.
It has two sides.

Believe it or not, he can't even bake eggs.
You found?
Tom always says yes.
The neighbor's chickens are better than mine.
Do you have a gun license?
But this list is empty!
He doesn't have much time left.
Is the microphone on?

Both solutions are correct.
Tom went to the exit.
I can't do the clock.
Which way did you go?

It'll be ready when it's needed.
He's a monster.

I don't want to see him.
Don't try to wake me up again.

Tom is an Egyptian.
He's one of my associates.
There is not enough room for everyone.
That doesn't surprise me at all.
It's a dictionary.
Do you consider yourself a happy person?
I'm not gonna stand up for it.
Time is a mystery.
Tom did this, and he didn't.
It's a bad habit.
