The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide to hold the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111 000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, on his first major foreign visit since May’s election victory.
Modi’s five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economy.
At the top of the discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev government of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to engage in an essential political dialogue with the eastern part of the country, Putin said, according to Itar-Tassi news agency.
He also said pro-Russian separatists, who are said to be aided by the Russian army in Kiev and in the West, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current locations where Putin said Ukrainian troops were shooting civilians.
The militia fighters’ goal is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they don’t get the chance to shoot people in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
I was surprised that the group arrived early in the evening.
There were visitors in the two days as expected, promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re still going to be a hip-hop festival, meaning there’s no pop, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday restricting the purchase of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to seek permission from the Police Administration to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as precursors for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, as well as mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but the concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of rape in two hotels is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the High Court of Glasgow.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman “when she is unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make her own decision.”
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands, Nairn, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place in Edinburgh on 17 November in the High Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shines - Mario is overshadowed - Premier League - Evening-Sanomat
It was only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling who once again showed why he is considered the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli’s stronger Liverpool arrived to Tottenham.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude from that of Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
The pool fans who have already chosen the player as a favourite expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers put Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a team star, Balotelli was replaced by Raheem Sterling, a midfielder who scored a 3-0 victory over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine.
An Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than a Balotelli is between the opponent’s lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who runs on the lawn at a speed of about 34 km/h at best.
Rodgers also deserves a lot of praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northerner told how Liverpool has systematically evolved from a Northwest Londoner who grew up at the foot of Wembley into a more complete player than just a midfielder.
Susanna Mälkki elected Helsinki City Orchestra’s Chief Conductor – “I am happy and proud”
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times asked him which orchestra he would take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will begin her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in the musical life of our country for more than a hundred years, for example by performing a large number of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with several members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he says.
Administrations of employee organisations meet in pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus for pension negotiations is sought today from the social partners’ own meetings.
In the morning, the administrations of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiating situation.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Labour market organisations have been swayed, among other things, by the controversy about linking the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be created during this week.

Women Volleyball team Woman Volley from Rovaniemi stumbled on the Vampula Athletes in the final of the training tournament in Pihtiputa on Sunday.
Vampula turned five in a long game to win 3-2.
WoVo lost 15-11 in the final round.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defensive game and in the passport game Vampula was a bit better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo’s sixty-five was squeamish in that the 190-centimeter American center Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played as a senter.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play despite her thumb injury, and she and Johanna Pekkarinen formed WoVo’s most powerful combination.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vamp was a skilled Russian passer-by and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparations for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "store" at 6 p.m. in the official practice game.
We will meet again at the sports school on Sunday.
Lidl forging wild numbers in Finland
During the fiscal year ended at the end of February, the net sales of the company's stores in Finland grew by nearly 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer dies more often in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video in honor of their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women living in urban areas.
Researchers looked at the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers looked at women’s health history over a period of seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses, and socioeconomic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and when the cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the chances of survival were the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not attempt to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan sees delays in diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While distance treatments are becoming more common and less important, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients treated far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s research, women with ovarian cancer have a poor long-term survival rate regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old woman from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its sled parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the city plan proposal for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be made publicly available at a service point in Osviitta.
The Environmental Board and the Lapland Ely Centre will be consulted on the plan proposal.
With the change in the position plan, the city wants to enable the continuation of tourism-related snowmobile activities in the area.
The plan is to create a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
From 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be available permanently.
You can also place refueling points in a specific area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobiling during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and a change in the schedule have also raised loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring blocks of flats have been both worried about the noise and about emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been studied and the surveys have not revealed any observations exceeding the guide values.
Renewed vehicles are also lower-emissions than the old ones.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point were to be moved further, the hotel’s safari guests would have to be transported to the departure points of the safari by buses, which would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and its surroundings are also large enough for sleds, better than places presented as replacement starting points, such as the eastern side of the bridges of the Ounasjoki river.
The location of the Friendship Park is also good because in the future the activities can expand to the Ounaspaviljonki area, for example.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by reserving sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s partial master plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
Decrease in owner-occupied dwellings seen in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially those under the age of 35, could lead to a tens of millions in garden store revenues, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales for their age, the Financial Times reported on a study by the UK's Horticultural Trades Association (HTA).
According to a report by the Financial Times, tenants spend only 55 percent of the money that homeowners spend on gardening.
The study had also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. Also, these factors threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be worth about <0xC2><0xA3> 5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest spending per household on horticultural products in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in housing rentals or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS chief gardener Guy Barter says that “for example, plants grown in mobile pots are particularly popular among tenants because such pots can be taken with them when moving.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997–2005 were a booming period for garden retailing, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, worse than last year’s weather in March and April.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called on the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on a report on espionage by Americans and British forces in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the report was discussed by the U.S. Embassy and Turkish authorities on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main target of espionage by U.S. and British intelligence services.
Turkish news agencies said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major countries had spied on each other.
A previous report of espionage by Germany’s main intelligence service in Ankara sparked a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several success films, has been cast in a new Finnish film.
Croze will star in director Mikko Kuparinen’s film 2 nights until the morning, the filming of which will begin this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2003 film The Barbarian Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg’s film Munich and Julian Schnabel’s film Butterfly on the Glass Dome.
Two Nights in the Morning is starring Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorca's Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> city government in the office of the Attorney General of Mallorca on Friday.
The head of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police on Mallorca's holiday island has been arrested on charges of corruption by business and bar owners in the region of Magaluf, known for its wet partying.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was imprisoned after several business owners of Punta Ballena Street, which houses most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs, filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> city government officials in the office of the Majorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were furious about the bias of the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one business owner told the court.
You're not destroying our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was featured in newspaper headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video appeared online in which an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to curb the intoxicated and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the attendance of the infamous, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to close for a year, and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 was imposed on the nightclub owner and pub crawl organizer, Carnage.
Especially popular among young British tourists, the tourist resort of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as their communities were bombed by rockets and mortars during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
At the Pashosh kindergarten in Ashdod, in the south, workers removed fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit the kindergarten.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, says returning to school after a long time feels “a little strange.”
"We've had some difficult times when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire last week, thousands of people from border communities like Saadi had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas to escape the fire of rockets and grenades from Gaza.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are skeptical about the return of a Palestinian grenade after the killing of a four-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than 10 families have not yet returned.
For the time being, the children of these families have been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that “the children’s education and safety will be taken care of.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately stopped the fighting, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian embargo and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt expects a new round of indirect negotiations to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, saying that at least half of the deaths were soldiers, although it has not had conclusive evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by the Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelters in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, school officials postponed the start of the school the previous week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and that we will be able to get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old sheltered at a school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen the most in seven years during the Australian winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Housing Price Index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1% in August, according to RP data on Monday.
As a result of the increase, prices rose by a total of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not steadily risen across the country.
Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rises.
RP Data’s results show that house prices rose by 16.1 percent in Sydney and 11.7 percent in Melbourne the year before.
Adelaide’s, Brisbane’s and Darwin’s housing markets are the next busiest; the average price rise is between five and six percent.
The housing market is the weakest in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the start of spring in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in sales of the homes to be auctioned, the generally lively sales rate and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual art have attracted record-breaking audiences this summer to Mänttä.
By the end of August, the Serlachius Art Museum has attracted more than 70,000 visitors.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has exhibited classic pop art works by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mänttä Art Week on Monday said that it had made a visitor record when 14,500 people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
These numbers are not used to.
People have been sweeping through doors and windows,” says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums will approach 100,000 this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, we hope that the art season will continue well over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday evening, a window broke into a commercial property in Pohjolankatu.
The suspect had received a small sum of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from a truck tank on Syväojankatu.
A boat with outboard engines had been taken from Petäisenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside was the inscription "OIVA" on the front.
A couple of suspects were caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into.
A police dog got a print and a 20-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, police arrested another man in Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine charged with murder in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of less than 10 grams of amphetamine led to a murder charge against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man went into the apartment with his partner and another man and shot a 34-year-old Kajaani woman with a shotgun who he suspects is a drug-exporter.
The defendant denied the charges and claimed the other man with him to be the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car in which an entourage was burning clothes used for blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The District Court of Kainuu will issue a judgment later on.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, one warm August repeats itself on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a family of seven immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley, Midlands, UK, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently rehearsing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap in upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother’s death, and she is thinking a lot about her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, “Stop the noise.”
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father, discussing things like the shape of beer doctrine or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelting plant in Dudley, giving him an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, even though the working conditions are now better than they were at the time.
The smelters are now a little brighter, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and soot swirl, reminiscent of hell.
Dad used to go to the bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed away the grime from the smelting plant.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that she had been working for years to get us some food on the table, and I began to appreciate her more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood lacked parental intimacy.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn’t until my mother got sick a little before she died that we started telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to her mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and bored.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry’s well-known, short beard perhaps describes his change during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about her role as Othello, she is immersed in making theatre.
Next up were the Comedy of the Mistakes and Fences by August Wilson (“Fences”).
Making a theater offers a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ spotted him doing imitations on stage and contacted the New Faces talent contest.
Henry’s television career began in the mid-1970s. “For quite some time I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV,” he says.
Henry learned while he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to make jokes from the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living a starry life and was on television, and it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where the characters appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment show" was at the same time "a disgusting parody of black people."
In the 1980s, Henry worked on a second comedy series that both made fun of and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
After spending the next decade in commercials, documentaries, TV series, and movie parts, Henry said to himself, “What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you’re just pedaling in your place or walking on sidetracks.”
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme made me afraid.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: “Try.
Don’t abandon the whole idea until you know what you’re talking about.
Meet words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It was almost as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“This is what it’s all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verses, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was ultimately a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it did not quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the comedy of Errors.
Suddenly, I was in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A small voice in my mind told me, ‘You have to do it alone for 10 minutes until the computer is working again.’”
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the scene, and part of me sighed with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the shift words for the play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
Henry, of course, says this in a strange voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little boys of humor constantly interrupt our conversations as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, because getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you are constantly thirsty for it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo theatre when I feel like it, but in general it no longer excites me in the same way as before.
I'm going to ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like to act...
It's really funny.
I’m constantly telling a story, and that’s what I enjoy doing.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya sets up a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to create a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payroll.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left their official post.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
Earlier this year, an audit found that “ghost workers’ salaries and other financial irregularities cost at least <0x24>1 million a month.”
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left office, according to the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri report from the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials will have to register themselves in the next few weeks at the identification centers to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who fails to do so for no good reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, because it will determine how many people actually work in their positions. It will also clean up payroll at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of "ghost workers", says Anne Waiguru, an official in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
Seinäjoki’s result for the financial year 2015 may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit if the city does not adjust its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is expected to be around 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to compromise the scope and level of services, purchases of services, sales of property and subsidies, and increase tax and payment revenues.
The target of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in investments is 8.5 million.
There will be no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in central government contributions will further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways of rebalancing the economy.
The City Council agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned towards a goal in line with the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals to the management team for preparation.
The City Board’s proposals will form the basis for budget preparation at the council’s financial seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds to the City Board and City Council through a panel discussion.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of plotting against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among the detainees.
Some of the police officers were involved in corruption investigations last December against government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large-scale crime squad and tracking phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said police action was part of a planned action against him and others in power by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told awaiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a senior teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will return here at last and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
Celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally children’s embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry of Texas says tweeting was illegal
On Sunday night, Texas Governor Rick Perry’s confirmed Twitter account posted a defamatory picture of a Democratic district attorney in the middle of this hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I have deleted it," a later publication said.
Mr Perry's backing forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet featured a defamatory cartoon about Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding for the post when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry being indicted as a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The headline of the tweet read: "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much promille... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't run a grand jury investigation into Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His influential team of attorneys-at-law has asked the judge to dismiss the charges and said that the law under which the longest-serving governor of Texas is charged is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut <0x24>7.5 million in government subsidies to a public inviolability unit in Travis County that handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Mr Perry's decision prompted a left-wing observatory to make a formal complaint.
After Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election conference during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry vowed to end the tie by posting on Twitter a photo of himself jogging on a lake with the words "Here I Come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is “normal” again
One of London’s major builders has warned that the housing market in southeastern England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
The capital city of London has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price rises, while fears of a widespread credit bubble have led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, said Monday that “since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market and the volume of transactions have returned to normal since the peak of 2013,” adding that this has enabled a “stable operating environment.”
London’s housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, well above the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Average sales prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student buildings rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London’s properties a less attractive destination in recent months – some interest has also been affected by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible “cart tax” ahead of the May general election.
London-based real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported tighter lending regulations, would lead to lower market growth in terms of both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s latest data on Monday showed that the number of eligible loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate broker Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 London property price forecast, saying that prices will fall by 3%, as the price index for homeowners’ opinion of prices has already started to decline.
The number of transactions in London’s most expensive areas, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter year-on-year, real estate agent WA Ellis said.
The demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased revenue from sold real estate to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, right product in the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained high."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, amounting to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and revenue increased by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s earnings for the year meet current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the full-year pre-tax profit is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon for <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have images of 100 other stars leaked nude images of Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A spokesman for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photos were authentic and condemned the hacker for “insolent privacy violations.”
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The photos originally published on the 4chan photo release page were apparently in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other hacked stars is said to include dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how many of the images are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead denounced the hacking on Twitter.
"For those of you who are looking at pictures of me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you're in a good mood," Winstead tweeted.
However, in Nickolodeon’s “iCarly” and “Victorious” series, Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that “these so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, don’t you understand?”
Let me put an end to this right in the beginning.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the photos of the star.
We're the only ones with an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's lauded novel about love and the letter J.
They dissolved, it portrayed the best of what had happened, gradually they separated from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, cumbersome, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little spiky.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was spiky, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had at the beginning had been a relationship, which had been promising, however; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonesome boredom, and it might have even brought some substance to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately tender beauty with a cheerful heart, from a northern village that was even more rugged and far from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, who Kevern supposed to be his aunt, who had inherited a house in a damp but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
Pipes leaked, all bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, weeds growing in the garden resembling giant heads of cabbage.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Written by: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Nominations will be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken patio chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and reassuring news, when the crucifixed, sun-tanned legs of Ailinn brought to her mind a song that had been sung long ago by her long-forgotten black man.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren’t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word forget.
Public opinion produced what had not been achieved by laws and decreed proclamation: just as in literature people chose memoirs, cookbooks and romances of heroes to read, in music they preferred ballads.
As the day went by, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing the serenade to Ailinni’s big feet in a bold, comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "J" escaped his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let go of a word that starts with a "j" and didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game then, and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected of him, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn’t banned, it just wasn’t played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Cleverness was the same.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of the music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least she didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, it was likely that she did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude —thankful that they had been spared by the trade of happiness— the principle that each group did things that were inherent in it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean ancestry are best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Continent of India, they were like naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that each family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those who remained in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When THE WHEN IT HAPPENED, those from the Persian Gulf and Middle East whose grandparents had not fled quickly, fearing that they would be accused of burning flames and fearing that the flames would reach them next, opened up restaurants that served labneh-poly-yogurt-life.
Everyone should act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard the ballads, and it was difficult for her to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever be dressed up in music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the big-footed ones.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of the giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
“That was funny,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of view.
There is nothing to see in the whole world but Ailinni’s huge, crow-black hairbrush.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," he said, but did not sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I think you're attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm perverted in that sense.
This hasn't worked.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when she wanted to have fun, the effect was completely different because she, like her father, lacked the persuasive charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of his soft eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her patio chair, and at the same time knocked down the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made only of elderberries, so he could not use it as the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what pervertedly attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both for her own words of unnecessary cruelty and for the fear she felt the moment Ailinn decided to confront her.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been the same as life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though paler and more diabolical than their smuggler and disperser grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, too, because the sucking itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself out of the chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but Kevern’s depth of sorrow surprised her.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him – just as her travel companion watched Kevern go through the window upstairs – to a man who himself was the cause of his heavy life.
Adam was leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands to attack him.
The man who turned his back, bent, shameful, beaten, who had lost all will to fight—why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he could not remember that he had never seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the just described event, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Private Institute for General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a brief study on the persistence of minor and moderate violence in areas of the country where a reduction or even an end to violence was most likely, given the money and energy spent to eradicate it.
"Many has already been achieved, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to counteract the inherent aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years, and have won most of the time, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the towers over the hedges, human kindness has seldom been known in the course of time.
However, some things cannot be eliminated completely.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it produces.
The people weep with sentimental ballads, devour stories of defeated adversity and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban communities in its steadfast grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more malevolent quarrel in our homes, even in the streets.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Mr Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Again, silence.
"I do not ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the Church—and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call innate energy and physical strength.
Saying WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it did happen at all, will destroy the earth’s fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, a flamingo pink LED light proclaimed a directive that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for the previous quarter of the century or longer.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and a sung word is better than a written word, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure her instructor had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, though, we will not pour out our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "describing as 'errors' the actions that our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their ‘hatred and distrust of others’.”
A person in your position should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about ‘us’ or ‘them’.
There was no ‘us’ or ‘others’.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group in society can say that they behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, good or bad.
It was then.
We don’t need to talk about that anymore – we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, so there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what is the past for, if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said and expressed that Esmen was about to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as "evil-souled and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's military denies planning attack; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied having framed a government strike and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighboring South Africa after he said he had received a death threat.
A military spokesman, Major Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the military responded to a threat from "political fanatics". The police are said to have attempted to arm fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after receiving a series of intelligence reports that police forces were attempting to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military’s actions looked like a revolutionary effort.
"While no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to correspond in every way to the characteristics of the revolutionary effort," he said.
Military officials in Lesotho said soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have emerged in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements in the government of the large coalition.
He denies that he has underestimated the power of the government, despite allegations to the contrary.
Microsoft to set up data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, a location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement to Microsoft, the company said it would not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
This is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In the public eye, the location of the centre had previously been guessed at Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will shut down its Oulu office altogether, which will take away about 500 people’s jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft’s Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company will not comment on how much staff the new data center will employ.
The establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa was announced by Kauppalehti on Monday.
Man accused of assaulting a girl at traffic lights
A 78-year-old man is accused of hitting a three-year-old girl at a traffic light in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of hitting a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors said Stewart was driving an Audi Q3 and injured her.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or video underwater, you have a variety of devices to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around <0x24>300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than <0x24>350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are waterproof.
In addition, set the camera's shooting settings to match the photos or video you're taking.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize underwater shooting conditions.
Also – before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can withstand only 5 feet deep, others can withstand up to 50-60 feet deep.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple photos – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and the image composition can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forking, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly in depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colours in your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colours you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important piece of advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater, because the light conditions are scarce.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning that the camera needs to be close to the subject in order for the subject to fill the entire frame of the image.
China won’t let Hong Kong choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament ruled that Hong Kong’s voters must not elect candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong Business District as activists begin planning and implementing the demonstrations only hours after the decision is published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to expel all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," said Democratic Party chairman Emily Lau, a lawmaker.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, the deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that a general candidacy to elect Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom surrendered Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the region that it would be allowed to choose its leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through a nomination committee administered from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was issued, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
At the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would enter a new era of civil disobedience and would cause waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement “considers the Occupy Central Rapture as a last resort that will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and no other way.”
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the takeover of the centre is about to take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
The unrest in Hong Kong is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of people from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s vital condition —business.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will last,” said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip to spread.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
Chinese state media has also reported that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the pawns of the Western powers that are fuelling the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights with 780,000 people taking part – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
U.S. prom tradition hits British universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury mode of travel for today’s students.
In addition to a private jet, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart said there was also a security issue.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today’s students the easiest and highest-quality transportation to the university.
The company’s representative said there have not yet been reservations because the service has just been set up, but added that “students will start placing orders in the next few weeks.”
The company believes there is demand for the service, even though most students pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 in tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of their expectations and wishes. It’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s higher education department, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the majority of students.”
Many who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and scholarships is lagging behind the enormous rise in basic living costs.

Eight dead in Paris apartment explosion
The death toll rose to eight on Monday following an explosion in a Paris suburb.
The accident in Rosny-sous-Bois on Sunday left 11 people injured, four of them seriously.
Rescue workers are still searching for the survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but the hope of finding the survivors faded.
The initial cause of the explosion is suspected gas leakage.
The explosion occurred early on Sunday and was so intense that it shook buildings within a radius of more than 100 metres.
Our whole house was moving; we were trembling with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing," said Maryline Yyvon, who lives next door to the crash site.
On Sunday, an emergency shelter was set up for the residents of the nearby school.

Bulgarian Prison Staff Holds National Protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the Ministry of Justice of the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted the old working rules, which were recently amended, back.
Salary increases are also to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour system.
Despite a meeting between representatives of the Prison Workers' Association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached on the matter, according to Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are underway, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director General of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
Prison Workers’ Association members are expected to join in the protest.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had fainted on the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget his black-and-white U.S. game and beat Ukraine in the second half with his stalled solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in the style of:
I was about to pass out at the end of the pitch, that encouragement was so great.
His eyes were blurred, and there was nothing he could do.
The noise and the white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin’s moments of power kept nine surfaces in a fast pace, with ball grabs, discs and tumbles everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow state that it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere, now in an incredibly important place, Sasu glowed.
That's my part.
Doing all that.
It was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the joy pill and spirit creator of the team, so it’s no wonder that his example took the whole team on the fly, which was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of pause: the previous one reminded me of an outrageous referee game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It’s been 32 years since the Finnish men’s national volleyball team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first quarter.
"In the decision balls of that match, the referee's game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already taken the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that the bastards went even more crazy," Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world champions as the Polish World Cup kicks off on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The power values of the players are roughly the same as before, but there is more quality and skill now.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever," Parkkali thought.
What will happen in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to seeing Finland move on from the beginning.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a win-win match against Tunisia.
The current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a global player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we get to the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," Parkkali said.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the Argentine national team.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö played in Tunisia.
The sauna and the evening service at the Church of the Sailors of Buenos Aires were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Championships.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from Norway’s mountain: “These men deserve all the thanks”
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
This weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog who was with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract it and pull it a bit forward, but its feet just didn't carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, the police, the nearby hotel and passers-by did not call for help.
By the end of the day, the situation was beginning to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers were there who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway, Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen, and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the hillside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog,” Antti Soini told Ilta-Sanomi in a message.
Soon a German man came along with a mat for a trip.
The mattress gave Cita something like a stretcher, and the injured dog was attached to it.
A German man came after us for a while after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while,” Soini says.
Photo: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of a hiking mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once again.
The sonnets answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and honor, and I will forever be grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - I heard Cita was feeling better already!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth had only a few years to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which means a set of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms of motor activity such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and toe tightness.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain and is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a very low survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before turning 18 and would die before reaching 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me more time than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent a series of surgery to straighten his legs, and after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his examination papers, which said that he was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she said.
When I heard from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18, and I would die before I was 25, and in the meantime, I would gradually lose all my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his walking had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was deferred,” she says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The passengers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” said Ivo Koteski, spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Police said the migrants had paid about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 each to get to Greece, and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, with a population of a couple of million, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

In contrast, the sales of everyday goods have increased by almost one per cent.
Joan Rivers’s family ‘hopes for the best’
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was taken to a New York City hospital, but her daughter today was hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers wrote today.
We hope for the best.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto 3 reactor to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided TVO Teollisuuden Voima with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3.
According to Areva’s press release, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor’s automation systems.
The project is already years overdue.
In May, TVO did not give any estimate of the completion date of reactor three.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of land to Bottas - value approximately EUR 60,000
The municipal board of Nastola donated to Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas a 1.4-hectare beach plot on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi in Villoinen.
The municipal government showed a fair spirit of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
No gravel sounds were heard at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
Bottas gift plot has seven farm buildings - a total of seven.
They will be dismantled by the municipality this year, with one exception.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the plot within two years.
We are delighted that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
Hopefully it will continue, the mayor said.
The Mayor estimates the monetary value of the beach plot to be EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
With varying success over the decades, Nastola has managed to keep successful sportsmen in the municipality with the help of gift plots.
Aki Parviainen, the world champion of spear throwing, and Tuuli Matinsalo, the world champion of aerobics, got their lands from the municipality and built magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their properties and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola in search of work and then moved when the life situation changed elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nasto and his situation is different, Syrakki inches and believes Bottas will stay in his hometown.
Hull scored a record for the Hernandez club
The Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguay's national team member Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez switches to Hull for <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million).
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and reached the Italian league.
For the Uruguayan national team, he scored seven goals in 14 games.
In the World Cup final last summer, Hernandez came to the pitch in two games.
"Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," Hull head coach Steve Bruce said.
On Monday, Hull announced that he had also acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russia's space test fails: Geckos sent to sex mission dead
The five little geckos sent by Russia to reproduce in space are dead, the Russian space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Geckos travelled on the Photon-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning at Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
The effects on geckos can be used to predict the effects that weightlessness would have on humans if they were in a state similar to that of prolonged periods of time, the New Statesman said in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the cause or causes of death of geckos are determined.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers who were labeled “sex geeks” were frozen.
Surprisingly, the fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 also survived the trip with difficulty and also had offspring.
France Arrests Terrorist Suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities found the man after he lured a 16-year-old girl into Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
He is said to be from Chechnya, but now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man’s actions before.
The French authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people lured into the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France.
Authorities estimate that around 800 French nationals or those enrolled in France have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
A: We have a good chance of winning.
The national basketball team’s hopes for a future place are in play as Finland today faces Ukraine in its second World Cup match.
If the opening loss for the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
“Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning,” Koponen predicted.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic in its first match of 72-62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday’s defeat for the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal pack of wolves on the field, Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged nude faces are spreading online - some confirmed to be authentic
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that are allegedly depicting famous celebrities.
Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a “naked” campaign.
The entertainment site TMZ has released an angry comment from Lawrence’s representatives that appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence’s stolen photos will be prosecuted.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that her images are genuine.
She took these photos years ago with her husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrifying effort was made to do this.
I sympathize with everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes.
Victoria Justice, on the other hand, claims that the pictures in her own name are fake.
At least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer are also on the move.
Honka's goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalie Walter Viitala’s comments after Sunday’s VPS match describe the club’s mixed current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a 1-2-loss fight.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the bad defensive game.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With player roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala smothered without naming any single player.
Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
“After the game, I told certain players that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you’re a betting league player and you don’t have to work, then you’re probably on the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that no immediate success can be expected from players as their peers are constantly changing.
There has not been the same team twice in a row.
Particularly in the defense, the group has changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after a VPS loss, with TPS being the second-finalist in the tie points.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espoors still have time to avoid falling to the 1st.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop one now.
We’re not going to fall out of this series,” the goalkeeper said.
Lars von Trier is making a TV series after decades of pause.
Director Lars von Trier is returning to the series.
The Danish director is working on a television series called The House That Jack Built.
Trier film producer Louise Vesth announced the project at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to production company Zentropa, the filming of the series is expected to begin in 2016.
Trier is said to be engaged in the series’ script work starting this autumn.
The series is in English.
The company’s long-time partner, Peter Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen, is known for his hard sales pitches.
He said the series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Hold your breath," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in a statement.
In recent years, Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
For television, he directed the Kingdom series in the 1990s.

the Ice Bucket Challenge with a dislocated chin
British Isabelle Roberts was screaming so loud when ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge ended painfully badly.
She has been taken to treatment after screaming for the Ice Bucket challenge so loud that her jawbone was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts was screaming so loud when ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just yelled, but as I yelled, I felt my chin start to stiffen," he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British man who took part in the super popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where his chin was reinstated.
The video has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Viewpoint on howling wolves (also): How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great day.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championships against France at the Maroussi Ball Hall in Athens.
Pehkonen didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
The same was true of the about 100 Finns who shouted loud noises in the otherwise empty hall, which attracted 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian match of the World Cup?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times the number of Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships were the season of Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying game at Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Mötölä to the final team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
It can now be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
At the Games in Athens, a total of just over 100 Finns were present.
It included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
This phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don’t think anyone can tell you the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever number there is, it is an incomprehensible number.
This is for sports sociologists to explain.
In the global economy, businesses are moving across borders.
We still have the opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go and see how our girls and boys are successful in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Physical Sociology.
Surely there are Finns in both Spain and the Volleyball World Cup in Poland who are looking for an experience.
A common experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
There must be attraction in the sport itself.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports than to go to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let’s go back to 1995.
That’s when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and the players to enter top-level sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team action was raised to a pedestal.
The Volleyball crew did the same thing a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have succeeded in productizing their top sports, where the Holy Trinity operates: sports-media sponsors.
Then the public will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what this kind of carnivalist support is, Itkonen recalls.
Can ball sports transfer this massive interest to home games as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played on average for hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good for the species.
The other school believes that interest shifts.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a sweet full stomach.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Championships, but in their basic thinking, the domestic leagues are of little interest to me.
It's a challenge for the companions in the middle of the drug.
Confirmation of Bottas plot - almost 1.5 hectares from the shore of the lake
Nastola will reward Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach home plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be built.
Nastola has been following Bottas’ success since his karting season.
He is considered a good ambassador for marketing Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, by the lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in dismantling, of which the municipality will dismantle six by the end of this year.
Bottas reached his fourth prize pool in the Formula 1 in Belgium this year.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nasto and lived in Villähde during his childhood.
He currently lives in England, but visits Nastola whenever there is no formality.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design Smart Clothes Come - But Hardly for the Poor
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are tested by the ball players on the field, but also by amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players.
According to him, the shirt helps him track his own progress and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, the information of which is transmitted to the jersey on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The central unit is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not stated the exact time for the sale of the shirt, nor has it even hinted at its price, according to the Tech Times.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
California-based Athos has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost <0x24>100 apiece, and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs <0x24>200.
It was also written by Red Orbit.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds <0x24>1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who soon began his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later grades borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them out immediately.
“My math book would normally have cost <0x24>180; I paid <0x24>10 to use it for the entire semester, plus a big sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his books for the past semester would normally have cost <0x24>430.
Instead, he spent <0x24>120 on them.
According to the university’s board of directors, the average student spends more than <0x24>1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying significantly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company that operates more than 250 on-campus bookstores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in the university bookstores last spring were rented, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are sourced from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
E-shops
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained for one-third of the price it would cost in a bookstore on campus.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s “Calculus” book for the ninth edition is almost <0x24>290, but the book from Chegg.com, an online specialty book store, is available for <0x24>239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the notes of others and worn out appearance.
For example, "Calculus" book can be used at Chegg.com for <0x24>93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old student at Brigham Young University, said he bought "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" from Amazon.com for just <0x24>0.42.
The new book would have cost <0x24>48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the Amherst’s College Without Walls School at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used on the course.
Sometimes the reforms in the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can be found only for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider hiring textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By hiring, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a book "Calculus" for an entire semester costs about <0x24>20.
Learn about the rules of the rental company, such as the fees for notes, highlighter use and wear.
The renter, beware: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of regular papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the owner of the e-book is paid for the right to use it, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
The Chegg store sells the Calculus book as an e-book for six months for about <0x24>61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most, since several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and engineering can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing different vendors, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine’s law school, recommends using the book’s ISBN number to determine the price, as it can be used to make sure you’re looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure that the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this through the heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to buy the book at the full price at the university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in fires as last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have been killed in 49 fires so far.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
There have been 11 over 65-year-olds.
According to the organization’s fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me about repeating fire safety at home.
At least all fire alarms in the home should be ensured, according to Speck.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
There must also be a barrier-free exit route from all home facilities.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff City Hall for the so-called Counter Summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke to protesters who had come all the way from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australia’s Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were rescued after they were trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man set off after noon on Sunday for Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Families were worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A patrol of local police and aides was sent to look for young people, and the two were found at about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and struck his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, the soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have been fighting fiercely with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to a military spokesman, the gunfire on the other side has been so sharp that it is likely that the shooter will be Russian professional soldiers.
Seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the past 24 hours.
A Ukrainian patrol boat, which was hit by artillery hits in the Asovan Sea off the coast of southeastern Ukraine, sank this morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no idea where the ship was shot from.
Separatists reported on social media yesterday that they shot down the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the foreign minister, the negotiations in Minsk today should lead to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flood Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off many roads, disrupted traffic and buried cars underneath them.
Authorities on Sunday estimated that it might take some time to ease the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The Swedish authorities were surprised by the heavy rains, and no weather warning was issued in advance.
Ari Mustala, an on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rainland that affected the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French Socialists should “shut up and help France,” says Francois Hollande’s main supporter
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" for a socialist president in difficulty, whose new government did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"It's our job to stay by his side," Valls said, and he deserved a round of applause.
As a calming gesture, the prime minister urged the government to leave France’s controversial 35-hour working week despite a controversial proposal by the new finance minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused dissent by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs who expressed different opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the continuing socialist dissension and said she did not believe the new government in Valls would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war by telephone, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party’s proposal to dissolve Parliament and was confident of his party’s election victory in early elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France’s ruling party suffered a crushing loss in the March municipal elections and the far-right held the top spot in the May European elections.
According to a poll published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several rival groups before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Pokka betrayed Pokka of Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and Pekka Pouda seriously betrayed in the recorded part of the programme.
Last Thursday, the programme published on its Facebook page a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, the presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the ad buff from the next day’s broadcast, but the recording doesn’t go all the way.
Alm-Siira gets confused in her words as she tries to utter the word budget agenda, and her madness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their poop time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow as well," the Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo office in Lehtikuva, finished third in a series of portraits in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
The meeting of the Socialist International took place on Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture four or five meters away.
The light and the background were in place.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
It is clear from Meir’s face that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures taken of well-known people or events.
It’s great that nowadays you can succeed with other images as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén’s fall from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost over EUR 5 million
Investigating the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki in his dissertation on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki argues that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the information technology systems of investigations and legal proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multi-use of forensic material.
He points out that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected for the investigation of a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Vegetarian diet includes fish and chicken dishes"
A picture of a special news bulletin on the wall of a women’s school in Pirkkala caused food shortages on social media, Yle reports on her website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetarian lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetarian option!
That’s what a 15-year-old school report says.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send out indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of the Food and Cleaning Service, says to Yle that the note that was left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there was once such an idea, which was discussed with health care at the time.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about the vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle by saying that the young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave nutrition incomplete and the lack of meat or chicken may cause surprises for the students’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise closes <0x24>3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to acquire its rival, Prestige Cruises International Inc., for <0x24>3 billion.
The deal will give Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of <0x24>6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not be successful.
Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), the owner of Prestige Cruises, also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations were not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, and Apollo’s spokesperson declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with route maps covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue grew by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it reached <0x24>2.57 billion.
The Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brands, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was <0x24>1.2 billion, an increase of six per cent on the previous year.
The <0x24>29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
In January 2014, Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue in the U.S. stock market.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, which was worth <0x24>850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 by a merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested <0x24>1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo’s share of 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP’s share of 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document issued by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The City Council of Tampere is discussing this today.
Animalia hopes that the city council will support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Animalia’s Executive Director, who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end soon.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread belief around the world that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be taken to Tampere.
The abolition of the Dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for the dismantling of dolphinarium activities.
The death of Näsi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi Dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the dolphin’s original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more life than an unstimulated concrete pool,” Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Union Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support this demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins that will be held today, 1 September.
The Japanese embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin-hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed each year, either for dolphin use or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine on new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the divergent region, Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would need to be reconsidered in order to give the people of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call for negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region, thereby forcing the Ukrainian government in practice to grant the newly declared Novorossiya independence, enabling it to move to Russia instead of to the West.
In an interview with the state channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military’s attempts to recapture the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was captured by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossiya", the "New Russia" - a term reminiscent of the glorious days preceding the Russian revolutions.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks would be an "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We need to immediately start wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people who live there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “statehood” is related to broader independence, which has been discussed with the Kiev leadership for months in an attempt to alleviate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
“Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need,” Peskov said.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s interlocutory remark aimed at correcting the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlined that the Russian regime treats the separatist uprising in the eastern regions in a different way than it did in the case of Crimea, effectively invading an area in which the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin virtually power in the region that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, houses the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal sites.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products that are vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions other than Ukraine’s core region over their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest request to the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from the formerly peaceful region off the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed separatist town of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to seize the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to the massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel, which is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovsky and the narrow area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, pleading for further action to prevent future Russian insults in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders suggested drawing up additional sanctions so that they could be put in place should the crisis in Ukraine flare up again under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian troops detained by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian parachutists who were imprisoned on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan’s opening goal was scored by Japanese expert Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari and Jeremy Menez scored a penalty.
Lazio scored a penalty at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rebuffed Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
At the debut of Milan's former attacking icon Inzagh, the San Siro Stadium was only half full.
The total number of spectators was 39,000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelstein has announced that he is outraged by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko's nude photos.
The world of entertainment has been swarming since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet following a massive celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have in his possession a total of 60 nude photos of star star in Hunger Games, as well as other superstars such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne based Grecko were also reportedly stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Mr. Edelsten, who proposed to Mr. Grecko last month, told Confidential, “This is disgusting.”
All personal contacts and photos should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private data can be stolen and disseminated.
New York-based Greckon reportedly commented on the incident in an online magazine as “disgraceful” and said the victims “feel dishonored.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two photos of Palmer topless by the pool.
Palmer's film credits include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ that “this is a blatant violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing stolen mobile pictures is no different from selling a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if at home and won a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Volleyball Championship.
Check out the photos of the fans.
Poland’s Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish’s red and white, but Finnish’s blue and white.
According to STT, almost 2,000 Finnish supporters followed Finland’s victory in the Spodek arena.
I felt like I was playing at home.
The fans had such an impact on our game,” Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland lost the match with 0-2, but won with 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miraculous rise from six points.
Cuba already led the round 16-10, but after that the Finns got on top of the ecstasy.
However, a few hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
The fans in Warsaw were late for the game.
