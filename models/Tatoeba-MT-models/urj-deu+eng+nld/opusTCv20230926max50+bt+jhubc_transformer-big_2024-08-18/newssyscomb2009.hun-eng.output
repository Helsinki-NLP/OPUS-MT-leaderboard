Right-wing populists win in Austria with 29 percent
The appreciable weakening of the two parties of the Grand Coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were brought about by the first preliminary results, according to the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian provincial governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country’s strongest party, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), remains with 29.8% of the vote, but lost 5.5% of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP lost nearly 9% of the vote by 25.6%.
These are the worst results of both major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and the result, especially for the People’s Party, which brought forward elections, is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when he left the ÖVP coalition, the EPP had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to opinion polls.
However, the electorate clearly punished him for allowing the government to fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation has been expressed about the possible resignation of party leader Wilhelm Molterer and current Vice-Chancellor.
Observers believe that this could be done as early as Monday at a special meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate an increasingly probable way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties – the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously won 18% of the votes and the BZÖ had won 11% of the votes – the Social Democrats, however, expressed their fears about the re-unification of the European Union with the BZ<0xC3><0x89>P in the year of 1999 (when the EPP agreed on a common government).
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna for national politics, is obviously counting on this solution.
The Green Party, however, lost some of its popularity and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four-percent limit and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian ties may cool down
Failure to resolve the problem of Czech scientists reporting illegal beetle harvesting, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said some decoy could occur in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this in New York after a meeting today with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be a certain decoy," he said after the meeting, which took place under Czech stimulus.
After the trial, Mukherji said that it was difficult for the executive power to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who has been acquitted and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction is the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He could then apply for release on bail and be free to wait for his sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He offered to appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to acquit him," the chief of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide “competent legal support” to the convicted person, the Indian minister said.
However, he said that the Indian side has already provided them with such assistance.
“Our main interest with India is to maintain the best relationship with India, which has a long tradition.
That’s what the Indians admit,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a grave mistake," he said.
Asked whether the Indian side had promised to deal with the matter, the minister evaded the answer.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he remarked.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It moves to the wall electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a disappearing point in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the seabed next door.
The area is the same size as the continent itself," says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division’s 30-strong working group on ocean and maritime law.
His boss, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
There is a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources, barely known to date.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but there are also previously unknown living organisms that may be the key to the development of cancer medicine, for example.
Seabed larger than land
The coastal states are now intensively seeking new undersea areas.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental pedestal, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers off the coast of a given country.
Such a country shall have exclusive rights under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, we consider the continental shelf as the part of the seabed and the layer below it, which is the natural continuation of the undersea continent.
It extends beyond the coastal sea borders, often 200 nautical miles, so-called exclusive economic zones," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the Determination of the Outer Borders of the Continental Shelf should be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly studies and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
So far, the Commission has discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success has recently echoed in the world, making it the first country to significantly expand its undersea territory.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed area awarded to it by the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometres, or six times that of the country's territory.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting their applications.
They may do so within ten years of the date of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area declared by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive status here.
The right to extract in this field shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says director Mikulka exaggeratedly, saying that "some areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is contractually fixed."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also in the Czech Republic.
The former Eastern bloc shares this with other countries in the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organization, like investors in some other countries, was granted the status of "pioneer investor" under the Convention in 1991.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area checked by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed there is a sort of undersea copy of the Tatras.
“It can be extracted on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich source of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another Hindu lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian associate at the division, gives an example of another concrete.
It is reminiscent of a potato or, with a little imagination, a parchment with magical words that bring the Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage liberation.
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis – and experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
Eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being rescued.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the staff of the German Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Bureau of Crime, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were at the scene of the release.
According to information from ministry spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostages allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"This fortunately did not happen," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts were abducted on 19 September in southern Egypt.
Following a kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth across the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained unclear, as have the details of the release of the hostages or any ransom payments.
The survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were protected by the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his release.
In Berlin, no information has been provided as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on a German Air Force Airbus flight on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout.
The U.S. House of Commons has failed with a small majority the <0x24>700 billion bailout proposed for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went down.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 to reject the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program did not gain a majority in order to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
Supporters were desperately trying to convince critics of the need for a <0x24>700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the party’s chief negotiators, called for support, even if the plan is unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
The Dow Jones dropped more than 6% and 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then fell again after a failure was revealed.
Experts are expecting further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The program must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers are registering more and more bookings.
It is a good winter for German tourists.
According to one study, the traffic of road reservations for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ desire to travel did not fade, according to the study.
For the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in traffic compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October exceeded that of October 2007 by 11 percent, according to DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the number of bookings has increased by about a third.
In addition, Germany’s favourite destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
“Organized roads are the most sought after,” said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs of organised travel are "better calculated for passengers than for individually organised travel."
Passengers can save money with, among other things, advance booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth compared to the previous year can be recorded again - although according to another study, fewer German tourists took on travel compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, liters of beers and design dirndlit celebrities recurring without interruption.
Debut on Wiesen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really look much like each other.
She's blonde, she's a TV presenter, and she wears a tailor-made dirndl.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the scavenger shop.
But there is one thing that connects us: We’ve only been on Wiesen for three minutes, we’re already overrun by photographers and they’re filling up their memory cards – I’m very flattered, and that’s all on my first visit to Wiesen.
That way we can make friends.
The cheap dirndli seems to do its job.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the white sausage equator, my sense of comfort is still limited by the folk costume.
But arriving at Theresienwiese, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirt or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or awkward - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand can only be reaped by my dirndl apron.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I tied the apron wrongly: "You're free tied to the left, virgin in the middle, sold to the right, widow in the back."
I secretly crossed the bow from behind to left.
"That's good," he says and laughs.
Others make less fuss about subtle flirting techniques and wear a simple hat with the words "I'm too drunk to dress" and uninvitedly show off their naked asses.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, stretching the "aaaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after he gets rid of the contents of his previously drunk jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the infamous "forbidden urinators."
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances will be patrolling the scene and taking care of the poor vapors.
Nurses always appear in a team - four people carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrive empty, leave crowded.
Who's lying in the alcohol casket under the tarpaulin, you can't tell.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics yells at me for my question, and then in a whirlwind.
Police name the victim of the accident
Police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were burning with a desire to penetrate deeply into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, each with a tower at its front corner, and looks like a German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little overwhelmed.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what the westernmost gate of a large-scale business was.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the “late future” of the conquests, wanted to achieve its ambitions to occupy the Middle East with the help of this railroad from Damascus through Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded and destroyed the beautifully constructed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and history has gone far beyond it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to the railway to Anatolia and the whole of the eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, it serves as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Justice and Development Party in government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is characterised by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish parliamentarian Suat Kinikliogl.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of tumult, which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose - a developing suburban area, half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses, where suited middle managers - both men and women - meet to do business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right-centered politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has disrupted order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?" I asked.
“Turkey has never wanted to make a choice.”
He then emphasised what almost everyone I spoke to here almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey itself.
It is as if they were trying to convey the message that, in a figurative sense, along with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those railroads going east.
When I was at Hydarpasha station again, after another night spent mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conra, the two German gentlemen who had witnessed the reconstruction of this ornate structure a hundred years ago.
How they would have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe" at the time.
At the time, there was no question as to which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memorable Life Paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Vernon "Tod" Handley (Necrologian, Sept. 11, 1962) has been the director of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the district, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
In principle, only people under the age of 21 should have been included in the vocal arm, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any score they put before it - be it a madrigal or a piece of the Messiah; unaccompanied or accompanied by a grand orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astounding and always exciting, and we owed it to the man whose inspiration has kept our enthusiasm for music unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music play by itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the score.
So sing it.”
His conductor technique has always been fully understandable and accurate, but it is never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever the level of music, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If there ever was a conductor who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty years I have written criticisms of more than 100 concerts, but I have never been disappointed by one of them, and I have often been enthralled with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated those choirmasters who, in his words, simply "gapped around the world with a few well-known battlehorses."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25), "He continued his studies in economic history at Oxford in 1946 and became a Fellow of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950 . . . while constantly preparing for his bachelor's degree, master's degree and PhD."
This is from Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End" but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he published in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51, he was actually in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 he was in Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It’s unclear why Woodruff was embellishing this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
“I recommend J. Vicente Resino’s “Flamenco and Life” exhibition because his black and white, documentary-style photos are stunning.
The simplicity and power they gave me, as well as the respect for the people in the photos, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotions.
Resino is good at capturing magical moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of Jazz.
It is true that the interior of the new model is even more spacious, although the interior of the new model is already quite large.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the appearance of the new Jazz is very similar to its predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made to it.
These include innovative design, a new body, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we go into the details of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz came out six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda has been able to innovate this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but it breaks sales records in other markets.
For example, Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car brand in 2002 and 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of jazz have been sold since it was launched.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to increase traffic in the region further with the new Jazz.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz cars, by 2009 it is estimated that it will sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 units of Jazz in the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2,000 copies sold in one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda’s sales in Spain.
The company’s representatives are predicting 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact-sized hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units per year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market share would be made up of the United States, while the rest would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year after the official Valencia premiere scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five inches longer), its width 1690 mm (two inches wider) and the wheelbase increased by five inches, i.e. 2,500 mm.
Its height, however, remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment also became more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed on the one hand by the new body and on the other hand by the fuel tank in the middle - a solution that we already know from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo space of the so-called double-floored trunk has increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
However, these dimensions apply to the model with a 1.4 engine, as the 1.2 Honda Jazz has a 379-litre luggage compartment.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear led lights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seat doors was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the front Jazz to 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its launch, this small model is available with two 1.2 and 1.4 liters of gearboxes.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, both engines are more fuel-efficient than the previous model, with lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical alignment, while delivering outstanding engine performance in all respects.
The 1.2-litre engine delivers 90 hp at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which had 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 1.4-horsepower Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision-avoiding "bee car"
For the development of accident-prevention technologies, this time Nissan draws inspiration from nature, precisely from the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that imitates the flight of bees to avoid accidents.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technology Center built this small robot in Japan in collaboration with the renowned Tokyo University’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development, defines the BR23C as an extension of Nissan’s four-level safety cover.
The robot enhances the collision avoidance capability of the company’s products.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
More importantly, however, the compound eye of the bee, with which it sees at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, is able to fly uninterrupted in its own personal space.
To replicate the function of the composite eye, the engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
In a 180-degree field of view in front of the BR23C, the instrument detects obstacles within a distance of up to 2 meters, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance operation.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot mimics the movements of the uterus and immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid a collision.
What distinguishes the system from the currently available instruments is that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre takes place completely automatically.
If not, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, avoiding manoeuvres should not be directed up or down, nor diagonally, but only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the reversibility of the wheels, that is, not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
That’s why Nissan used a rotary function in the robot, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to avoid collisions.
“This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it’s not really gigabytes, but we’re not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates could enter production vehicles within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, it may be possible to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to get the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, besides having a lot of investable cash, lacks common sense.
Because of the crisis, and in order to keep Americans from getting entangled in the maze of questionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel."
It's the "Bad Loans Hotel"... which means "Bad Loans Hotel."
The flat, and especially the sad face of the receptionist, suggests that we should think again, twice or even three times, whether the time for borrowing has actually just come.
And especially where to apply for a loan, because that is probably the purpose of it.
The information on the website is indeed useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
But what would happen if we supplemented the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
In fact, it is something, since we dare not dream of buying an apartment...
Morgan Stanley Opens Capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank paying <0x24>9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the Morgan Stanley stock stock market plummeted.
A week after the preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of <0x24>25.25, or a total of <0x24>3 billion.
The agreed price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional <0x24>6 billion in convertible securities, which provide a 10% return and a conversion rate of <0x24>31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of <0x24>29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock price fell by 6.79% at 17:00 GMT, closing at <0x24>23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company," explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group of companies.
Morgan Stanley has approved a new status last week, allowing it to diversify its activities, while at the same time coming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with the MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from Wall Street-listed corporate giants.
The terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought the shareholding would consist entirely of ordinary shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid potential risks.”
As for the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than its book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share is reduced by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within a year if the trading price of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a certain period of time, i.e. it rises to about <0x24>47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can help you take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the group’s spokesman did not want to give precise information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had “decisively” improved since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great trial for the group, as the price of its shares has halved, while the cost of its non-payment risk insurance has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
The only remaining survivor of the big investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it has received <0x24>15 billion, some of which comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group of companies.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
The rebuilding of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the common plan of Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his vision for the new constitution on Sunday.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters voted yes in the referendum, according to the official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast unfilled.
A 50% + 1 vote was required to pass the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a counting by a non-governmental organization both proved the overwhelming superiority of the "yes" votes at 63% and 70%, respectively.
Rafael Correa spoke of the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) Observation Mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text summarizing the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, reserving the state the right to "plan development" for a country that essentially benefits from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by emigrants.
Correa’s draft constitution, which was elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the head of state, who can get a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the parliament.
Correa has already announced that she will take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again in February 2009 for the mandate as Head of State.
The President has already begun to introduce free health services and education in his country, which has a population of 13.9 million and half of the population lives below the subsistence level.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as a base for U.S. anti-drug measures.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers, who took 11 tourists and their eight companions hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight of their Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed in Chad this morning by an Egyptian commando.
They arrived by plane at the al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to Cairo International Airport, at around half past three in the afternoon.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a suburban suburb of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers "have not been paid a ransom," Egypt's tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were taken hostage on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in an SUV safari.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organizes the safari.
According to one Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special force arrived on the scene in two helicopters, where the hostages were raided just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," the leader said.
He also said that a total of 150 special troops had been sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian SWAT troops were added.
Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian task forces.
“We have to admit that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and task forces,” he said without further details.
He also denied paying ransom for the hostages.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that it had intercepted an SUV with the kidnappers, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two of them.
The military said the hostages were linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization immediately denied.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the news and the ongoing election campaign.
We should be happy about that.
But a slice of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who is going to raise their voices to highlight the ridiculous amounts of money spent on small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical sites on the brink of starvation?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that it ignores its monuments and buildings that are part of its cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, elected representatives and all government agencies.
The Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec) has more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies dedicated to history, cultural heritage, archives and genealogy, working on historical research and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological artifacts with minimal budgets.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with teeth and nails and protest with the last power of drowning, when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Fortis Bank to be nationalised by Benelux governments
The Benelux countries are helping with partial nationalisation due to the spill-over effect of the US credit market crisis – as the first European – on the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis: the three countries will support the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments discussed the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Commissioner.
Fortis Bank’s first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been rife in the waves for more than a year, therefore the bank’s decisions are, in some respects, a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, nearly half (49 percent) of all three states will acquire the bank’s existing assets.
The bank is likely to sell some of its interests, including, in particular, the insurance activities acquired from the Dutch company ABN Amro last year.
Fortis’s shares started to plummet last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious signs of a crisis at the institute.
Analysts agree, however, that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s papers plummeted to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the Group’s total market capitalization is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but managers say this is unrealistic.
The company also blamed the US<0x24>700 billion package’s acceptance of overseas market uncertainties for the decline in Fortis shares.
By Monday, the papers had risen slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but so far no one has come forward with a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with an applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that requires the use of prescription data in all cases with the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in independent hands, otherwise we will leave the chicken coop to the fox," said Richard Dick, the developer of the program to track prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damages dependent on the health of the applicant client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not even take out insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: pharmacies can easily get from a customer’s identification number what drugs they’ve bought in the past one and a half years, and the program itself infers what kind of disease they have and what their state of health is like.
For example, taking a high dose of cholesterol on a regular basis suggests that your blood fat levels are practically uncontrollably high, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also specify a risk multiplier number, so the insurer has little left to do outside the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages are that some drugs can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, while the former is not.
Separate companies have been formed to collect and process the data, and before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, they ask for the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although no penalties have been imposed for their failure to act so far.
Some companies are now processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data to provide an even more accurate picture of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult to control usage.
There is a separate Health Data Protection Act, but its scope is limited to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
There is a bill before Congress that gives the authorities control over companies that specialize in providing information.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough; therefore, he has improved his program, which would require the explicit consent of the data subject to transmit the data.
Another issue is that the data subject can hardly refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him or her.
So the hens are somehow dependent on the goodwill of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
India and the European Union are doubling trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit was dominated by this subject, along with other, largely global, issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will be discussed.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater say in international affairs, but the member states have not yet managed to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not raised at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the European Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years to more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion.
Given that trade in commodities rose from 25 billion in 2000 to 55 billion in 2007, this is not an ambitious target either.
In legal terms, they have merged the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, meaning that air traffic may also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only number nine among the EU’s partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism in all its forms on both sides, have been condemned and called for a UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha trade round, although both of them have played a large part in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed that a global deal should be made at the next climate conference and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital, where he plans to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair with a strong field.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th Buchmesse, the most important international copyright conference.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to host 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with a total surface area of 171,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters by establishing a unified Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Structure" hall of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where the data, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing will also be presented.
According to data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is steadily decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publishing.
The plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago, was found.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, sheriff of Madera County, said: “After determining the aircraft’s position, we sent a team out, and now we can be sure it’s the plane that Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Agency (NTSB) said it had asked a committee of inquiry a few hours after the wreck was discovered to identify the plane and establish that it was the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left for a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his Mammoth Lakes home.
Two I.D.s in Fosset's name issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was terminated a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has set up numerous peaks through which he has written himself into history.
In 2002, on a sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the earth without landing.
Several of his records also include flying over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original, and definitely designed hobby cruiser with large surfaces and clear corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact SUV”, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring a fresh impetus to the market.
This is precisely why the introduction campaign of the Mercedes-Benz SUV GLK, available in showrooms, will be surprising and unusual from 17 October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle uses a hitherto unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The billboard action, consisting of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with a three-dimensional presentation of the car, where the new SUV will be presented in almost real-world dimensions and in three-dimensional form with the help of special glasses distributed around the Corso Como.
The viewer of the picture will feel as if the car emerges from the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible, one by one, and then merges into a single image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotyped advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will you be able to attract the interest of prospective customers? We will see.
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are
Young people from Triveneto, they'll probably be blocked from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? Members of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never fought with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small sporadic groups from Campania and Apulia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were waved on which the hometown of the fans was marked: they were removed on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleader team, the Levski fans.
The Italian football federation provided 144 tickets to Italian fans. These were named tickets, making it easier to control the fan team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: there was no one who was going to Sofia to be prosecuted, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related criminal records were denied a ticket and were denied entry.
At the moment, the Ministry of the Interior is waiting for the minutes from the Sofia police and then taking the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots can be banned for five years.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to all stadiums in Italy, but also to all stadiums in Europe.
Therefore, our football hooligans cannot set foot on any football field.
Thankfully.
But we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that others will join in with the few hundred and fifty.
“This fire must be immediately suffocated, not excused, whoever behaves in this way,” the Interior Ministry said.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially as Wednesday’s national team match day is approaching in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell supporting the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observation Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Security Analysis Committee for Sporting Events, which can also count on a department of the Homeland Security Service, the secret services dealing with cheerleading behavior.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arm under the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria, no crime..."
This idea was expressed, in a rather unfortunate way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head the Ministry of the Interior's observation service (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and before that by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, it is not forbidden in Bulgaria to feed the Duce, but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, the first person in the observation service added, but crimes should be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s also talk a little bit about the flute of the Italian anthem: it’s not a crime, but, if I may say so, it’s not good manners.”
